#
# NOTES
#    Essentially all Postgres make files include this file and use the 
#    variables it sets.  
#
#    To override the default setting, create a Makefile.custom in this
#    directory and put your defines there. (Makefile.custom is included
#    near the end of this file).  Sometimes, a variable gets set in
#    Makefile.global after Makefile.custom has been included, so you can't
#    simply set that variable in Makefile.custom.  In those cases, there is
#    often another variable (like CUSTOM_COPT) that you can set in 
#    Makefile.custom that influences the later setting of the true variable
#    of interest (like CFLAGS) by Makefile.global.
#
#
#    If you change any of these defines you probably have to 
#       make clean; make
#    since no dependencies are created for these. (of course you can 
#    be crafty and check what files really depend on them and just remake
#    those).
#        
#    Before including this file, you must set the SRCDIR variable to the 
#    path of the top of the Postgres source tree (the directory that 
#    contains this file).

# CONFIGURATION SECTION
#
# Following are settings pertaining to the postgres build and 
# installation.  The most important one is obviously the name 
# of the port.

#  The name of the port.  Valid choices are:
#   aix            IBM on AIX 3.2.5
#   alpha          DEC Alpha AXP on OSF/1 2.0
#   BSD44_derived  OSs derived from 4.4-lite BSD (NetBSD, FreeBSD)
#   bsdi           BSD/OS 2.0, 2.01, 2.1
#   dgux           DG/UX 5.4R3.10
#   hpux           HP PA-RISC on HP-UX 9.0
#   i386_solaris   i386 Solaris
#   irix5          SGI MIPS on IRIX 5.3 or better
#   linux          Intel x86 on Linux 1.2 and Linux ELF
#                  (For non-ELF Linux, see LINUX_ELF below).
#   sparc_solaris  SUN SPARC on Solaris 2.4
#   sunos4         SUN SPARC on SunOS 4.1.3
#   svr4           Intel x86 on Intel SVR4
#   ultrix4        DEC MIPS on Ultrix 4.4
#   univel         Unixware 2.0x x86
#
# PostgresSQL has known problems/bugs on the following platforms:
#
#   nextstep       Motorola MC68K or Intel x86 on NeXTSTEP 3.2 or greater
#
#  Note that portname is defined here to be UNDEFINED to remind you
#  to change it in Makefile.custom.
#
#  make sure that you have no whitespaces after the PORTNAME setting
#  or the makefiles can get confused
PORTNAME= @PORTNAME@

# Ignore LINUX_ELF if you're not using Linux.  But if you are, and you're
# compiling to a.out (which means you're using the dld dynamic loading 
# library), set LINUX_ELF to null in Makefile.custom.

# somewhere else and putting that directory in your shell PATH)

# command line.

# NAMEDATALEN is the max length for system identifiers (e.g. table names,
# attribute names, function names, etc.)
#
# These MUST be set here.  DO NOT COMMENT THESE OUT
# Setting these too high will result in excess space usage for system catalogs
# Setting them too low will make the system unusable.
# values between 16 and 64 that are multiples of four are recommended.
# 
# NOTE also that databases with different NAMEDATALEN's cannot interoperate!
#
# THERE ARE REDUNDANT DEFINITIONS OF THESE VALUES IN config.h.
# Don't change anything here without changing it there too.

# COPT
#
# COPT is for options that the sophisticated builder might want to vary 
# from one build to the next, like options to build Postgres with debugging
# information included.  COPT is meant to be set on the make command line, 
# for example with the command "make COPT=-g".  The value you see set here
# is the default that gets used if the builder does not give a value for
# COPT on his make command.
#
# There is a nonobvious relationship between -O (optimization) and 
# -Werror (consider all warnings fatal).  On some systems, if you don't
# optimize, you will always get some warnings because the system header
# files will include some unreferenced functions in the code.  These are
# functions that are supposed to be inline, so there wouldn't ordinarily
# be an "unreferenced" problem, but if you don't enable optimization, no
# inlining can happen, and hence the problem.  Therefore, we include 
# if you override -O, you override -Werror as well.
#
# CUSTOM_COPT is something the user may set in Makefile.custom

# Common values for COPT are: -g for debuggable binaries, -m486 if you are
# using a i486 or better.
