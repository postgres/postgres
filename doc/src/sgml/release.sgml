Typical markup:

&<>                             use & escapes
PostgreSQL                      <productname>
postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf,
        recovery.conf           <filename>
[A-Z][A-Z_ ]+[A-Z_]             <command>, <literal>, <envar>, <acronym>
[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]+()        <function>
-[-A-Za-z_]+                    <option>
[A-Za-z_]/[A-Za-z_]+            <filename>
psql                            <application>
pg_[A-Za-z0-9_]+                <application>, <structname>
[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z_ ]*              <type>
[a-z]+_[a-z_]+                  <varname>

non-ASCII characters            find using grep -P '[\x80-\xFF]'
                                convert to HTML4 named entity (&) escapes

        we cannot use UTF8 because SGML Docbook does not support it

        do not use numeric _UTF_ numeric character escapes (&#nnn;),
        we can only use Latin1

        Example: Alvaro Herrera is &Aacute;lvaro Herrera

wrap long lines

For new features, add links to the documentation sections.  Use </link>
not just </> so that generate_history.pl can remove it, so HISTORY.html
can be created without links to the main documentation.  Don't use <xref>.

 <title>Release Notes</title>

  <para>
   The release notes contain the significant changes in each
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> release, with major features and migration
   issues listed at the top.  The release notes do not contain changes
   that affect only a few users or changes that are internal and therefore not
   user-visible.  For example, the optimizer is improved in almost every
   release, but the improvements are usually observed by users as simply
   faster queries.
  </para>

  <para>
   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
   viewing the <link linkend="git">Git</link> logs for each release.
   The <ulink
   url="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/"><literal>pgsql-committers</literal>
   email list</ulink> records all source code changes as well.  There is also
   a <ulink url="http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=summary">web
   interface</ulink> that shows changes to specific files.
  </para>

  <para>
   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item.  Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.
  </para>

<!--
  To add a new major-release series, add an entry here and in filelist.sgml.
  Follow the naming convention, or you'll confuse generate_history.pl.

  The reason for splitting the release notes this way is so that appropriate
  subsets can easily be copied into back branches.
