    Regular Tcl scripts of any size (over 8K :-) can be loaded into
    the table pltcl_modules using the pltcl_loadmod script. The script
    checks the modules that the procedure names don't overwrite
    existing ones before doing anything. They also check for global
    variables created at load time.

    All procedures defined in the module files are automatically
    added to the table pltcl_modfuncs. This table is used by the
    unknown procedure to determine if an unknown command can be
    loaded by sourcing a module. In that case the unknown procedure
    will silently source in the module and reexecute the original
    command that invoked unknown.

    I know, this readme should be more explanatory - but time.
