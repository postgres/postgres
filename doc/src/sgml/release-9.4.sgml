      Further restrict visibility
      of <structname>pg_user_mappings</>.<structfield>umoptions</>, to
      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <literal>USAGE</> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</> does not
      show the options in such cases, <structname>pg_user_mappings</>
      should not either.

      By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      databases.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing database,
      you will need to do the following:

        Restart the postmaster after adding <literal>allow_system_table_mods

        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</>

        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.
        In <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5 and later, you can use
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</>, undo that with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

      Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libpq</> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <application>psql</> or other <application>libpq</>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<application>libpq</>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <literal>md5</>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

      Fix concurrent locking of tuple update chains (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera)

     <para>
      If several sessions concurrently lock a tuple update chain with
      nonconflicting lock modes using an old snapshot, and they all
      succeed, it was possible for some of them to nonetheless fail (and
      conclude there is no live tuple version) due to a race condition.
      This had consequences such as foreign-key checks failing to see a
      tuple that definitely exists but is being updated concurrently.

      Restrict visibility
      of <structname>pg_user_mappings</>.<structfield>umoptions</>, to
      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Michael Paquier, Feike Steenbergen)
     </para>

     <para>
      The previous coding allowed the owner of a foreign server object,
      or anyone he has granted server <literal>USAGE</> permission to,
      to see the options for all user mappings associated with that server.
      This might well include passwords for other users.
      Adjust the view definition to match the behavior of
      <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</>, namely that
      these options are visible to the user being mapped, or if the mapping
      is for <literal>PUBLIC</literal> and the current user is the server
      owner, or if the current user is a superuser.

      Prevent exposure of statistical information via leaky operators
      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <structname>pg_statistic</>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      Restore <application>libpq</>'s recognition of
      the <envar>PGREQUIRESSL</> environment variable (Daniel Gustafsson)
     </para>

     <para>
      Processing of this environment variable was unintentionally dropped
      in <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.3, but its documentation remained.
      This creates a security hazard, since users might be relying on the
      environment variable to force SSL-encrypted connections, but that
      would no longer be guaranteed.  Restore handling of the variable,
      but give it lower priority than <envar>PGSSLMODE</>, to avoid
      breaking configurations that work correctly with post-9.3 code.

      Fix possibly-invalid initial snapshot during logical decoding
      (Petr Jelinek, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The initial snapshot created for a logical decoding replication slot
      was potentially incorrect.  This could cause third-party tools that
      use logical decoding to copy incomplete/inconsistent initial data.
      This was more likely to happen if the source server was busy at the
      time of slot creation, or if another logical slot already existed.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you are using a replication tool that depends on logical decoding,
      and it should have copied a nonempty data set at the start of
      replication, it is advisable to recreate the replica after
      installing this update, or to verify its contents against the source
      server.

     <para>
      In most cases this turned out to have no visible ill effects, but in
      corner cases it could result in circular references

      Ensure parsing of queries in extension scripts sees the results of

     <para>
      Due to lack of a cache flush step between commands in an extension

      Skip tablespace privilege checks when <command>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER

     <para>
      The command failed if the calling user did not currently have
      <literal>CREATE</> privilege for the tablespace containing the index.
      That behavior seems unhelpful, so skip the check, allowing the

     <para>
      This tended to lead to underestimation of the number of tuples in
      the table.  In the worst case of a small heavily-contended
      table, <command>VACUUM</> could incorrectly report that the table
      contained no tuples, leading to very bad planning choices.

     </para>

     <para>
      In simple cases this caused no ill effects; but for example, a

      Sync our copy of the timezone library with IANA release tzcode2017b

     </para>

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.

      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names
      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </para>

     <para>
      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <filename>posixrules</> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <literal>US/Eastern</> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <filename>posixrules</> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <xref linkend="datatype-timezones">).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes

      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

      Fix WAL-logging of truncation of relation free space maps and

     <para>
      It was possible for these files to not be correctly restored during
      crash recovery, or to be written incorrectly on a standby server.
      Bogus entries in a free space map could lead to attempts to access
      pages that have been truncated away from the relation itself, typically
      producing errors like <quote>could not read block <replaceable>XXX</>:
      read only 0 of 8192 bytes</quote>.  Checksum failures in the
      visibility map are also possible, if checksumming is enabled.

      Prevent failure of obsolete dynamic time zone abbreviations (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a dynamic time zone abbreviation does not match any entry in the
      referenced time zone, treat it as equivalent to the time zone name.
      This avoids unexpected failures when IANA removes abbreviations from
      their time zone database, as they did in <application>tzdata</>
      release 2016f and seem likely to do again in the future.  The
      consequences were not limited to not recognizing the individual
      abbreviation; any mismatch caused
      the <structname>pg_timezone_abbrevs</> view to fail altogether.

     </para>

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <structname>pg_timezone_names</>

      Fix possible mis-evaluation of
      nested <literal>CASE</>-<literal>WHEN</> expressions (Heikki
      Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A <literal>CASE</> expression appearing within the test value
      subexpression of another <literal>CASE</> could become confused about
      whether its own test value was null or not.  Also, inlining of a SQL
      function implementing the equality operator used by
      a <literal>CASE</> expression could result in passing the wrong test
      value to functions called within a <literal>CASE</> expression in the
      SQL function's body.  If the test values were of different data
      types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused
      to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.  (CVE-2016-5423)

      Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and

     </para>

     <para>
      Numerous places in <application>vacuumdb</> and other client programs
      could become confused by database and role names containing double
      quotes or backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe.
      Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name
      parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.

     <para>
      Fix handling of paired double quotes
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</>

     </para>

     <para>
      Introduce a new <option>-reuse-previous</> option
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</> command to allow
      explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
      previous connection.  (Without this, the choice is based on whether
      the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This
      allows secure handling of database names containing special
      characters in <application>pg_dumpall</> scripts.
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dumpall</> now refuses to deal with database and role
      names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical
      to quote those characters safely on Windows.  In future we may reject
      such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.
     </para>

     <para>
      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
      containing special characters could have been used to execute
      commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser

      Fix corner-case misbehaviors for <literal>IS NULL</>/<literal>IS NOT

     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard specifies that <literal>IS NULL</> should return
      TRUE for a row of all null values (thus <literal>ROW(NULL,NULL) IS
      NULL</> yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
      (thus <literal>ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL</> yields FALSE).
      The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations
      treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases),
      and <filename>contrib/postgres_fdw</> could produce remote queries
      that misbehaved similarly.

      The statistics collector failed to update the statistics file for
      shared catalogs after a request from a regular backend.  This problem

      but if one is up against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more
      XIDs during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very bad thing.

      Clear the OpenSSL error queue before OpenSSL calls, rather than

      This change prevents problems when there are multiple connections

      Fix inconsistent hash calculations in <literal>jsonb_path_ops</> GIN
      indexes (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      When processing <type>jsonb</> values that contain both scalars and
      sub-objects at the same nesting level, for example an array containing
      both scalars and sub-arrays, key hash values could be calculated
      differently than they would be for the same key in a different context.
      This could result in queries not finding entries that they should find.
      Fixing this means that existing indexes may now be inconsistent with the
      new hash calculation code.  Users
      should <command>REINDEX</> <literal>jsonb_path_ops</> GIN indexes after
      installing this update to make sure that all searches work as expected.

      Perform an immediate shutdown if the <filename>postmaster.pid</> file

     <para>
      The postmaster now checks every minute or so
      that <filename>postmaster.pid</> is still there and still contains its
      own PID.  If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though it had
      received <systemitem>SIGQUIT</>.  The main motivation for this change
      is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs will get cleaned up without
      manual intervention; but it also serves to limit the bad effects if a
      DBA forcibly removes <filename>postmaster.pid</> and then starts a new
      postmaster.

      Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses within regular

     <para>
      Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and
      parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing, according
      to the manual.  However, the code failed to handle these cases properly
      inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give unexpected
      results.

      Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of constraint arcs
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it didn't
      handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect, in that it
      could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be no bad
      consequences of that in a non-assert build).  Multi-state loops would
      cause the compiler to run until the query was canceled or it reached
      the too-many-states error condition.

      In <literal>pg_ctl start -w</>, test child process status directly
      rather than relying on heuristics (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, <application>pg_ctl</> relied on an assumption that the new
      postmaster would always create <filename>postmaster.pid</> within five
      seconds.  But that can fail on heavily-loaded systems,
      causing <application>pg_ctl</> to report incorrectly that the
      postmaster failed to start.
     </para>

     <para>
      Except on Windows, this change also means that a <literal>pg_ctl start
      -w</> done immediately after another such command will now reliably
      fail, whereas previously it would report success if done within two
      seconds of the first command.

      In <application>pg_dump</> and <application>pg_basebackup</>, adopt
      the GNU convention for handling tar-archive members exceeding 8GB
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The POSIX standard for <literal>tar</> file format does not allow
      archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern implementations
      of <application>tar</> support an extension that fixes that.  Adopt
      this extension so that <application>pg_dump</> with <option>-Ft</> no
      longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of data, and so
      that <application>pg_basebackup</> can handle files larger than 8GB.
      In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for
      members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms.  Potentially these
      problems could cause unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup
      files.

      The fix for <application>libxml2</>'s CVE-2015-7499 causes it not to

      This seems to be a bug, but we'll probably have to live with it for

      While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have seen
      too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL library and
      in our usage of it.  Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and
      later.  In the older branches, just change the default value

      Fix assorted planner bugs (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These mistakes could lead to incorrect query plans that would give wrong
      answers, or to assertion failures in assert-enabled builds, or to odd
      planner errors such as <quote>could not devise a query plan for the
      given query</>, <quote>could not find pathkey item to
      sort</>, <quote>plan should not reference subplan's variable</>,
      or <quote>failed to assign all NestLoopParams to plan nodes</>.
      Thanks are due to Andreas Seltenreich and Piotr Stefaniak for fuzz
      testing that exposed these problems.

     </para>

     <para>
      The external file containing query texts could bloat to very large
      sizes; once it got past 1GB attempts to trim it would fail, soon
      leading to situations where the file could not be read at all.

      Fix <application>pg_dump</> to handle object privileges sanely when
      dumping from a server too old to have a particular privilege type
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      When dumping data types from pre-9.2 servers, and when dumping
      functions or procedural languages from pre-7.3
      servers, <application>pg_dump</> would
      produce <command>GRANT</>/<command>REVOKE</> commands that revoked the
      owner's grantable privileges and instead granted all privileges
      to <literal>PUBLIC</>.  Since the privileges involved are
      just <literal>USAGE</> and <literal>EXECUTE</>, this isn't a security
      problem, but it's certainly a surprising representation of the older
      systems' behavior.  Fix it to leave the default privilege state alone
      in these cases.

      Fix possible failure to recover from an inconsistent database state
      (Robert Haas)
     </para>

     <para>
      Recent <productname>PostgreSQL</> releases introduced mechanisms to
      protect against multixact wraparound, but some of that code did not
      account for the possibility that it would need to run during crash
      recovery, when the database may not be in a consistent state.  This
      could result in failure to restart after a crash, or failure to start
      up a secondary server.  The lingering effects of a previously-fixed
      bug in <application>pg_upgrade</> could also cause such a failure, in
      installations that had used <application>pg_upgrade</> versions
      between 9.3.0 and 9.3.4.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <application>pg_upgrade</> bug in question was that it would
      set <literal>oldestMultiXid</> to 1 in <filename>pg_control</> even
      if the true value should be higher.  With the fixes introduced in
      this release, such a situation will result in immediate emergency
      autovacuuming until a correct <literal>oldestMultiXid</> value can
      be determined.  If that would pose a hardship, users can avoid it by
      doing manual vacuuming <emphasis>before</> upgrading to this release.

      Fix rare failure to invalidate relation cache init file (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      With just the wrong timing of concurrent activity, a <command>VACUUM

      that's used to avoid cache-loading work for new sessions.  This would
      result in later sessions being unable to access that catalog at all.
      This is a very ancient bug, but it's so hard to trigger that no
      reproducible case had been seen until recently.

      Improve planner's cost estimates for semi-joins and anti-joins with

     <para>
      This type of plan is quite cheap when all the join clauses are used
      as index scan conditions, even if the inner scan would nominally
      fetch many rows, because the executor will stop after obtaining one
      row.  The planner only partially accounted for that effect, and would
      therefore overestimate the cost, leading it to possibly choose some
      other much less efficient plan type.

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</>'ing data directory during
      crash restart (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would
      prevent restart on some platforms; but it is common to make SSL
      certificate files unwritable by the server.  Revise this behavior so
      that permissions failures are ignored altogether, and other types of
      failures are logged but do not prevent continuing.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also apply the same rules in <literal>initdb --sync-only</>.
      This case is less critical but it should act similarly.

      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </para>

     <para>
      It remains possible that some calls of the <function>*printf()</>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report

      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <filename>pgcrypto</>'s specific behaviors

      Protect against wraparound of multixact member IDs

     <para>
      Under certain usage patterns, the existing defenses against this might
      be insufficient, allowing <filename>pg_multixact/members</> files to be
      removed too early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions
      that would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and
      improving autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent
      multixact member ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID
      wraparound.

      Fix incorrect declaration of <filename>contrib/citext</>'s
      <function>regexp_matches()</> functions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These functions should return <type>setof text[]</>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <type>text[]</>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <literal>g</> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </para>

     <para>
      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <literal>citext</> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <emphasis>not</> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <literal>ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</> in each database in
      which <literal>citext</> is installed.  (You can also <quote>update</>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <filename>citext</>'s <function>regexp_matches()</> functions.

      Avoid waiting for WAL flush or synchronous replication during commit of

     <para>
      Previously, a delay could occur at commit in transactions that had
      written WAL due to HOT page pruning, leading to undesirable effects
      such as sessions getting stuck at startup if all synchronous replicas
      are down.  Sessions have also been observed to get stuck in catchup
      interrupt processing when using synchronous replication; this will fix
      that problem as well.

      Remove code for matching IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries to
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</>'s
      non-blocking mode (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <function>PQconsumeInput()</> upon read-ready.

      Fix buffer overrun in replacement <function>*printf()</> functions
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> includes a replacement implementation
      of <function>printf</> and related functions.  This code will overrun
      a stack buffer when formatting a floating point number (conversion
      specifiers <literal>e</>, <literal>E</>, <literal>f</>, <literal>F</>,
      <literal>g</> or <literal>G</>) with requested precision greater than
      about 500.  This will crash the server, and we have not ruled out the
      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
      the <function>to_char()</> SQL function.  While that is the only
      affected core <productname>PostgreSQL</> functionality, extension
      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.
     </para>

     <para>
      This issue primarily affects <productname>PostgreSQL</> on Windows.
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses the system implementation of these
      functions where adequate, which it is on other modern platforms.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      Fix <type>jsonb</> Unicode escape processing, and in consequence
      disallow <literal>\u0000</> (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, the JSON Unicode escape <literal>\u0000</> was accepted
      and was stored as those six characters; but that is indistinguishable
      from what is stored for the input <literal>\\u0000</>, resulting in
      ambiguity.  Moreover, in cases where de-escaped textual output is
      expected, such as the <literal>-&gt;&gt;</> operator, the sequence was
      printed as <literal>\u0000</>, which does not meet the expectation
      that JSON escaping would be removed.  (Consistent behavior would
      require emitting a zero byte, but <productname>PostgreSQL</> does not
      support zero bytes embedded in text strings.)  9.4.0 included an
      ill-advised attempt to improve this situation by adjusting JSON output
      conversion rules; but of course that could not fix the fundamental
      ambiguity, and it turned out to break other usages of Unicode escape
      sequences.  Revert that, and to avoid the core problem,
      reject <literal>\u0000</> in <type>jsonb</> input.
     </para>

     <para>
      If a <type>jsonb</> column contains a <literal>\u0000</> value stored
      with 9.4.0, it will henceforth read out as though it
      were <literal>\\u0000</>, which is the other valid interpretation of
      the data stored by 9.4.0 for this case.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <type>json</> type did not have the storage-ambiguity problem, but
      it did have the problem of inconsistent de-escaped textual output.
      Therefore <literal>\u0000</> will now also be rejected
      in <type>json</> values when conversion to de-escaped form is
      required.  This change does not break the ability to
      store <literal>\u0000</> in <type>json</> columns so long as no
      processing is done on the values.  This is exactly parallel to the
      cases in which non-ASCII Unicode escapes are allowed when the database
      encoding is not UTF8.

      Fix namespace handling in <function>xpath()</> (Ali Akbar)

     <para>
      Previously, the <type>xml</> value resulting from
      an <function>xpath()</> call would not have namespace declarations if
      the namespace declarations were attached to an ancestor element in the
      input <type>xml</> value, rather than to the specific element being
      returned.  Propagate the ancestral declaration so that the result is
      correct when considered in isolation.

      This message was originally thought to be essentially a can't-happen

      a nuisance.  Reduce it to LOG level, and expend a bit more effort on

      attempts to ascertain the user's operating system name, which on most
      Unix platforms involves reading <filename>/etc/passwd</>.  As of 9.4,
      failure to do that was treated as a hard error.  Restore the previous
      behavior, which was to fail only if the application does not provide a
      database role name to connect as.  This supports operation in chroot
      environments that lack an <filename>/etc/passwd</> file.

      Allow <varname>CFLAGS</> from <application>configure</>'s environment

     <para>
      Previously, <application>configure</> would add any switches that it
      chose of its own accord to the end of the
      user-specified <varname>CFLAGS</> string.  Since most compilers
      process switches left-to-right, this meant that configure's choices
      would override the user-specified flags in case of conflicts.  That
      should work the other way around, so adjust the logic to put the
      user's string at the end not the beginning.

      Tighten checks for multidimensional <link
      linkend="arrays">array</link> input (Bruce Momjian)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, an input array string that started with a single-element
      sub-array could later contain multi-element sub-arrays,
      e.g. <literal>'{{1}, {2,3}}'::int[]</> would be accepted.

      When converting values of type <type>date</>, <type>timestamp</>
      or <type>timestamptz</>
      to <link linkend="datatype-json"><type>JSON</type></link>, render the
      values in a format compliant with ISO 8601 (Andrew Dunstan)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously such values were rendered according to the current
      <xref linkend="guc-datestyle"> setting; but many JSON processors
      require timestamps to be in ISO 8601 format.  If necessary, the
      previous behavior can be obtained by explicitly casting the datetime
      value to <type>text</> before passing it to the JSON conversion
      function.

      The <link linkend="functions-json-op-table"><type>json</type>
      <literal>#&gt;</> <type>text[]</></link> path extraction operator now
      returns its lefthand input, not NULL, if the array is empty (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This is consistent with the notion that this represents zero
      applications of the simple field/element extraction
      operator <literal>-&gt;</>.  Similarly, <type>json</type>
      <literal>#&gt;&gt;</> <type>text[]</> with an empty array merely
      coerces its lefthand input to text.

      Corner cases in

      field/element/path extraction operators</link> now return NULL rather
      than raising an error (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For example, applying field extraction to a JSON array now yields NULL
      not an error.  This is more consistent (since some comparable cases such
      as no-such-field already returned NULL), and it makes it safe to create
      expression indexes that use these operators, since they will now not
      throw errors for any valid JSON input.

      Cause consecutive whitespace in <link

      number of characters in the input string (whitespace or not), then
      conditionally consume adjacent whitespace, if not in <literal>FX</>
      mode (Jeevan Chalke)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, consecutive whitespace characters in a non-<literal>FX</>
      format string behaved like a single whitespace character and consumed
      all adjacent whitespace in the input string.  For example, previously
      a format string of three spaces would consume only the first space in
      <literal>' 12'</>, but it will now consume all three characters.

     <para>
      When an <literal>AFTER ROW</> trigger is present, all columns of the
      table must be returned by updating actions, since the trigger might
      inspect any or all of them.  Previously, foreign tables never had
      triggers, so the FDW might optimize away fetching columns not mentioned

        more often than is implied by the text of the query; so don't do it

        Support time zone abbreviations that change UTC offset from time to

       <para>
        Previously, <productname>PostgreSQL</> assumed that the UTC offset
        associated with a time zone abbreviation (such as <literal>EST</>)
        never changes in the usage of any particular locale.  However this
        assumption fails in the real world, so introduce the ability for a
        zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
        Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
        feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
        abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
        In such timezones, <productname>PostgreSQL</> will now associate the
        correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.
