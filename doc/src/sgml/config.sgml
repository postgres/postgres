  <para>
   There are many configuration parameters that affect the behavior of
   the database system. In the first section of this chapter we
   describe how to interact with configuration parameters. The subsequent sections
   discuss each parameter in detail.

    <title>Parameter Names and Values</title>

    <para>
     All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
     value of one of five types: boolean, string, integer, floating point,
     or enumerated (enum).  The type determines the syntax for setting the
     parameter:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Boolean:</emphasis>
       Values can be written as
       <literal>on</literal>,
       <literal>off</literal>,
       <literal>true</literal>,
       <literal>false</literal>,
       <literal>yes</literal>,
       <literal>no</literal>,
       <literal>1</literal>,
       <literal>0</literal>
       (all case-insensitive) or any unambiguous prefix of one of these.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>String:</emphasis>
       In general, enclose the value in single quotes, doubling any single
       quotes within the value.  Quotes can usually be omitted if the value
       is a simple number or identifier, however.

      <para>
       <emphasis>Numeric (integer and floating point):</emphasis>
       A decimal point is permitted only for floating-point parameters.
       Do not use thousands separators.  Quotes are not required.

     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Numeric with Unit:</emphasis>
       Some numeric parameters have an implicit unit, because they describe
       quantities of memory or time. The unit might be kilobytes, blocks
       (typically eight kilobytes), milliseconds, seconds, or minutes.
       An unadorned numeric value for one of these settings will use the
       setting's default unit, which can be learned from
       <structname>pg_settings</>.<structfield>unit</>.
       For convenience, settings can be given with a unit specified explicitly,
       for example <literal>'120 ms'</> for a time value, and they will be
       converted to whatever the parameter's actual unit is.  Note that the
       value must be written as a string (with quotes) to use this feature.
       The unit name is case-sensitive, and there can be whitespace between
       the numeric value and the unit.

       <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
         <para>
          Valid memory units are <literal>kB</literal> (kilobytes),
          <literal>MB</literal> (megabytes), <literal>GB</literal>
          (gigabytes), and <literal>TB</literal> (terabytes).
          The multiplier for memory units is 1024, not 1000.

      <para>
       <emphasis>Enumerated:</emphasis>
       Enumerated-type parameters are written in the same way as string
       parameters, but are restricted to have one of a limited set of
       values.  The values allowable for such a parameter can be found from
       <structname>pg_settings</>.<structfield>enumvals</>.
       Enum parameter values are case-insensitive.

   <sect2 id="config-setting-configuration-file">
    <title>Parameter Interaction via the Configuration File</title>

    <para>
     The most fundamental way to set these parameters is to edit the file
     <filename>postgresql.conf</><indexterm><primary>postgresql.conf</></>,
     which is normally kept in the data directory.  A default copy is
     installed when the database cluster directory is initialized.
     An example of what this file might look like is:
<programlisting>
# This is a comment
log_connections = yes
log_destination = 'syslog'
search_path = '"$user", public'
shared_buffers = 128MB
</programlisting>
     One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
     value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant (except within a quoted
     parameter value) and blank lines are
     ignored. Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) designate the remainder
     of the line as a comment.  Parameter values that are not simple
     identifiers or numbers must be single-quoted.  To embed a single
     quote in a parameter value, write either two quotes (preferred)
     or backslash-quote.
    </para>

    <para>
     Parameters set in this way provide default values for the cluster.
     The settings seen by active sessions will be these values unless they
     are overridden.  The following sections describe ways in which the
     administrator or user can override these defaults.
    </para>

    <para>
     <indexterm>
      <primary>SIGHUP</primary>
     </indexterm>
     The configuration file is reread whenever the main server process
     receives a <systemitem>SIGHUP</> signal; this signal is most easily
     sent by running <literal>pg_ctl reload</> from the command line or by
     calling the SQL function <function>pg_reload_conf()</function>. The main
     server process also propagates this signal to all currently running
     server processes, so that existing sessions also adopt the new values
     (this will happen after they complete any currently-executing client
     command).  Alternatively, you can
     send the signal to a single server process directly.  Some parameters
     can only be set at server start; any changes to their entries in the
     configuration file will be ignored until the server is restarted.
     Invalid parameter settings in the configuration file are likewise
     ignored (but logged) during <systemitem>SIGHUP</> processing.
    </para>

    <para>
     In addition to <filename>postgresql.conf</>,
     a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> data directory contains a file
     <filename>postgresql.auto.conf</><indexterm><primary>postgresql.auto.conf</></>,
     which has the same format as <filename>postgresql.conf</> but should
     never be edited manually.  This file holds settings provided through
     the <xref linkend="SQL-ALTERSYSTEM"> command.  This file is automatically
     read whenever <filename>postgresql.conf</> is, and its settings take
     effect in the same way.  Settings in <filename>postgresql.auto.conf</>
     override those in <filename>postgresql.conf</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     The system view
     <link linkend="view-pg-file-settings"><structname>pg_file_settings</structname></link>
     can be helpful for pre-testing changes to the configuration file, or for
     diagnosing problems if a <systemitem>SIGHUP</> signal did not have the
     desired effects.

   <sect2 id="config-setting-sql-command-interaction">
    <title>Parameter Interaction via SQL</title>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides three SQL
      commands to establish configuration defaults.
      The already-mentioned <xref linkend="SQL-ALTERSYSTEM"> command
      provides a SQL-accessible means of changing global defaults; it is
      functionally equivalent to editing <filename>postgresql.conf</>.
      In addition, there are two commands that allow setting of defaults
      on a per-database or per-role basis:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <xref linkend="sql-alterdatabase"> command allows global
       settings to be overridden on a per-database basis.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <xref linkend="sql-alterrole"> command allows both global and
       per-database settings to be overridden with user-specific values.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

     <para>
      Values set with <command>ALTER DATABASE</> and <command>ALTER ROLE</>
      are applied only when starting a fresh database session.  They
      override values obtained from the configuration files or server
      command line, and constitute defaults for the rest of the session.
      Note that some settings cannot be changed after server start, and
      so cannot be set with these commands (or the ones listed below).
    </para>

     <para>
      Once a client is connected to the database, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      provides two additional SQL commands (and equivalent functions) to
      interact with session-local configuration settings:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      The <xref linkend="SQL-SHOW"> command allows inspection of the
      current value of all parameters.  The corresponding function is
      <function>current_setting(setting_name text)</function>.
     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <xref linkend="SQL-SET"> command allows modification of the
       current value of those parameters that can be set locally to a
       session; it has no effect on other sessions.
       The corresponding function is
       <function>set_config(setting_name, new_value, is_local)</function>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
     In addition, the system view <link
     linkend="view-pg-settings"><structname>pg_settings</></> can be
     used to view and change session-local values:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Querying this view is similar to using <command>SHOW ALL</> but
       provides more detail.  It is also more flexible, since it's possible
       to specify filter conditions or join against other relations.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Using <xref linkend="SQL-UPDATE"> on this view, specifically
       updating the <structname>setting</> column, is the equivalent
       of issuing <command>SET</> commands.  For example, the equivalent of
<programlisting>
SET configuration_parameter TO DEFAULT;
</programlisting>
       is:
<programlisting>
UPDATE pg_settings SET setting = reset_val WHERE name = 'configuration_parameter';
</programlisting>
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

   <sect2>
    <title>Parameter Interaction via the Shell</title>

     <para>
      In addition to setting global defaults or attaching
      overrides at the database or role level, you can pass settings to
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> via shell facilities.
      Both the server and <application>libpq</> client library
      accept parameter values via the shell.
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
      <para>
       During server startup, parameter settings can be
       passed to the <command>postgres</command> command via the
       <option>-c</> command-line parameter.  For example,
<programlisting>
postgres -c log_connections=yes -c log_destination='syslog'
</programlisting>
       Settings provided in this way override those set via
       <filename>postgresql.conf</> or <command>ALTER SYSTEM</>,
       so they cannot be changed globally without restarting the server.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      When starting a client session via <application>libpq</>,
      parameter settings can be
      specified using the <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> environment variable.
      Settings established in this way constitute defaults for the life
      of the session, but do not affect other sessions.
      For historical reasons, the format of <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> is
      similar to that used when launching the <command>postgres</command>
      command; specifically, the <option>-c</> flag must be specified.
      For example,
<programlisting>
env PGOPTIONS="-c geqo=off -c statement_timeout=5min" psql
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      Other clients and libraries might provide their own mechanisms,
      via the shell or otherwise, that allow the user to alter session
      settings without direct use of SQL commands.

   <sect2 id="config-includes">
    <title>Managing Configuration File Contents</title>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> provides several features for breaking
      down complex <filename>postgresql.conf</> files into sub-files.
      These features are especially useful when managing multiple servers
      with related, but not identical, configurations.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include</></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      In addition to individual parameter settings,
      the <filename>postgresql.conf</> file can contain <firstterm>include
      directives</>, which specify another file to read and process as if
      it were inserted into the configuration file at this point.  This
      feature allows a configuration file to be divided into physically
      separate parts.  Include directives simply look like:
<programlisting>
include 'filename'
</programlisting>
      If the file name is not an absolute path, it is taken as relative to
      the directory containing the referencing configuration file.
      Inclusions can be nested.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include_if_exists</></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      There is also an <literal>include_if_exists</> directive, which acts
      the same as the <literal>include</> directive, except
      when the referenced file does not exist or cannot be read.  A regular
      <literal>include</> will consider this an error condition, but
      <literal>include_if_exists</> merely logs a message and continues
      processing the referencing configuration file.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include_dir</></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      The <filename>postgresql.conf</> file can also contain
      <literal>include_dir</literal> directives, which specify an entire
      directory of configuration files to include.  These look like
<programlisting>
include_dir 'directory'
</programlisting>
      Non-absolute directory names are taken as relative to the directory
      containing the referencing configuration file.  Within the specified
      directory, only non-directory files whose names end with the
      suffix <literal>.conf</literal> will be included.  File names that
      start with the <literal>.</literal> character are also ignored, to
      prevent mistakes since such files are hidden on some platforms.  Multiple
      files within an include directory are processed in file name order
      (according to C locale rules, i.e. numbers before letters, and
      uppercase letters before lowercase ones).
     </para>

     <para>
      Include files or directories can be used to logically separate portions
      of the database configuration, rather than having a single large
      <filename>postgresql.conf</> file.  Consider a company that has two
      database servers, each with a different amount of memory.  There are
      likely elements of the configuration both will share, for things such
      as logging.  But memory-related parameters on the server will vary
      between the two.  And there might be server specific customizations,
      too.  One way to manage this situation is to break the custom
      configuration changes for your site into three files.  You could add
      this to the end of your <filename>postgresql.conf</> file to include
      them:
<programlisting>
include 'shared.conf'
include 'memory.conf'
include 'server.conf'
</programlisting>
      All systems would have the same <filename>shared.conf</>.  Each
      server with a particular amount of memory could share the
      same <filename>memory.conf</>; you might have one for all servers
      with 8GB of RAM, another for those having 16GB.  And
      finally <filename>server.conf</> could have truly server-specific
      configuration information in it.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another possibility is to create a configuration file directory and
      put this information into files there. For example, a <filename>conf.d</>
      directory could be referenced at the end of <filename>postgresql.conf</>:
<programlisting>
include_dir 'conf.d'
</programlisting>
      Then you could name the files in the <filename>conf.d</> directory
      like this:
<programlisting>
00shared.conf
01memory.conf
02server.conf
</programlisting>
       This naming convention establishes a clear order in which these
       files will be loaded.  This is important because only the last
       setting encountered for a particular parameter while the server is
       reading configuration files will be used.  In this example,
       something set in <filename>conf.d/02server.conf</> would override a
       value set in <filename>conf.d/01memory.conf</>.
     </para>

     <para>
      You might instead use this approach to naming the files
      descriptively:
<programlisting>
00shared.conf
01memory-8GB.conf
02server-foo.conf
</programlisting>
      This sort of arrangement gives a unique name for each configuration file
      variation.  This can help eliminate ambiguity when several servers have
      their configurations all stored in one place, such as in a version
      control repository.  (Storing database configuration files under version
      control is another good practice to consider.)

   <sect1 id="runtime-config-file-locations">
    <title>File Locations</title>

     <para>
      In addition to the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file
      already mentioned, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses
      two other manually-edited configuration files, which control
      client authentication (their use is discussed in <xref
      linkend="client-authentication">).  By default, all three
      configuration files are stored in the database cluster's data
      directory.  The parameters described in this section allow the
      configuration files to be placed elsewhere.  (Doing so can ease
      administration.  In particular it is often easier to ensure that
      the configuration files are properly backed-up when they are
      kept separate.)

     <para>
      In a default installation, none of the above parameters are set

      option or the <envar>PGDATA</envar> environment variable, and the
      configuration files are all found within the data directory.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you wish to keep the configuration files elsewhere than the

      command-line option or <envar>PGDATA</envar> environment variable
      must point to the directory containing the configuration files,
      and the <varname>data_directory</> parameter must be set in
      <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> (or on the command line) to show
      where the data directory is actually located.  Notice that
      <varname>data_directory</> overrides <option>-D</option> and
      <envar>PGDATA</envar> for the location
      of the data directory, but not for the location of the configuration

     <para>
      If you wish, you can specify the configuration file names and locations
      individually using the parameters <varname>config_file</>,
      <varname>hba_file</> and/or <varname>ident_file</>.
      <varname>config_file</> can only be specified on the
      <command>postgres</command> command line, but the others can be

         Specifies the TCP/IP address(es) on which the server is
         to listen for connections from client applications.
         The value takes the form of a comma-separated list of host names
         and/or numeric IP addresses.  The special entry <literal>*</>
         corresponds to all available IP interfaces.  The entry
         <literal>0.0.0.0</> allows listening for all IPv4 addresses and
         <literal>::</> allows listening for all IPv6 addresses.
         If the list is empty, the server does not listen on any IP interface
         at all, in which case only Unix-domain sockets can be used to connect
         to it.
         The default value is <systemitem class="systemname">localhost</>,
         which allows only local TCP/IP <quote>loopback</> connections to be
         made.  While client authentication (<xref

        If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a

        because <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also relies on the

        When the number of tuples to be sorted is smaller than this number,
        a sort will produce its first output run using replacement selection
        rather than quicksort.  This may be useful in memory-constrained
        environments where tuples that are input into larger sort operations
        have a strong physical-to-logical correlation.  Note that this does
        not include input tuples with an <emphasis>inverse</emphasis>
        correlation.  It is possible for the replacement selection algorithm
        to generate one long run that requires no merging, where use of the
        default strategy would result in many runs that must be merged
        to produce a final sorted output.  This may allow sort
        operations to complete sooner.
       </para>
       <para>
        The default is 150,000 tuples.  Note that higher values are typically
        not much more effective, and may be counter-productive, since the
        priority queue is sensitive to the size of available CPU cache, whereas
        the default strategy sorts runs using a <firstterm>cache
        oblivious</firstterm> algorithm.  This property allows the default sort
        strategy to automatically and transparently make effective use
        of available CPU cache.

      The intent of this feature is to allow administrators to reduce
      the I/O impact of these commands on concurrent database

      important that maintenance commands like

      quickly; however, it is usually very important that these

         Whenever more than <varname>backend_flush_after</varname> bytes have
         been written by a single backend, attempt to force the OS to issue
         these writes to the underlying storage.  Doing so will limit the
         amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the
         likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of a
         checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the
         background.  Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction
         latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads
         that are bigger than <xref linkend="guc-shared-buffers">, but smaller
         than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade.  This
         setting may have no effect on some platforms.  The valid range is
         between <literal>0</literal>, which disables controlled writeback,
         and <literal>2MB</literal>.  The default is <literal>0</> (i.e. no

         Beyond the threshold, old data may be vacuumed away.  This can help
         prevent bloat in the face of snapshots which remain in use for a

         would otherwise be visible to the snapshot, an error is generated
         when the snapshot is older than this threshold and the snapshot is

         A value of <literal>-1</> disables this feature, and is the default.
         Useful values for production work probably range from a small number

         of minutes, and small numbers (such as <literal>0</> or
         <literal>1min</>) are only allowed because they may sometimes be
         useful for testing.  While a setting as high as <literal>60d</> is
         allowed, please note that in many workloads extreme bloat or

         When this feature is enabled, freed space at the end of a relation

         condition.  All space allocated to a relation remains associated with

         This setting does not attempt to guarantee that an error will be

         has materialized a result set, no error will be generated even if the
         underlying rows in the referenced table have been vacuumed away.
         Some tables cannot safely be vacuumed early, and so will not be
         affected by this setting.  Examples include system catalogs and any
         table which has a hash index.  For such tables this setting will

        In <literal>minimal</> level, WAL-logging of some bulk

        This ensures that the database cluster can recover to a

       <para>
        While turning off <varname>fsync</varname> is often a performance
        benefit, this can result in unrecoverable data corruption in
        the event of a power failure or system crash.  Thus it

        you can easily recreate your entire database from external
        data.
       </para>

       <para>
        Examples of safe circumstances for turning off
        <varname>fsync</varname> include the initial loading of a new
        database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster
        for processing a batch of data after which the database

        or for a read-only database clone which

       <para>
        For reliable recovery when changing <varname>fsync</varname>

        Specifies whether transaction commit will wait for WAL records

        <literal>remote_apply</>, <literal>remote_write</>, <literal>local</>,
        and <literal>off</>.  The default, and safe, setting
        is <literal>on</>.  When <literal>off</>, there can be a delay between
        when success is reported to the client and when the transaction is
        really guaranteed to be safe against a server crash.  (The maximum
        delay is three times <xref linkend="guc-wal-writer-delay">.)  Unlike
        <xref linkend="guc-fsync">, setting this parameter to <literal>off</>
        does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating
        system or database crash might
        result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but
        the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had
        been aborted cleanly.  So, turning <varname>synchronous_commit</> off
        can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than

       <para>
        If <xref linkend="guc-synchronous-standby-names"> is non-empty, this
        parameter also controls whether or not transaction commits will wait
        for their WAL records to be replicated to the standby server(s).
        When set to <literal>on</>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received
        the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to disk.  This
        ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and
        all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage.
        When set to <literal>remote_apply</>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the
        commit record of the transaction and applied it, so that it has become
        visible to queries on the standby(s).
        When set to <literal>remote_write</>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have
        received the commit record of the transaction and written it out to
        their operating system. This setting is sufficient to
        ensure data preservation even if a standby instance of
        <productname>PostgreSQL</> were to crash, but not if the standby
        suffers an operating-system-level crash, since the data has not
        necessarily reached stable storage on the standby.
        Finally, the setting <literal>local</> causes commits to wait for
        local flush to disk, but not for replication.  This is not usually
        desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for
        completeness.
       </para>
       <para>
        If <varname>synchronous_standby_names</> is empty, the settings
        <literal>on</>, <literal>remote_apply</>, <literal>remote_write</>

        transaction commits only wait for local flush to disk.
       </para>
       <para>
        This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any
        one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it
        commits.  It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some
        transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously.
        For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit
        asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue <command>SET
        LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF</> within the transaction.

        When this parameter is on, the <productname>PostgreSQL</> server
        writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the

        This is needed because
        a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might
        be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page
        that contains a mix of old and new data.  The row-level change data
        normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore
        such a page during post-crash recovery.  Storing the full page image
        guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price
        of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.
        Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to

        <varname>commit_delay</varname> adds a time delay, measured in
        microseconds, before a WAL flush is initiated.  This can improve
        group commit throughput by allowing a larger number of transactions
        to commit via a single WAL flush, if system load is high enough
        that additional transactions become ready to commit within the
        given interval.  However, it also increases latency by up to
        <varname>commit_delay</varname> microseconds for each WAL
        flush.  Because the delay is just wasted if no other transactions
        become ready to commit, a delay is only performed if at least
        <varname>commit_siblings</varname> other transactions are active
        when a flush is about to be initiated.  Also, no delays are

        The <xref linkend="guc-archive-command"> is only invoked for
        completed WAL segments. Hence, if your server generates little WAL
        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived
        data can be, you can set <varname>archive_timeout</> to force the
        server to switch to a new WAL segment file periodically.  When this
        parameter is greater than zero, the server will switch to a new
        segment file whenever this many seconds have elapsed since the last
        segment file switch, and there has been any database activity,
        including a single checkpoint.  (Increasing
        <varname>checkpoint_timeout</> will reduce unnecessary
        checkpoints on an idle system.)
        Note that archived files that are closed early
        due to a forced switch are still the same length as completely full
        files.  Therefore, it is unwise to use a very short
        <varname>archive_timeout</> &mdash; it will bloat your archive
        storage.  <varname>archive_timeout</> settings of a minute or so are
        usually reasonable.  You should consider using streaming replication,
        instead of archiving, if you want data to be copied off the master
        server more quickly than that.

        There will be one or more active synchronous standbys;
        transactions waiting for commit will be allowed to proceed after
        these standby servers confirm receipt of their data.
        The synchronous standbys will be those whose names appear
        earlier in this list, and
        that are both currently connected and streaming data in real-time
        (as shown by a state of <literal>streaming</literal> in the

        Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential

        standbys disconnects for whatever reason,
        it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority standby.
        Specifying more than one standby name can allow very high availability.

        This parameter specifies a list of standby servers using
        either of the following syntaxes:
<synopsis>
<replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable> ( <replaceable class="parameter">standby_name</replaceable> [, ...] )
<replaceable class="parameter">standby_name</replaceable> [, ...]
</synopsis>
        where <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable> is
        the number of synchronous standbys that transactions need to
        wait for replies from,
        and <replaceable class="parameter">standby_name</replaceable>
        is the name of a standby server. For example, a setting of
        <literal>3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</> makes transaction commits wait
        until their WAL records are received by three higher-priority standbys
        chosen from standby servers <literal>s1</>, <literal>s2</>,
        <literal>s3</> and <literal>s4</>.

        For example, <literal>1 (s1, s2)</> and
        <literal>s1, s2</> have the same meaning: either <literal>s1</>
        or <literal>s2</> is chosen as a synchronous standby.

        no mechanism to enforce uniqueness. In case of duplicates one of the

        exactly which one is indeterminate.

        This parameter is useful in configurations where a node in recovery

    <para>
     The <firstterm>cost</> variables described in this section are measured
     on an arbitrary scale.  Only their relative values matter, hence
     scaling them all up or down by the same factor will result in no change
     in the planner's choices.  By default, these cost variables are based on
     the cost of sequential page fetches; that is,
     <varname>seq_page_cost</> is conventionally set to <literal>1.0</>
     and the other cost variables are set with reference to that.  But
     you can use a different scale if you prefer, such as actual execution
     times in milliseconds on a particular machine.

   <note>
    <para>
     Unfortunately, there is no well-defined method for determining ideal
     values for the cost variables.  They are best treated as averages over
     the entire mix of queries that a particular installation will receive.  This
     means that changing them on the basis of just a few experiments is very

       <para>
        Reducing this value relative to <varname>seq_page_cost</>
        will cause the system to prefer index scans; raising it will
        make index scans look relatively more expensive.  You can raise
        or lower both values together to change the importance of disk I/O
        costs relative to CPU costs, which are described by the following
        parameters.
       </para>

       <para>
        Random access to mechanical disk storage is normally much more expensive
        than four times sequential access.  However, a lower default is used
        (4.0) because the majority of random accesses to disk, such as indexed
        reads, are assumed to be in cache.  The default value can be thought of
        as modeling random access as 40 times slower than sequential, while
        expecting 90% of random reads to be cached.
       </para>

       <para>
        If you believe a 90% cache rate is an incorrect assumption
        for your workload, you can increase random_page_cost to better
        reflect the true cost of random storage reads. Correspondingly,
        if your data is likely to be completely in cache, such as when
        the database is smaller than the total server memory, decreasing
        random_page_cost can be appropriate.  Storage that has a low random
        read cost relative to sequential, e.g. solid-state drives, might
        also be better modeled with a lower value for random_page_cost.
       </para>

       <tip>
        <para>
         Although the system will let you set <varname>random_page_cost</> to
         less than <varname>seq_page_cost</>, it is not physically sensible
         to do so.  However, setting them equal makes sense if the database
         is entirely cached in RAM, since in that case there is no penalty
         for touching pages out of sequence.  Also, in a heavily-cached
         database you should lower both values relative to the CPU parameters,
         since the cost of fetching a page already in RAM is much smaller
         than it would normally be.

        Currently, constraint exclusion is enabled by default
        only for cases that are often used to implement table partitioning.
        Turning it on for all tables imposes extra planning overhead that is
        quite noticeable on simple queries, and most often will yield no
        benefit for simple queries.  If you have no partitioned tables
        you might prefer to turn it off entirely.

        By default, this variable is set the same as
        <varname>from_collapse_limit</varname>, which is appropriate
        for most uses. Setting it to 1 prevents any reordering of
        explicit <literal>JOIN</>s. Thus, the explicit join order
        specified in the query will be the actual order in which the
        relations are joined. Because the query planner does not always choose
        the optimal join order, advanced users can elect to
        temporarily set this variable to 1, and then specify the join
        order they desire explicitly.

        <literal>off</> (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve
        performance), <literal>on</> (force parallel query for all queries

        <literal>on</>, but with additional behavior changes as explained
        below).
       </para>

       <para>
        More specifically, setting this value to <literal>on</> will add
        a <literal>Gather</> node to the top of any query plan for which this
        appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker.
        Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used,
        operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited
        in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner
        believes that this will cause the query to fail.  If failures or
        unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used
        by the query may need to be marked <literal>PARALLEL UNSAFE</literal>

       </para>

       <para>
        Setting this value to <literal>regress</> has all of the same effects
        as setting it to <literal>on</> plus some additional effects that are
        intended to facilitate automated regression testing.  Normally,
        messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that,
        but a setting of <literal>regress</> suppresses this line so that the
        output is the same as in non-parallel execution.  Also,
        the <literal>Gather</> nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden
        in <literal>EXPLAIN</> output so that the output matches what

         This approach is often more useful than

         It is possible to log to <systemitem>stderr</> without using the

         server's <systemitem>stderr</> is directed.  However, that method is
         only suitable for low log volumes, since it provides no convenient
         way to rotate log files.  Also, on some platforms not using the
         logging collector can result in lost or garbled log output, because
         multiple processes writing concurrently to the same log file can

          The logging collector is designed to never lose messages.  This means

          collector has fallen behind.  In contrast, <application>syslog</>
          prefers to drop messages if it cannot write them, which means it
          may fail to log some messages in such cases but it will not block
          the rest of the system.

        When logging to <application>syslog</> is enabled, this parameter
        determines how messages are delivered to syslog.  When on (the
        default), messages are split by lines, and long lines are split so
        that they will fit into 1024 bytes, which is a typical size limit for
        traditional syslog implementations.  When off, PostgreSQL server log
        messages are delivered to the syslog service as is, and it is up to
        the syslog service to cope with the potentially bulky messages.
       </para>

       <para>
        If syslog is ultimately logging to a text file, then the effect will
        be the same either way, and it is best to leave the setting on, since
        most syslog implementations either cannot handle large messages or
        would need to be specially configured to handle them.  But if syslog
        is ultimately writing into some other medium, it might be necessary or
        more useful to keep messages logically together.

         This is a <function>printf</>-style string that is output at the
         beginning of each log line.
         <literal>%</> characters begin <quote>escape sequences</>
         that are replaced with status information as outlined below.
         Unrecognized escapes are ignored. Other
         characters are copied straight to the log line. Some escapes are
         only recognized by session processes, and will be treated as empty by
         background processes such as the main server process. Status
         information may be aligned either left or right by specifying a
         numeric literal after the % and before the option. A negative
         value will cause the status information to be padded on the
         right with spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive
         value will pad on the left. Padding can be useful to aid human
         readability in log files.
         This parameter can only be set in the <filename>postgresql.conf</>
         file or on the server command line. The default is an empty string.

         The <literal>%c</> escape prints a quasi-unique session identifier,
         consisting of two 4-byte hexadecimal numbers (without leading zeros)
         separated by a dot.  The numbers are the process start time and the
         process ID, so <literal>%c</> can also be used as a space saving way
         of printing those items.  For example, to generate the session
         identifier from <literal>pg_stat_activity</>, use this query:
<programlisting>
SELECT to_hex(trunc(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM backend_start))::integer) || '.' ||
       to_hex(pid)

        time stamp with milliseconds,

        internal query that led to the error (if any),
        character count of the error position therein,
        error context,
        user query that led to the error (if any and enabled by
        <varname>log_min_error_statement</>),
        character count of the error position therein,
        location of the error in the PostgreSQL source code
        (if <varname>log_error_verbosity</> is set to <literal>verbose</>),
        and application name.
        Here is a sample table definition for storing CSV-format log output:

<programlisting>

           The table definition above includes a primary key specification.
           This is useful to protect against accidentally importing the same
           information twice.  The <command>COPY</> command commits all of the
           data it imports at one time, so any error will cause the entire
           import to fail.  If you import a partial log file and later import
           the file again when it is complete, the primary key violation will
           cause the import to fail.  Wait until the log is complete and
           closed before importing.  This procedure will also protect against
           accidentally importing a partial line that hasn't been completely
           written, which would also cause <command>COPY</> to fail.

        This variable specifies one or more shared libraries to be preloaded at

        Some libraries need to perform certain operations that can only take
        place at postmaster start, such as allocating shared memory, reserving
        light-weight locks, or starting background workers.  Those libraries
        must be loaded at server start through this parameter.  See the
        documentation of each library for details.
       </para>

       <para>
        Other libraries can also be preloaded.  By preloading a shared library,
        the library startup time is avoided when the library is first used.
        However, the time to start each new server process might increase
        slightly, even if that process never uses the library.  So this
        parameter is recommended only for libraries that will be used in most

        This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait on a lock
        before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The
        check for deadlock is relatively expensive, so the server doesn't run
        it every time it waits for a lock. We optimistically assume
        that deadlocks are not common in production applications and
        just wait on the lock for a while before checking for a
        deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time
        wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of
        real deadlock errors. The default is one second (<literal>1s</>),
        which is probably about the smallest value you would want in
        practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it.
        Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time,
        so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before
        the waiter decides to check for deadlock.  Only superusers can change
        this setting.

        NULL</literal> (or <literal>NULL =
        <replaceable>expr</></literal>) are treated as
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> IS NULL</literal>, that is, they
        return true if <replaceable>expr</> evaluates to the null value,
        and false otherwise. The correct SQL-spec-compliant behavior of
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> is to always
        return null (unknown). Therefore this parameter defaults to
        <literal>off</>.
       </para>

       <para>
        However, filtered forms in <productname>Microsoft
        Access</productname> generate queries that appear to use
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> to test for
        null values, so if you use that interface to access the database you
        might want to turn this option on.  Since expressions of the
        form <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> always
        return the null value (using the SQL standard interpretation), they are not
        very useful and do not appear often in normal applications so
        this option does little harm in practice.  But new users are
        frequently confused about the semantics of expressions
        involving null values, so this option is off by default.
       </para>

       <para>
        Note that this option only affects the exact form <literal>= NULL</>,
        not other comparison operators or other expressions
        that are computationally equivalent to some expression
        involving the equals operator (such as <literal>IN</literal>).
        Thus, this option is not a general fix for bad programming.

        If on, emit information about lock usage.  Information dumped
        includes the type of lock operation, the type of lock and the unique
        identifier of the object being locked or unlocked.  Also included
        are bit masks for the lock types already granted on this object as
        well as for the lock types awaited on this object.  For each lock
        type a count of the number of granted locks and waiting locks is
        also dumped as well as the totals.  An example of the log file output
        is shown here:

        Detection of a damaged page header normally causes

        namely all the rows on the damaged page.  However, it does allow you to get
        past the error and retrieve rows from any undamaged pages that might
        be present in the table.  It is useful for recovering data if
        corruption has occurred due to a hardware or software error.  You should
        generally not set this on until you have given up hope of recovering
        data from the damaged pages of a table.  Zeroed-out pages are not
        forced to disk so it is recommended to recreate the table or
