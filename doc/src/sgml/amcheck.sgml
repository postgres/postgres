 <para>
  The <filename>amcheck</> module provides functions that allow you to
  verify the logical consistency of the structure of indexes.  If the
  structure appears to be valid, no error is raised.
 </para>

 <para>
  The functions verify various <emphasis>invariants</> in the
  structure of the representation of particular indexes.  The
  correctness of the access method functions behind index scans and
  other important operations relies on these invariants always
  holding.  For example, certain functions verify, among other things,
  that all B-Tree pages have items in <quote>logical</> order (e.g.,
  for B-Tree indexes on <type>text</>, index tuples should be in
  collated lexical order).  If that particular invariant somehow fails
  to hold, we can expect binary searches on the affected page to
  incorrectly guide index scans, resulting in wrong answers to SQL
  queries.
 </para>
 <para>
  Verification is performed using the same procedures as those used by
  index scans themselves, which may be user-defined operator class
  code.  For example, B-Tree index verification relies on comparisons
  made with one or more B-Tree support function 1 routines.  See <xref
  linkend="xindex-support"> for details of operator class support
  functions.
 </para>
 <para>
  <filename>amcheck</> functions may be used only by superusers.

      This example shows a session that performs verification of every
      catalog index in the database <quote>test</>.  Details of just
      the 10 largest indexes verified are displayed.  Since no error
      is raised, all indexes tested appear to be logically consistent.
      Naturally, this query could easily be changed to call
      <function>bt_index_check</function> for every index in the
      database where verification is supported.
     </para>
     <para>
      <function>bt_index_check</function> acquires an <literal>AccessShareLock</>
      on the target index and the heap relation it belongs to. This lock mode
      is the same lock mode acquired on relations by simple
      <literal>SELECT</> statements.
      <function>bt_index_check</function> does not verify invariants
      that span child/parent relationships, nor does it verify that
      the target index is consistent with its heap relation.  When a
      routine, lightweight test for corruption is required in a live
      production environment, using
      <function>bt_index_check</function> often provides the best
      trade-off between thoroughness of verification and limiting the
      impact on application performance and availability.

      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> tests that its
      target, a B-Tree index, respects a variety of invariants.  The
      checks performed by <function>bt_index_parent_check</function>
      are a superset of the checks performed by
      <function>bt_index_check</function>.
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> can be thought of as
      a more thorough variant of <function>bt_index_check</function>:
      unlike <function>bt_index_check</function>,
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> also checks
      invariants that span parent/child relationships.  However, it
      does not verify that the target index is consistent with its
      heap relation.  <function>bt_index_parent_check</function>
      follows the general convention of raising an error if it finds a
      logical inconsistency or other problem.

     <para>
      A <literal>ShareLock</> is required on the target index by
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> (a
      <literal>ShareLock</> is also acquired on the heap relation).
      These locks prevent concurrent data modification from
      <command>INSERT</>, <command>UPDATE</>, and <command>DELETE</>
      commands.  The locks also prevent the underlying relation from
      being concurrently processed by <command>VACUUM</>, as well as
      all other utility commands.  Note that the function holds locks
      only while running, not for the entire transaction.
     </para>
     <para>
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function>'s additional
      verification is more likely to detect various pathological
      cases.  These cases may involve an incorrectly implemented
      B-Tree operator class used by the index that is checked, or,
      hypothetically, undiscovered bugs in the underlying B-Tree index
      access method code.  Note that
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> cannot be used when
      Hot Standby mode is enabled (i.e., on read-only physical
      replicas), unlike <function>bt_index_check</function>.

  <title>Using <filename>amcheck</> effectively</title>

 <para>
  <filename>amcheck</> can be effective at detecting various types of
  failure modes that <link
  linkend="app-initdb-data-checksums"><application>data page
  checksums</></link> will always fail to catch.  These include:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Structural inconsistencies caused by incorrect operator class
     implementations.
    </para>
    <para>
     This includes issues caused by the comparison rules of operating
     system collations changing. Comparisons of datums of a collatable
     type like <type>text</> must be immutable (just as all
     comparisons used for B-Tree index scans must be immutable), which
     implies that operating system collation rules must never change.
     Though rare, updates to operating system collation rules can
     cause these issues. More commonly, an inconsistency in the
     collation order between a master server and a standby server is
     implicated, possibly because the <emphasis>major</> operating
     system version in use is inconsistent.  Such inconsistencies will
     generally only arise on standby servers, and so can generally
     only be detected on standby servers.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a problem like this arises, it may not affect each individual
     index that is ordered using an affected collation, simply because
     <emphasis>indexed</> values might happen to have the same
     absolute ordering regardless of the behavioral inconsistency. See
     <xref linkend="locale"> and <xref linkend="collation"> for
     further details about how <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses
     operating system locales and collations.

     Corruption caused by hypothetical undiscovered bugs in the
     underlying <productname>PostgreSQL</> access method code or sort
     code.
    </para>
    <para>
     Automatic verification of the structural integrity of indexes
     plays a role in the general testing of new or proposed
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> features that could plausibly allow a
     logical inconsistency to be introduced.  One obvious testing
     strategy is to call <filename>amcheck</> functions continuously
     when running the standard regression tests.  See <xref
     linkend="regress-run"> for details on running the tests.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     File system or storage subsystem faults where checksums happen to
     simply not be enabled.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that <filename>amcheck</> examines a page as represented in some
     shared memory buffer at the time of verification if there is only a
     shared buffer hit when accessing the block. Consequently,
     <filename>amcheck</> does not necessarily examine data read from the
     file system at the time of verification. Note that when checksums are
     enabled, <filename>amcheck</> may raise an error due to a checksum
     failure when a corrupt block is read into a buffer.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Corruption caused by faulty RAM, and the broader memory subsystem
     and operating system.
    </para>
    <para>
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> does not protect against correctable
     memory errors and it is assumed you will operate using RAM that
     uses industry standard Error Correcting Codes (ECC) or better
     protection.  However, ECC memory is typically only immune to
     single-bit errors, and should not be assumed to provide
     <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> protection against failures that
     result in memory corruption.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  In general, <filename>amcheck</> can only prove the presence of
  corruption; it cannot prove its absence.

  <title>Repairing corruption</title>
 <para>
  No error concerning corruption raised by <filename>amcheck</> should
  ever be a false positive.  In practice, <filename>amcheck</> is more
  likely to find software bugs than problems with hardware.
  <filename>amcheck</> raises errors in the event of conditions that,
  by definition, should never happen, and so careful analysis of
  <filename>amcheck</> errors is often required.
 </para>
 <para>
  There is no general method of repairing problems that
  <filename>amcheck</> detects.  An explanation for the root cause of
  an invariant violation should be sought.  <xref
  linkend="pageinspect"> may play a useful role in diagnosing
  corruption that <filename>amcheck</> detects.  A <command>REINDEX</>
  may not be effective in repairing corruption.
