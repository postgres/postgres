  <para>
   In general, a modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   The platforms that had received specific testing at the
   time of release are listed in <xref linkend="supported-platforms">
   below. In the <filename>doc</> subdirectory of the distribution
   there are several platform-specific <acronym>FAQ</> documents you
   might wish to consult if you are having trouble.

  <para>
   The following software packages are required for building
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>:

      <acronym>GNU</> <application>make</> is required; other
      <application>make</> programs will <emphasis>not</> work.
      <acronym>GNU</> <application>make</> is often installed under
      the name <filename>gmake</filename>; this document will always
      refer to it by that name. (On some systems
      <acronym>GNU</acronym> <application>make</> is the default tool with the name
      <filename>make</>.) To test for <acronym>GNU</acronym>
      <application>make</application> enter
<screen>
<userinput>gmake --version</userinput>
</screen>
      It is recommended to use version 3.76.1 or later.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You need an <acronym>ISO</>/<acronym>ANSI</> C compiler. Recent

      The <acronym>GNU</> <productname>Readline</> library (for
      simple line editing and command history retrieval) is
      used by default. If you don't want to use it then you must specify
      the <option>--without-readline</option> option for
      <filename>configure</>. As an alternative, you can often use the
      BSD-licensed <filename>libedit</filename> library, originally
      developed on <productname>NetBSD</productname>. The
      <filename>libedit</filename> library is
      GNU <productname>Readline</productname>-compatible and is used if
      <filename>libreadline</filename> is not found, or if
      <option>--with-libedit-preferred</option> is used as an 
      option to <filename>configure</>. If you are using a package-based
      Linux distribution, be aware that you need both the 
      <literal>readline</> and <literal>readline-devel</> packages, if 
      those are separate in your distribution.

      The <productname>zlib</productname> compression library will be
      used by default. If you don't want to use it then you must
      specify the <option>--without-zlib</option> option for
      <filename>configure</filename>. Using this option disables
      support for compressed archives in <application>pg_dump</> and

      Additional software is needed to build
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> on <productname>Windows</>.
      You can build <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> for
      <productname>NT</>-based versions of <productname>Windows</>
      (like Windows XP and 2003) using <productname>MinGW</productname>;
      see <filename>doc/FAQ_MINGW</> for details.  You can also build
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> using
      <productname>Cygwin</productname>; see <filename>doc/FAQ_CYGWIN</>.
      A <productname>Cygwin</productname>-based build will work on older
      versions of <productname>Windows</>, but if you have a choice,
      we recommend the <productname>MinGW</productname> approach.
      While these are the only tool sets recommended for a complete build,
      it is possible to build just the C client library
      (<application>libpq</application>) and the interactive terminal
      (<application>psql</application>) using other <productname>Windows</>
      tool sets.  For details of that see
      <![%standalone-include[the documentation chapter "Client-Only

   The following packages are optional.  They are not required in the
   default configuration, but they are needed when certain build
   options are enabled, as explained below.

     <para>
      To build the server programming language
      <application>PL/Perl</application> you need a full
      <productname>Perl</productname> installation, including the
      <filename>libperl</filename> library and the header files.
      Since <application>PL/Perl</application> will be a shared
      library, the <indexterm><primary>libperl</primary></indexterm>
      <filename>libperl</filename> library must be a shared library
      also on most platforms.  This appears to be the default in
      recent <productname>Perl</productname> versions, but it was not
      in earlier versions, and in any case it is the choice of whomever
      installed Perl at your site.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you don't have the shared library but you need one, a message
      like this will appear during the build to point out this fact:
<screen>
*** Cannot build PL/Perl because libperl is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Perl installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
</screen>
      (If you don't follow the on-screen output you will merely notice
      that the <application>PL/Perl</application> library object,
      <filename>plperl.so</filename> or similar, will not be
      installed.)  If you see this, you will have to rebuild and
      install <productname>Perl</productname> manually to be able to
      build <application>PL/Perl</application>.  During the
      configuration process for <productname>Perl</productname>,
      request a shared library.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      To build the <application>PL/Python</> server programming
      language, you need a <productname>Python</productname>
      installation with the header files and the <application>distutils</application> module.
      The <application>distutils</application> module is included by default with
      <productname>Python</productname> 1.6 and later; users of
      earlier versions of <productname>Python</productname> will need
      to install it.
     </para>

     <para>
      Since <application>PL/Python</application> will be a shared
      library, the <indexterm><primary>libpython</primary></indexterm>
      <filename>libpython</filename> library must be a shared library
      also on most platforms.  This is not the case in a default
      <productname>Python</productname> installation.  If after
      building and installing you have a file called
      <filename>plpython.so</filename> (possibly a different
      extension), then everything went well.  Otherwise you should
      have seen a notice like this flying by:
<screen>
*** Cannot build PL/Python because libpython is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Python installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
</screen>
      That means you have to rebuild (part of) your
      <productname>Python</productname> installation to supply this
      shared library.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you have problems, run <productname>Python</> 2.3 or later's
      configure using the <literal>--enable-shared</> flag.  On some
      operating systems you don't have to build a shared library, but
      you will have to convince the <productname>PostgreSQL</> build
      system of this.  Consult the <filename>Makefile</filename> in
      the <filename>src/pl/plpython</filename> directory for details.

      To enable Native Language Support (<acronym>NLS</acronym>), that
      is, the ability to display a program's messages in a language
      other than English, you need an implementation of the
      <application>Gettext</> <acronym>API</acronym>.  Some operating
      systems have this built-in (e.g., <systemitem
      class="osname">Linux</>, <systemitem class="osname">NetBSD</>,
      <systemitem class="osname">Solaris</>), for other systems you
      can download an add-on package from <ulink

      If you are using the <application>Gettext</> implementation in
      the <acronym>GNU</acronym> C library then you will additionally
      need the <productname>GNU Gettext</productname> package for some
      utility programs.  For any of the other implementations you will
      not need it.

   If you are building from a <acronym>CVS</acronym> tree instead of

      </indexterm>

      GNU <application>Flex</> and <application>Bison</>
      are needed to build a CVS checkout or if you changed the actual
      scanner and parser definition files. If you need them, be sure
      to get <application>Flex</> 2.5.4 or later and
      <application>Bison</> 1.875 or later. Other <application>yacc</>
      programs can sometimes be used, but doing so requires extra
      effort and is not recommended. Other <application>lex</>
      programs will definitely not work.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   If you need to get a <acronym>GNU</acronym> package, you can find
   it at your local <acronym>GNU</acronym> mirror site (see <ulink

   for a list) or at <ulink
   url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/"></ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about
   65 MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for
   the installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about
   25 MB, databases take about five times the amount of space that a
   flat text file with the same data would take. If you are going to
   run the regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra
   90 MB. Use the <command>df</command> command to check free disk
   space.

   The internal data storage format changes with new releases of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>. Therefore, if you are upgrading an
   existing installation that does not have a version number
   <quote>&majorversion;.x</quote>, you must back up and restore your

   Substitute your paths appropriately.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Make sure that your database is not updated during or after the
     backup. This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the
     changed data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit
     the permissions in the file

     If you need to preserve OIDs (such as when using them as
     foreign keys), then use the <option>-o</option> option when running
     <application>pg_dumpall</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     To make the backup, you can use the <application>pg_dumpall</application>
     command from the version you are currently running.  For best
     results, however, try to use the <application>pg_dumpall</application>
     command from <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> &version;,
     since this version contains bug fixes and improvements over older
     versions.  While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you
     haven't installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow
     it if you plan to install the new version in parallel with the
     old version.  In that case you can complete the installation
     normally and transfer the data later.  This will also decrease
     the downtime.
    </para>

   <step>
    <para>
     If you are installing the new version at the same location as the
     old one then shut down the old server, at the latest before you
     install the new files:
<screen>
<userinput>pg_ctl stop</>
</screen>
     On systems that have <productname>PostgreSQL</> started at boot time,
     there is probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For

   <step>
    <para>
     If you are installing in the same place as the old version then
     it is also a good idea to move the old installation out of the
     way, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.
     Use a command like this:

   <para>
    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <filename>configure</> script. For a
    default installation simply enter
<screen>
<userinput>./configure</userinput>
</screen>
    This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
    system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  (You can also run
    <filename>configure</filename> in a directory outside the source
    tree if you want to keep the build directory separate.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> by default.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more of the following command line options to
    <filename>configure</filename>:

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term><option>--prefix=<replaceable>PREFIX</></option></term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Install all files under the directory <replaceable>PREFIX</>
         instead of <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename>. The actual
         files will be installed into various subdirectories; no files
         will ever be installed directly into the
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> directory.
        </para>

        <para>
         If you have special needs, you can also customize the
         individual subdirectories with the following options. However,
         if you leave these with their defaults, the installation will be
         relocatable, meaning you can move the directory after
         installation. (The <literal>man</> and <literal>doc</>
         locations are not affected by this.)
        </para>

        <para>
         For relocatable installs, you might want to use 
         <filename>configure</filename>'s <literal>--disable-rpath</>
         option.  Also, you will need to tell the operating system how
         to find the shared libraries.

         share architecture-independent files between hosts. If you
         omit this, then <replaceable>EXEC-PREFIX</> is set equal to
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> and both architecture-dependent and

       Care has been taken to make it possible to install
       <productname>PostgreSQL</> into shared installation locations
       (such as <filename>/usr/local/include</filename>) without
       interfering with the namespace of the rest of the system. First,
       the string <quote><literal>/postgresql</literal></quote> is
       automatically appended to <varname>datadir</varname>,
       <varname>sysconfdir</varname>, and <varname>docdir</varname>,
       unless the fully expanded directory name already contains the
       string <quote><literal>postgres</></quote> or
       <quote><literal>pgsql</></quote>. For example, if you choose
       <filename>/usr/local</filename> as prefix, the documentation will
       be installed in <filename>/usr/local/doc/postgresql</filename>,
       but if the prefix is <filename>/opt/postgres</filename>, then it
       will be in <filename>/opt/postgres/doc</filename>. The public C
       header files of the client interfaces are installed into
       <varname>includedir</varname> and are namespace-clean. The
       internal header files and the server header files are installed
       into private directories under <varname>includedir</varname>. See
       the documentation of each interface for information about how to
       get at the its header files. Finally, a private subdirectory will
       also be created, if appropriate, under <varname>libdir</varname>
       for dynamically loadable modules.

         Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging symbols.
         This means that you can run the programs through a debugger
         to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of the installed
         executables considerably, and on non-GCC compilers it usually
         also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,
         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing
         with any problems that may arise.  Currently, this option is
         recommended for production installations only if you use GCC.
         But you should always have it on if you are doing development work
         or running a beta version.

         Also, having the tests turned on won't necessarily enhance the
         stability of your server!  The assertion checks are not categorized
         for severity, and so what might be a relatively harmless bug will
         still lead to server restarts if it triggers an assertion
         failure.  Currently, this option is not recommended for
         production use, but you should have it on for development work

   <note>
    <para>
     If you are upgrading an existing system and are going to install
     the new files over the old ones, be sure to back up
     your data and shut down the old server before proceeding, as explained in
     <xref linkend="install-upgrading"> above.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    To install <productname>PostgreSQL</> enter
<screen>
<userinput>gmake install</userinput>
</screen>
    This will install files into the directories that were specified
    in <xref linkend="configure">. Make sure that you have appropriate
    permissions to write into that area. Normally you need to do this
    step as root. Alternatively, you could create the target
    directories in advance and arrange for appropriate permissions to
    be granted.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can use <literal>gmake install-strip</literal> instead of
    <literal>gmake install</literal> to strip the executable files and
    libraries as they are installed.  This will save some space.  If
    you built with debugging support, stripping will effectively
    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <literal>install-strip</literal>
    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.
   </para>

   <para>
    The standard installation provides all the header files needed for client
    application development as well as for server-side program
    development, such as custom functions or data types written in C.
    (Prior to <productname>PostgreSQL</> 8.0, a separate <literal>gmake
    install-all-headers</> command was needed for the latter, but this
    step has been folded into the standard install.)
   </para>

   <formalpara>
    <title>Client-only installation:</title>

<userinput>gmake -C src/include install</>
<userinput>gmake -C src/interfaces install</>
<userinput>gmake -C doc install</>

   <para>
    To register a <systemitem class="osname">Windows</> <application>eventlog</>
    library with the operating system, issue this command after installation:
<screen>
<userinput>regsvr32 <replaceable>pgsql_library_directory</>/pgevent.dll</>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Cleaning:</title>

   <para>
    After the installation you can make room by removing the built
    files from the source tree with the command <command>gmake
    clean</>. This will preserve the files made by the <command>configure</command>
    program, so that you can rebuild everything with <command>gmake</>
    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <command>gmake distclean</>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms within the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each build.  (Alternatively, use
    a separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree
    remains unmodified.)
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   If you perform a build and then discover that your <command>configure</>
   options were wrong, or if you change anything that <command>configure</>
   investigates (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good
   idea to do <command>gmake distclean</> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   may not propagate everywhere they need to.

   <indexterm>
    <primary>shared library</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    On some systems that have shared libraries (which most systems do)
    you need to tell your system how to find the newly installed
    shared libraries.  The systems on which this is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary include <systemitem
    class="osname">BSD/OS</>, <systemitem class="osname">FreeBSD</>,
    <systemitem class="osname">HP-UX</>, <systemitem
    class="osname">IRIX</>, <systemitem class="osname">Linux</>,
    <systemitem class="osname">NetBSD</>, <systemitem
    class="osname">OpenBSD</>, <systemitem class="osname">Tru64
    UNIX</> (formerly <systemitem class="osname">Digital UNIX</>), and
    <systemitem class="osname">Solaris</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The method to set the shared library search path varies between
    platforms, but the most widely usable method is to set the
    environment variable <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</> like so: In Bourne
    shells (<command>sh</>, <command>ksh</>, <command>bash</>, <command>zsh</>)
<programlisting>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
    or in <command>csh</> or <command>tcsh</>
<programlisting>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    Replace <literal>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</> with whatever you set
    <option><literal>--libdir</></> to in <xref linkend="configure">.
    You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such as
    <filename>/etc/profile</> or <filename>~/.bash_profile</>.  Some
    good information about the caveats associated with this method can
    be found at <ulink
    url="http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html"></ulink>.
   </para>

   <para>
    On some systems it might be preferable to set the environment
    variable <envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar> <emphasis>before</emphasis>
    building.
   </para>

   <para>
    On <systemitem class="osname">Cygwin</systemitem>, put the library
    directory in the <envar>PATH</envar> or move the
    <filename>.dll</filename> files into the <filename>bin</filename>
    directory.
   </para>

   <para>
    If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps
    <command>ld.so</command> or <command>rld</command>). If you later
    on get a message like
<screen>
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</screen>
    then this step was necessary.  Simply take care of it then.

    If you are on <systemitem class="osname">BSD/OS</>, <systemitem

    and you have root access you can run
<programlisting>
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    (or equivalent directory) after installation to enable the
    run-time linker to find the shared libraries faster.  Refer to the
    manual page of <command>ldconfig</> for more information.  On
    <systemitem class="osname">FreeBSD</>, <systemitem
    class="osname">NetBSD</>, and <systemitem
    class="osname">OpenBSD</> the command is
<programlisting>
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/local/pgsql/lib

    instead.  Other systems are not known to have an equivalent
    command.

   <para>
    If you installed into <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> or some other
    location that is not searched for programs by default, you should
    add <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</> (or whatever you set
    <option><literal>--bindir</></> to in <xref linkend="configure">)
    into your <envar>PATH</>.  Strictly speaking, this is not
    necessary, but it will make the use of <productname>PostgreSQL</>
    much more convenient.
   </para>

   <para>
    To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as
    <filename>~/.bash_profile</> (or <filename>/etc/profile</>, if you
    want it to affect every user):
<programlisting>
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH

    <indexterm>
     <primary><envar>MANPATH</envar></primary>

    To enable your system to find the <application>man</>

    searched by default.
<programlisting>
MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/man:$MANPATH
export MANPATH
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    The environment variables <envar>PGHOST</> and <envar>PGPORT</>
    specify to client applications the host and port of the database
    server, overriding the compiled-in defaults. If you are going to
    run client applications remotely then it is convenient if every
    user that plans to use the database sets <envar>PGHOST</>.  This
    is not required, however: the settings can be communicated via command
    line options to most client programs.

     enough, but running the server as root is a security risk and

   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Create a database installation with the <command>initdb</>

    <para>
     The <option>-D</> option specifies the location where the data
     will be stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have
     to be under the installation directory. Just make sure that the
     server account can write to the directory (or create it, if it
     doesn't already exist) before starting <command>initdb</>, as
     illustrated here.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     The previous step should have told you how to start up the
     database server. Do so now. The command should look something
     like
<programlisting>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</programlisting>
     This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server

nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    &lt;/dev/null &gt;&gt;server.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt;/dev/null &amp;
