    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      PostgreSQL alpha releases are snapshots of development code. They
      are intended to preview and test upcoming features and to provide
      the possibility for early feedback. They should not be used in
      production installations or active development projects. While the
      PostgreSQL code is continuously subject to a number of automated
      and manual tests, alpha releases might have serious bugs. Also
      features may be changed incompatibly or removed at any time during
      the development cycle.
    </para>
    <para>
      The development cycle of a PostgreSQL major release alternates
      between periods of development and periods of integration work,
      called commit fests, normally one month each. Alpha releases are
      planned to be produced at the end of every commit fest, thus every
      two months. Since the first commit fest starts within a month from
      the beginning of development altogether, early alpha releases are
      not indicative of the likely feature set of the final release.
    </para>
    <para>
      The release notes below highlight user visible changes and new
      features. There are normally numerous bug fixes and performance
      improvements in every new snapshot of PostgreSQL, and it would be
      too bulky to attempt to list them all. Note that many bug fixes are
      also backported to stable releases of PostgreSQL, and you should be
      using those if you are looking for bug-fix-only upgrades for your
      current installations.
    </para>
    <para>
      These notes are cumulative over all alpha releases of the current
      development cycle.  Items that are new in the latest alpha release are

    <title>Migration</title>
    <para>
      To upgrade from any release to an alpha release or from an alpha
      release to any other release will most likely require a
      dump/restore upgrade procedure. It may happen that this is not
      necessary in particular cases, but that is not verified beforehand.
      (The server will warn you in any case when a dump/restore is
      necessary if you attempt to use it with an old data directory.)
      Note, however, that the dump/restore upgrade procedure is expected
      to work for alpha releases, and problems in this area should be
      reported.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Testing</title>
    <para>
      The primary reason we release alphas is to get users to test new
      features as early as possible.  If you are interested in helping
      with organized testing, please see
      <ulink url="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/HowToBetaTest">the
      testing information page</ulink>.

         <emphasis>Support named restore points</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
         Named restore points can be created using a new server function,
         pg_create_restore_point.  A new recovery.conf parameter,
         recovery_target_name, allows recovery to stop at a named restore
         point.

        </para>

        <para>
         Previously, the sequence restart did not roll back on error.
         This meant that an error between truncating and committing
         left the sequences out of sync with the table contents, with
         potentially bad consequences as were noted in a Warning on
         the TRUNCATE man page.

         Support triggers on views
        </para>

        <para>
         This adds the SQL-standard concept of an INSTEAD OF trigger,
         which is fired instead of performing a physical
         insert/update/delete.  The trigger function is passed the
         entire old and/or new rows of the view, and must figure out
         what to do to the underlying tables to implement the update.
         So this feature can be used to implement updatable views
         using trigger programming style rather than rule hacking.

         Recognize functional dependency on primary

        <para>
         This allows a table's other columns to be referenced without listing
         them in GROUP BY, so long as the primary key column(s) are listed in
         GROUP BY.

        <para>
         This is analagous to the existing facility that allows casting a row

        <para>
         Foreign tables are component of SQL/MED, and provide a framework to
         allow data stored outside the database to be accessed via SQL.
         contrib/file_fdw is provided as a sample foreign data wrapper.

        <para>
         In previous releases, the REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE isolation
         levels were identical.  The historical behavior of REPEATABLE READ is
         unchanged in this release, but SERIALIZABLE now provides stronger

        </para>
        <para>
         Portals, SQL functions, and SPI all now agree that a completely new
         MVCC snapshot should be obtained only after fully executing each
         original query.  This is equivalent to the prior behavior of EXPLAIN
         ANALYZE.  It eliminates one source of concurrency hazards for
         rules, and should also be marginally faster.

        <para>
         This eliminates the former need to sort the output of an
         Append scan when an ordered scan of an inheritance tree is
         wanted.  This should be particularly useful for fast-start
         cases such as queries with LIMIT.

        </para>
        <para>
         The contents of an unlogged table are not WAL-logged; thus, they
         are not replicated and are truncated whenever the database system
         enters recovery.  Indexes on unlogged tables are also unlogged, but
         GIST indexes on unlogged tables are not currently supported.

        <para>
         Previously, full joins could be implemented only as a merge join,
         and left and right outer joins could only hash the table on the
         nullable side of the join.  This optimization is particularly
         advantageous when the non-nullable side of a left or right outer
         join is much smaller than the nullable side.

         Remove ancient PL/pgSQL line numbering hack

         PL/pgSQL used to count the second line of the function body as

         While this hack arguably has some benefit in terms of making
         PL/pgsql's line numbering match the programmer's expectations, it
         also makes PL/pgsql inconsistent with the remaining PLs, making it
         difficult for clients to reliably determine where the error
         actually is.  On balance, it seems better to be consistent.

          instead arrange to report PostgreSQL errors to Python immediately.
          Call PLy_spi_execute_fetch_result inside the try/catch block, so that
          errors from fetching tuples are correct reported as errors in the
          SPI call.  Use the built-in TypeError, not SPIError, for errors
          having to do with argument counts or types.  Use SPIError, not simply
          plpy.Error, for errors in PLy_spi_execute_plan.  Do not set
          a Python exception if PyArg_ParseTuple failed, as it already sets

         XLOG_XACT_COMMIT and XLOG_XACT_ABORT WAL records.
