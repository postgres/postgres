 *
 * bgwriter.c
 *
 * The background writer (bgwriter) is new as of Postgres 8.0.	It attempts
 * to keep regular backends from having to write out dirty shared buffers
 * (which they would only do when needing to free a shared buffer to read in
 * another page).  In the best scenario all writes from shared buffers will
 * be issued by the background writer process.	However, regular backends are
 * still empowered to issue writes if the bgwriter fails to maintain enough
 * clean shared buffers.
 *
 * As of Postgres 9.2 the bgwriter no longer handles checkpoints.
 *
 * The bgwriter is started by the postmaster as soon as the startup subprocess
 * finishes, or as soon as recovery begins if we are doing archive recovery.
 * It remains alive until the postmaster commands it to terminate.
 * Normal termination is by SIGUSR2, which instructs the bgwriter to exit(0).
 * Emergency termination is by SIGQUIT; like any
 * backend, the bgwriter will simply abort and exit on SIGQUIT.
 *
 * If the bgwriter exits unexpectedly, the postmaster treats that the same
 * as a backend crash: shared memory may be corrupted, so remaining backends
 * should be killed by SIGQUIT and then a recovery cycle started.  (Even if
 * shared memory isn't corrupted, we have lost information about which
 * files need to be fsync'd for the next checkpoint, and so a system
 * restart needs to be forced.)
