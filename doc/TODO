A dash(-) marks changes that will appear in the upcoming 7.1 release.

Names in brackets "[]" indicate more detailed information is available in
the directory pgsql/doc/TODO.detail/ under that name.


RELIABILITY
-----------

PARSER

* SELECT pg_class FROM pg_class generates strange error
* Alter TABLE ADD COLUMN does not honor DEFAULT, add CONSTRAINT
* -Creating index of TIMESTAMP & RELTIME fails, or rename to DATETIME(Thomas)
* SELECT foo UNION SELECT foo is incorrectly simplified to SELECT foo
* Unique index on base column not honored on inserts from inherited table
  INSERT INTO inherit_table (unique_index_col) VALUES (dup) should fail
  [inherit] 
* Be smarter about promoting types when UNION merges different data types
* redesign INSERT ... SELECT to have two levels of target list
* have INTERSECT/EXCEPT prevent duplicates unless ALL is specified
* SELECT col::DECIMAL(12,10); fails

VIEWS

* Views containing aggregates sometimes fail(Jan)
* Creating view and inheriting the view causes view* to show
  duplicates(inherit) 
* -Disallow LOCK on view(Mark Hollomon)

MISC

* Plpgsql does not handle quoted mixed-case identifiers
* Buffer reference counting bugfixes
* Fix libpq bug that causes it to drop backend error message sent
  just before connection closure (ie, any FATAL error message)
* SELECT ... UNION ... ORDER BY fails when sort expr not in result list
* SELECT ... UNION ... GROUP BY fails if column types disagree, no type
  promotion occurs
* Modification  of  pg_class  can  happen while table in use by
  another backend.  Might  lead  to  MVCC  inside  of  syscache
* Permission to DELETE table allows UPDATE also

  [subquery]
* use fmgr_info()/fmgr_faddr() instead of fmgr() calls in high-traffic
