Regression tests for authentication
===================================

This directory contains a test suite for authentication. SSL certificate
authentication tests are kept separate, in src/test/ssl/, because they
are more complicated, and are not safe to run in a multi-user system.


Running the tests
=================

    make check

NOTE: This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.
