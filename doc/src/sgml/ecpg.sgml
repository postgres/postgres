   <title>Why Embedded <acronym>SQL</acronym>?</title>

   <para>
    Embedded <acronym>SQL</acronym> has some small advantages over other ways 
    to handle <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    queries. It takes care of all the tedious moving of information to and
    from variables in your <acronym>C</acronym> program. 
    Many <acronym>RDBMS</acronym> packages
    support this embedded language.
   </para>

   <para> There is an ANSI-standard describing how the embedded language should
    work. <application>ecpg</application> was designed to meet this standard 
    as much as possible. So it is
    possible to port programs with embedded <acronym>SQL</acronym> written for
    other <acronym>RDBMS</acronym> packages to
    <productname>Postgres</productname> and thus promoting the spirit of free
    software.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>The Concept</title>

   <para>
    You write your program in <acronym>C</acronym> with some 
    special <acronym>SQL</acronym> things.
    For declaring variables that can be used in 
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements you need to
    put them in a special declare section.
    You use a special syntax for the <acronym>SQL</acronym> queries.
   </para>

   <para>
    Before compiling you run the file through 
    the embedded <acronym>SQL</acronym> <acronym>C</acronym>
    preprocessor and it converts the <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements you used 
    to function
    calls with the variables used as arguments. Both variables that are used
    as input to the <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements and variables that will 
    contain the
    result are passed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Then you compile and at link time you link with a special library that
    contains the functions used. These functions (actually it is mostly one
    single function) fetches the information from the arguments, performs
    the <acronym>SQL</acronym> query using the ordinary interface 
    (<filename>libpq</filename>) and puts back
    the result in the arguments dedicated for output.
   </para>

   <para>
    Then you run your program and when the control arrives to 
    the <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    statement the <acronym>SQL</acronym> statement is performed against 
    the database and you
    can continue with the result.
   </para>

   <title>How To Use <application>ecpg</application></title>

   <para>
    This section describes how to use the <application>ecpg</application> tool.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Preprocessor</title>

    <para>
     The preprocessor is called <application>ecpg</application>. 
     After installation it resides in
     the <productname>Postgres</productname> <filename>bin/</filename> directory. 
    </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>Library</title>

    <para>
     The <application>ecpg</application> library is called 
     <filename>libecpg.a</filename> or
     <filename>libecpg.so</filename>. Additionally, the library
     uses the <filename>libpq</filename> library for communication to the 
     <productname>Postgres</productname> server so you will
     have to link your program with <parameter>-lecpg -lpq</parameter>.
    </para>

    <para>
     The library has some methods that are "hidden" but that could prove very
     useful sometime.

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	<function>ECPGdebug(int <replaceable>on</replaceable>, FILE
	 *<replaceable>stream</replaceable>)</function>
	turns on debug logging if called with the first argument non-zero.
	Debug logging is done on <replaceable>stream</replaceable>.
	Most <acronym>SQL</acronym> statement logs its arguments and result.
       </para>

       <para>
	The most important one (<function>ECPGdo</function>) 
	that is called on almost all <acronym>SQL</acronym>
	statements logs both its expanded string,
	i.e. the string
	with all the input variables inserted, and the result from the
	<productname>Postgres</productname> server.
	This can be very useful when searching for errors
	in your <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	<function>ECPGstatus()</function>
	This method returns TRUE if we are connected to a database and FALSE if not.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Error handling</title>

    <para>
     To be able to detect errors from the <productname>Postgres</productname> 
     server you include a line like
     <programlisting>
      exec sql include sqlca;
     </programlisting>
     in the include section of your file. This will define a struct and a
     variable with the name <parameter>sqlca</parameter> as following:
     <programlisting>
struct sqlca
{
 char sqlcaid[8];
 long sqlabc;
 long sqlcode;
 struct
 {
  int sqlerrml;
  char sqlerrmc[70];
 } sqlerrm;
 char sqlerrp[8];
 long sqlerrd[6];
 /* 0: empty                                         */
 /* 1: OID of processed tuple if applicable          */
 /* 2: number of rows processed in an INSERT, UPDATE */
 /*    or DELETE statement                           */
 /* 3: empty                                         */
 /* 4: empty                                         */
 /* 5: empty                                         */
 char sqlwarn[8];
 /* 0: set to 'W' if at least one other is 'W'       */
 /* 1: if 'W' at least one character string	     */
 /*    value was truncated when it was               */
 /*    stored into a host variable.                  */
 /* 2: empty                                         */
 /* 3: empty                                         */
 /* 4: empty                                         */
 /* 5: empty                                         */
 /* 6: empty                                         */
 /* 7: empty                                         */
 char sqlext[8];
} sqlca;
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     If an error occured in the last <acronym>SQL</acronym> statement 
     then <parameter>sqlca.sqlcode</parameter>
     will be non-zero. If <parameter>sqlca.sqlcode</parameter> is less that 0
     then this is
     some kind of serious error, like the database definition does not match
     the query given. If it is bigger than 0 then this is a normal error like
     the table did not contain the requested row.
    </para>

    <para>
     sqlca.sqlerrm.sqlerrmc will contain a string that describes the error.
     The string ends with the line number
     in the source file.

      <term>Oracle's single tasking possibility</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Oracle version 7.0 on AIX 3 uses the OS-supported locks on the shared
	memory segments and allows the application designer to link an
	application in a so called single tasking way. Instead of starting one
	client process per application process both the database part and the
	application part is run in the same process. In later versions of Oracle
	this is no longer supported.
       </para>

       <para>
	This would require a total redesign of the
	<productname>Postgres</productname> access model and
	that effort can not justify the performance gained.

   <title>Porting From Other <acronym>RDBMS</acronym> Packages</title>

   <para>
    The design of <application>ecpg</application> follows SQL standard. So
    porting from a standard RDBMS should not be a problem. Unfortunately there
    is no such thing as a standard RDBMS. So <application>ecpg</application>
    also tries to understand syntax additions as long as they do not create
    conflicts with the standard. 
   </para>

   <para>
    The following list shows all the known incompatibilities. If you find one
    not listed please notify <ulink url="">Michael
     Meskes</ulink>. Note, however, that we list only incompatibilities from
    a precompiler of another RDBMS to <application>ecpg</application> and not
    additional <application>ecpg</application> features that these RDBMS do not
    have.

    on How to use it should be enough for all normal questions.

    <title>The Preprocessor</title>

    <para>
     The first four lines written to the output are constant additions by ecpg.
     These are two comments and two include lines necessary for the interface to the
     library.
    </para>

    <para>
     Then the preprocessor works in one pass only, reading the input file and
     writing to the output as it goes along. Normally it just echoes
     everything to the output without looking at it further.

    <para>
     When it comes to an <command>EXEC SQL</command> statements it intervenes and

	 Declare sections begins with

exec sql begin declare section;

	 and ends with
	 <programlisting>
exec sql end declare section;
	 </programlisting>
	 In the section only variable declarations are allowed. Every variable
	 declare within this section is also entered in a list of variables
	 indexed on their name together with the corresponding type.
	</para>

	<para>
	 In particular the definition of a structure or union also has to be listed
	 inside a declare section. Otherwise <application>ecpg</application> cannot
	 handle these types since it simply does not know the definition.
	</para>

	<para>
	 The declaration is echoed to the file to make the variable a normal
	 C-variable also.
	</para>

	<para>
	 The special types VARCHAR and VARCHAR2 are converted into a named struct
	 for every variable. A declaration like:
	 <programlisting>
VARCHAR var[180];

struct varchar_var { int len; char arr[180]; } var;

	</para>

	<para>
	 Variable substitution occur when a symbol starts with a colon
	 (<command>:</command>). Then a variable with that name is looked for among
	 the variables that were previously declared within a declare section and
	 depending on the variable being for input or output the pointers to the
	 variables are written to the output to allow for access by the function.
	</para>

	<para>
	 For every variable that is part of the <acronym>SQL</acronym> request 
	 the function gets another ten arguments:

	 <simplelist>
	  <member>The type as a special symbol.</member>
	  <member>A pointer to the value or a pointer to the pointer.</member>
	  <member>The size of the variable if it is a char or varchar.</member>

	  <member>The offset to the next element in the array (for array fetches)</member>
	  <member>The type of the indicator variable as a special symbol.</member>

    <title>A Complete Example</title>

    <para>
     Here is a complete example describing the output of the preprocessor of a
     file foo.pgc:
     <programlisting>
exec sql begin declare section;
int index;
int result;
exec sql end declare section;
...
exec sql select res into :result from mytable where index = :index;
     </programlisting>
     is translated into:
     <programlisting>
/* Processed by ecpg (2.6.0) */
/* These two include files are added by the preprocessor */
#include &lt;ecpgtype.h&gt;;
#include &lt;ecpglib.h&gt;;

/* exec sql begin declare section */

#line 1 "foo.pgc"

 int index;
 int result;
/* exec sql end declare section */
...
ECPGdo(__LINE__, NULL, "select  res  from mytable where index = ?     ",
	ECPGt_int,&amp;(index),1L,1L,sizeof(int),
        ECPGt_NO_INDICATOR, NULL , 0L, 0L, 0L, ECPGt_EOIT,

#line 147 "foo.pgc"

    <title>The Library</title>

    <para>
     The most important function in the library is the <function>ECPGdo</function>
     function. It takes a variable amount of arguments. Hopefully we will not run
     into machines with limits on the amount of variables that can be
     accepted by a vararg function. This could easily add up to 50 or so
     arguments.
    </para>

    <para>
     The arguments are:

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>A line number</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 This is a line number for the original line used in error messages only.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>A string</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 This is the <acronym>SQL</acronym> request that is to be issued. 
	 This request is modified
	 by the input variables, i.e. the variables that where not known at
	 compile time but are to be entered in the request. Where the variables
	 should go the string contains <quote>;</quote>.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Input variables</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 As described in the section about the preprocessor every input variable
	 gets ten arguments.

      <varlistentry>
       <term>ECPGt_EOIT</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 An enum telling that there are no more input variables.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Output variables</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 As described in the section about the preprocessor every input variable

      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
     All the <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements are performed in one transaction
     unless you issue a commit transaction. To get this auto-transaction going
     the first statement or the first after statement after a commit or rollback
     always begins a transaction. To disable this feature per default use the
     <option>-t</option> option on the commandline.
    </para>
