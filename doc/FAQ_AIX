On AIX 4.3.2 PostgreSQL compiled with the native IBM compiler xlc
(vac.C 5.0.1) passes all regression tests.  Other versions of OS and
compiler should also work. If you don't have a powerpc or use gcc you
might see rounding differences in the geometry regression test.

Use the following configure flags in addition to your own
if you have readline or libz there:
--with-includes=/usr/local/include --with-libraries=/usr/local/lib

There will probably be warnings about 0.0/0.0 division and duplicate
symbols which you can safely ignore.

Compiling PostgreSQL with gcc (2.95.3) on AIX also works.

You need libm.a that is in the fileset bos.adt.libm.  (Try the
following command.)
$ lslpp -l bos.adt.libm
