SSL regression tests
====================

This directory contains a test suite for SSL support. It tests both
client-side functionality, i.e. verifying server certificates, and
server-side functionality, i.e. certificate authorization.

CAUTION: The test server run by this test is configured to listen for
TCP connections on localhost. Any user on the same host is able to
log in to the test server while the tests are running. Do not run this
suite on a multi-user system where you don't trust all local users!

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster that is accessible to other local users!

Certificates
============

The test suite needs a set of public/private key pairs and certificates to
run:

root_ca
	root CA, use to sign the server and client CA certificates.

server_ca
	CA used to sign server certificates.

client_ca
	CA used to sign client certificates.

server-cn-only
server-cn-and-alt-names
server-single-alt-name
server-multiple-alt-names
server-no-names
	server certificates, with small variations in the hostnames present
        in the certificate. Signed by server_ca.

server-ss
	same as server-cn-only, but self-signed.

server-password
	same as server-cn-only, but password-protected.

client
	a client certificate, for user "ssltestuser". Signed by client_ca.

client-revoked
	like "client", but marked as revoked in the client CA's CRL.

In addition, there are a few files that combine various certificates together
in the same file:

both-cas-1
	Contains root_ca.crt, client_ca.crt and server_ca.crt, in that order.

both-cas-2
	Contains root_ca.crt, server_ca.crt and client_ca.crt, in that order.

root+server_ca
	Contains root_crt and server_ca.crt. For use as client's "sslrootcert"
	option.

root+client_ca
	Contains root_crt and client_ca.crt. For use as server's "ssl_ca_file".

client+client_ca
	Contains client.crt and client_ca.crt in that order. For use as client's
	certificate chain.

There are also CRLs for each of the CAs: root.crl, server.crl and client.crl.

For convenience, all of these keypairs and certificates are included in the
ssl/ subdirectory. The Makefile also contains a rule, "make sslfiles", to
recreate them if you need to make changes.

TODO
====

* Allow the client-side of the tests to be run on different host easily.
  Currently, you have to manually set up the certificates for the right
  hostname, and modify the test file to skip setting up the server. And you
  have to modify the server to accept connections from the client host.

* Test having multiple server certificates, so that the private key chooses
  the certificate to present to clients. (And the same in the client-side.)
