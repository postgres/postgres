   <para>
      This chapter describes the settings available in
      <filename>recovery.conf</> file. They apply only for the duration of
      the recovery.  (A sample file, <filename>share/recovery.conf.sample</>,
      exists in the installation's <filename>share/</> directory.)  They must
      be reset for any subsequent recovery you wish to perform. They cannot
      be changed once recovery has begun.

        The shell command to execute to retrieve an archived segment of
        the WAL file series. This parameter is required for archive recovery,
        but optional for streaming replication.
        Any <literal>%f</> in the string is
        replaced by the name of the file to retrieve from the archive,
        and any <literal>%p</> is replaced by the copy destination path name
        on the server.
        (The path name is relative to the current working directory,
        i.e., the cluster's data directory.)
        Any <literal>%r</> is replaced by the name of the file containing the
        last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that must be kept
        to allow a restore to be restartable, so this information can be used
        to truncate the archive to just the minimum required to support
        restarting from the current restore. <literal>%r</> is typically only
        used by warm-standby configurations
        (see <xref linkend="warm-standby">).
        Write <literal>%%</> to embed an actual <literal>%</> character.
       </para>

       <para>
        It is important for the command to return a zero exit status
        only if it succeeds.  The command <emphasis>will</> be asked for file
        names that are not present in the archive; it must return nonzero
        when so asked.  Examples:
<programlisting>
restore_command = 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f "%p"'
restore_command = 'copy "C:\\server\\archivedir\\%f" "%p"'  # Windows
</programlisting>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This parameter specifies a shell command that will be executed once only
        at the end of recovery. This parameter is optional. The purpose of the
        <varname>recovery_end_command</> is to provide a mechanism for cleanup
        following replication or recovery.
        Any <literal>%r</> is replaced by the name of the file
        containing the last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that
        must be kept to allow a restore to be restartable, so this information
        can be used to truncate the archive to just the minimum required to
        support restart from the current restore. <literal>%r</> would
        typically be used in a warm-standby configuration
        (see <xref linkend="warm-standby">).
        Write <literal>%%</> to embed an actual <literal>%</> character
        in the command.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the command returns a non-zero exit status then a WARNING log
        message will be written and the database will proceed to start up
        anyway.  An exception is that if the command was terminated by a
        signal, the database will not proceed with startup.

        This parameter specifies the time stamp up to which recovery
        will proceed.
        At most one of <varname>recovery_target_time</> and
        <xref linkend="recovery-target-xid"> can be specified.

       <para>
        This parameter specifies the transaction ID up to which recovery
        will proceed. Keep in mind
        that while transaction IDs are assigned sequentially at transaction
        start, transactions can complete in a different numeric order.
        The transactions that will be recovered are those that committed
        before (and optionally including) the specified one.
        At most one of <varname>recovery_target_xid</> and
        <xref linkend="recovery-target-time"> can be specified.
        The default is to recover to the end of the WAL log.
        The precise stopping point is also influenced by

        Specifies whether we stop just after the specified recovery target
        (<literal>true</literal>), or just before the recovery target
        (<literal>false</literal>).
        Applies to both <xref linkend="recovery-target-time">
        and <xref linkend="recovery-target-xid">, whichever one is
        specified for this recovery.  This indicates whether transactions
        having exactly the target commit time or ID, respectively, will
        be included in the recovery.  Default is <literal>true</>.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Specifies recovering into a particular timeline.  The default is
        to recover along the same timeline that was current when the
        base backup was taken.  You only need to set this parameter
        in complex re-recovery situations, where you need to return to
        a state that itself was reached after a point-in-time recovery.

          a standby. If this parameter is <literal>on</>, the server will
          not end recovery when the end of archived WAL is reached, but
          will keep trying to continue recovery using <varname>restore_command</>
          and by connecting to the primary server as specified by the

         <para>
          Specifies a connection string to be used for the standby server
          to connect with the primary. This string is in the same format as
          described in <xref linkend="libpq-connect">. If any option is
          unspecified in this string, then the corresponding environment
          variable (see <xref linkend="libpq-envars">) is checked. If the
          environment variable is not set either, then
          defaults are used.
         </para>
         <para>
          The built-in replication requires that a host name (or host address)
          or port number which the primary server listens on be
          specified in this string. Also ensure that a role with
          the <literal>SUPERUSER</> and <literal>LOGIN</> privileges on the
          primary is set (see
          <xref linkend="streaming-replication-authentication">). Note that
          the password needs to be set if the primary demands password
          authentication.

          This setting has no effect if <varname>standby_mode</> is <literal>off</>.

          Specifies a trigger file whose presence ends recovery in the
          standby. If no trigger file is specified, the standby never exits
          recovery.
          This setting has no effect if <varname>standby_mode</> is <literal>off</>.
