 *
 * nodeAgg.c
 *	  Routines to handle aggregate nodes.
 *
 *	  ExecAgg normally evaluates each aggregate in the following steps:
 *
 *		 transvalue = initcond
 *		 foreach input_tuple do
 *			transvalue = transfunc(transvalue, input_value(s))
 *		 result = finalfunc(transvalue, direct_argument(s))
 *
 *	  If a finalfunc is not supplied then the result is just the ending
 *	  value of transvalue.
 *
 *	  Other behaviors can be selected by the "aggsplit" mode, which exists
 *	  to support partial aggregation.  It is possible to:
 *	  * Skip running the finalfunc, so that the output is always the
 *	  final transvalue state.
 *	  * Substitute the combinefunc for the transfunc, so that transvalue
 *	  states (propagated up from a child partial-aggregation step) are merged
 *	  rather than processing raw input rows.  (The statements below about
 *	  the transfunc apply equally to the combinefunc, when it's selected.)
 *	  * Apply the serializefunc to the output values (this only makes sense
 *	  when skipping the finalfunc, since the serializefunc works on the
 *	  transvalue data type).
 *	  * Apply the deserializefunc to the input values (this only makes sense
 *	  when using the combinefunc, for similar reasons).
 *	  It is the planner's responsibility to connect up Agg nodes using these
 *	  alternate behaviors in a way that makes sense, with partial aggregation
 *	  results being fed to nodes that expect them.
 *
 *	  If a normal aggregate call specifies DISTINCT or ORDER BY, we sort the
 *	  input tuples and eliminate duplicates (if required) before performing
 *	  the above-depicted process.  (However, we don't do that for ordered-set
 *	  aggregates; their "ORDER BY" inputs are ordinary aggregate arguments
 *	  so far as this module is concerned.)	Note that partial aggregation
 *	  is not supported in these cases, since we couldn't ensure global
 *	  ordering or distinctness of the inputs.
 *
 *	  If transfunc is marked "strict" in pg_proc and initcond is NULL,
 *	  then the first non-NULL input_value is assigned directly to transvalue,
 *	  and transfunc isn't applied until the second non-NULL input_value.
 *	  The agg's first input type and transtype must be the same in this case!
 *
 *	  If transfunc is marked "strict" then NULL input_values are skipped,
 *	  keeping the previous transvalue.  If transfunc is not strict then it
 *	  is called for every input tuple and must deal with NULL initcond
 *	  or NULL input_values for itself.
 *
 *	  If finalfunc is marked "strict" then it is not called when the
 *	  ending transvalue is NULL, instead a NULL result is created
 *	  automatically (this is just the usual handling of strict functions,
 *	  of course).  A non-strict finalfunc can make its own choice of
 *	  what to return for a NULL ending transvalue.
 *
 *	  Ordered-set aggregates are treated specially in one other way: we
 *	  evaluate any "direct" arguments and pass them to the finalfunc along
 *	  with the transition value.
 *
 *	  A finalfunc can have additional arguments beyond the transvalue and
 *	  any "direct" arguments, corresponding to the input arguments of the
 *	  aggregate.  These are always just passed as NULL.  Such arguments may be
 *	  needed to allow resolution of a polymorphic aggregate's result type.
 *
 *	  We compute aggregate input expressions and run the transition functions
 *	  in a temporary econtext (aggstate->tmpcontext).  This is reset at least
 *	  once per input tuple, so when the transvalue datatype is
 *	  pass-by-reference, we have to be careful to copy it into a longer-lived
 *	  memory context, and free the prior value to avoid memory leakage.  We
 *	  store transvalues in another set of econtexts, aggstate->aggcontexts
 *	  (one per grouping set, see below), which are also used for the hashtable
 *	  structures in AGG_HASHED mode.  These econtexts are rescanned, not just
 *	  reset, at group boundaries so that aggregate transition functions can
 *	  register shutdown callbacks via AggRegisterCallback.
 *
 *	  The node's regular econtext (aggstate->ss.ps.ps_ExprContext) is used to
 *	  run finalize functions and compute the output tuple; this context can be
 *	  reset once per output tuple.
 *
 *	  The executor's AggState node is passed as the fmgr "context" value in
 *	  all transfunc and finalfunc calls.  It is not recommended that the
 *	  transition functions look at the AggState node directly, but they can
 *	  use AggCheckCallContext() to verify that they are being called by
 *	  nodeAgg.c (and not as ordinary SQL functions).  The main reason a
 *	  transition function might want to know this is so that it can avoid
 *	  palloc'ing a fixed-size pass-by-ref transition value on every call:
 *	  it can instead just scribble on and return its left input.  Ordinarily
 *	  it is completely forbidden for functions to modify pass-by-ref inputs,
 *	  but in the aggregate case we know the left input is either the initial
 *	  transition value or a previous function result, and in either case its
 *	  value need not be preserved.  See int8inc() for an example.  Notice that
 *	  the EEOP_AGG_PLAIN_TRANS step is coded to avoid a data copy step when
 *	  the previous transition value pointer is returned.  It is also possible
 *	  to avoid repeated data copying when the transition value is an expanded
 *	  object: to do that, the transition function must take care to return
 *	  an expanded object that is in a child context of the memory context
 *	  returned by AggCheckCallContext().  Also, some transition functions want
 *	  to store working state in addition to the nominal transition value; they
 *	  can use the memory context returned by AggCheckCallContext() to do that.
 *
 *	  Note: AggCheckCallContext() is available as of PostgreSQL 9.0.  The
 *	  AggState is available as context in earlier releases (back to 8.1),
 *	  but direct examination of the node is needed to use it before 9.0.
 *
 *	  As of 9.4, aggregate transition functions can also use AggGetAggref()
 *	  to get hold of the Aggref expression node for their aggregate call.
 *	  This is mainly intended for ordered-set aggregates, which are not
 *	  supported as window functions.  (A regular aggregate function would
 *	  need some fallback logic to use this, since there's no Aggref node
 *	  for a window function.)
 *
 *	  Grouping sets:
 *
 *	  A list of grouping sets which is structurally equivalent to a ROLLUP
 *	  clause (e.g. (a,b,c), (a,b), (a)) can be processed in a single pass over
 *	  ordered data.  We do this by keeping a separate set of transition values
 *	  for each grouping set being concurrently processed; for each input tuple
 *	  we update them all, and on group boundaries we reset those states
 *	  (starting at the front of the list) whose grouping values have changed
 *	  (the list of grouping sets is ordered from most specific to least
 *	  specific).
 *
 *	  Where more complex grouping sets are used, we break them down into
 *	  "phases", where each phase has a different sort order (except phase 0
 *	  which is reserved for hashing).  During each phase but the last, the
 *	  input tuples are additionally stored in a tuplesort which is keyed to the
 *	  next phase's sort order; during each phase but the first, the input
 *	  tuples are drawn from the previously sorted data.  (The sorting of the
 *	  data for the first phase is handled by the planner, as it might be
 *	  satisfied by underlying nodes.)
 *
 *	  Hashing can be mixed with sorted grouping.  To do this, we have an
 *	  AGG_MIXED strategy that populates the hashtables during the first sorted
 *	  phase, and switches to reading them out after completing all sort phases.
 *	  We can also support AGG_HASHED with multiple hash tables and no sorting
 *	  at all.
 *
 *	  From the perspective of aggregate transition and final functions, the
 *	  only issue regarding grouping sets is this: a single call site (flinfo)
 *	  of an aggregate function may be used for updating several different
 *	  transition values in turn. So the function must not cache in the flinfo
 *	  anything which logically belongs as part of the transition value (most
 *	  importantly, the memory context in which the transition value exists).
 *	  The support API functions (AggCheckCallContext, AggRegisterCallback) are
 *	  sensitive to the grouping set for which the aggregate function is
 *	  currently being called.
 *
 *	  Plan structure:
 *
 *	  What we get from the planner is actually one "real" Agg node which is
 *	  part of the plan tree proper, but which optionally has an additional list
 *	  of Agg nodes hung off the side via the "chain" field.  This is because an
 *	  Agg node happens to be a convenient representation of all the data we
 *	  need for grouping sets.
 *
 *	  For many purposes, we treat the "real" node as if it were just the first
 *	  node in the chain.  The chain must be ordered such that hashed entries
 *	  come before sorted/plain entries; the real node is marked AGG_MIXED if
 *	  there are both types present (in which case the real node describes one
 *	  of the hashed groupings, other AGG_HASHED nodes may optionally follow in
 *	  the chain, followed in turn by AGG_SORTED or (one) AGG_PLAIN node).  If
 *	  the real node is marked AGG_HASHED or AGG_SORTED, then all the chained
 *	  nodes must be of the same type; if it is AGG_PLAIN, there can be no
 *	  chained nodes.
 *
 *	  We collect all hashed nodes into a single "phase", numbered 0, and create
 *	  a sorted phase (numbered 1..n) for each AGG_SORTED or AGG_PLAIN node.
 *	  Phase 0 is allocated even if there are no hashes, but remains unused in
 *	  that case.
 *
 *	  AGG_HASHED nodes actually refer to only a single grouping set each,
 *	  because for each hashed grouping we need a separate grpColIdx and
 *	  numGroups estimate.  AGG_SORTED nodes represent a "rollup", a list of
 *	  grouping sets that share a sort order.  Each AGG_SORTED node other than
 *	  the first one has an associated Sort node which describes the sort order
 *	  to be used; the first sorted node takes its input from the outer subtree,
 *	  which the planner has already arranged to provide ordered data.
 *
 *	  Memory and ExprContext usage:
 *
 *	  Because we're accumulating aggregate values across input rows, we need to
 *	  use more memory contexts than just simple input/output tuple contexts.
 *	  In fact, for a rollup, we need a separate context for each grouping set
 *	  so that we can reset the inner (finer-grained) aggregates on their group
 *	  boundaries while continuing to accumulate values for outer
 *	  (coarser-grained) groupings.  On top of this, we might be simultaneously
 *	  populating hashtables; however, we only need one context for all the
 *	  hashtables.
 *
 *	  So we create an array, aggcontexts, with an ExprContext for each grouping
 *	  set in the largest rollup that we're going to process, and use the
 *	  per-tuple memory context of those ExprContexts to store the aggregate
 *	  transition values.  hashcontext is the single context created to support
 *	  all hash tables.
 *
 *    Transition / Combine function invocation:
 *
 *    For performance reasons transition functions, including combine
 *    functions, aren't invoked one-by-one from nodeAgg.c after computing
 *    arguments using the expression evaluation engine. Instead
 *    ExecBuildAggTrans() builds one large expression that does both argument
 *    evaluation and transition function invocation. That avoids performance
 *    issues due to repeated uses of expression evaluation, complications due
 *    to filter expressions having to be evaluated early, and allows to JIT
 *    the entire expression into one native function.

	 *
	 * Scenarios:
	 *
	 * 1. Identical aggregate function calls appear in the query:
	 *
	 *	  SELECT SUM(x) FROM ... HAVING SUM(x) > 0
	 *
	 *	  Since these aggregates are identical, we only need to calculate
	 *	  the value once. Both aggregates will share the same 'aggno' value.
	 *
	 * 2. Two different aggregate functions appear in the query, but the
	 *	  aggregates have the same arguments, transition functions and
	 *	  initial values (and, presumably, different final functions):
	 *
	 *	  SELECT AVG(x), STDDEV(x) FROM ...
	 *
	 *	  In this case we must create a new peragg for the varying aggregate,
	 *	  and we need to call the final functions separately, but we need
	 *	  only run the transition function once.  (This requires that the
	 *	  final functions be nondestructive of the transition state, but
	 *	  that's required anyway for other reasons.)
	 *
	 * For either of these optimizations to be valid, all aggregate properties
	 * used in the transition phase must be the same, including any modifiers
	 * such as ORDER BY, DISTINCT and FILTER, and the arguments mustn't
	 * contain any volatile functions.
