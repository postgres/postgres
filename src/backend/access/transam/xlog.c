/*----------
 * Shared-memory data structures for XLOG control
 *
 * LogwrtRqst indicates a byte position that we need to write and/or fsync
 * the log up to (all records before that point must be written or fsynced).
 * LogwrtResult indicates the byte positions we have already written/fsynced.
 * These structs are identical but are declared separately to indicate their
 * slightly different functions.
 *
 * We do a lot of pushups to minimize the amount of access to lockable
 * shared memory values.  There are actually three shared-memory copies of
 * LogwrtResult, plus one unshared copy in each backend.  Here's how it works:
 *		XLogCtl->LogwrtResult is protected by info_lck
 *		XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult is protected by WALWriteLock
 *		XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult is protected by WALInsertLock
 * One must hold the associated lock to read or write any of these, but
 * of course no lock is needed to read/write the unshared LogwrtResult.
 *
 * XLogCtl->LogwrtResult and XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult are both "always
 * right", since both are updated by a write or flush operation before
 * it releases WALWriteLock.  The point of keeping XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult
 * is that it can be examined/modified by code that already holds WALWriteLock
 * without needing to grab info_lck as well.
 *
 * XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult may lag behind the reality of the other two,
 * but is updated when convenient.	Again, it exists for the convenience of
 * code that is already holding WALInsertLock but not the other locks.
 *
 * The unshared LogwrtResult may lag behind any or all of these, and again
 * is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * Note that this all works because the request and result positions can only
 * advance forward, never back up, and so we can easily determine which of two
 * values is "more up to date".
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALInsertLock: must be held to insert a record into the WAL buffers.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.
 *
 * CheckpointLock: must be held to do a checkpoint or restartpoint (ensures
 * only one checkpointer at a time; currently, with all checkpoints done by
 * the bgwriter, this is just pro forma).

 * do_pg_start_backup is the workhorse of the user-visible pg_start_backup()
 * function. It creates the necessary starting checkpoint and constructs the
 * backup label file.
 *
 * There are two kind of backups: exclusive and non-exclusive. An exclusive
 * backup is started with pg_start_backup(), and there can be only one active
 * at a time. The backup label file of an exclusive backup is written to
 * $PGDATA/backup_label, and it is removed by pg_stop_backup().
 *
 * A non-exclusive backup is used for the streaming base backups (see
 * src/backend/replication/basebackup.c). The difference to exclusive backups
 * is that the backup label file is not written to disk. Instead, its would-be
 * contents are returned in *labelfile, and the caller is responsible for
 * including it in the backup archive as 'backup_label'. There can be many
 * non-exclusive backups active at the same time, and they don't conflict
 * with an exclusive backup either.
 *
 * Every successfully started non-exclusive backup must be stopped by calling
 * do_pg_stop_backup() or do_pg_abort_backup().
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the caller of this function to verify the
 * permissions of the calling user!
