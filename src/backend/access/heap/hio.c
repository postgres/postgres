/*
 * RelationGetBufferForTuple
 *
 *	Returns pinned and exclusive-locked buffer of a page in given relation
 *	with free space >= given len.
 *
 *	If otherBuffer is not InvalidBuffer, then it references a previously
 *	pinned buffer of another page in the same relation; on return, this
 *	buffer will also be exclusive-locked.  (This case is used by heap_update;
 *	the otherBuffer contains the tuple being updated.)
 *
 *	The reason for passing otherBuffer is that if two backends are doing
 *	concurrent heap_update operations, a deadlock could occur if they try
 *	to lock the same two buffers in opposite orders.  To ensure that this
 *	can't happen, we impose the rule that buffers of a relation must be
 *	locked in increasing page number order.  This is most conveniently done
 *	by having RelationGetBufferForTuple lock them both, with suitable care
 *	for ordering.
 *
 *	NOTE: it is unlikely, but not quite impossible, for otherBuffer to be the
 *	same buffer we select for insertion of the new tuple (this could only
 *	happen if space is freed in that page after heap_update finds there's not
 *	enough there).  In that case, the page will be pinned and locked only once.
 *
 *	We normally use FSM to help us find free space.  However,
 *	if HEAP_INSERT_SKIP_FSM is specified, we just append a new empty page to
 *	the end of the relation if the tuple won't fit on the current target page.
 *	This can save some cycles when we know the relation is new and doesn't
 *	contain useful amounts of free space.
 *
 *	HEAP_INSERT_SKIP_FSM is also useful for non-WAL-logged additions to a
 *	relation, if the caller holds exclusive lock and is careful to invalidate
 *	relation's smgr_targblock before the first insertion --- that ensures that
 *	all insertions will occur into newly added pages and not be intermixed
 *	with tuples from other transactions.  That way, a crash can't risk losing
 *	any committed data of other transactions.  (See heap_insert's comments
 *	for additional constraints needed for safe usage of this behavior.)
 *
 *	The caller can also provide a BulkInsertState object to optimize many
 *	insertions into the same relation.  This keeps a pin on the current
 *	insertion target page (to save pin/unpin cycles) and also passes a
 *	BULKWRITE buffer selection strategy object to the buffer manager.
 *	Passing NULL for bistate selects the default behavior.
 *
 *	We always try to avoid filling existing pages further than the fillfactor.
 *	This is OK since this routine is not consulted when updating a tuple and
 *	keeping it on the same page, which is the scenario fillfactor is meant
 *	to reserve space for.
 *
 *	ereport(ERROR) is allowed here, so this routine *must* be called
 *	before any (unlogged) changes are made in buffer pool.
