Regression tests for data checksums
===================================

This directory contains a test suite for enabling data checksums
in a running cluster with streaming replication.

Running the tests
=================

    make check

or

    make installcheck

NOTE: This creates a temporary installation (in the case of "check"),
with multiple nodes, be they master or standby(s) for the purpose of
the tests.

NOTE: This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.
