  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <application>postmaster</application> is the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> multi-user database server.
   In order for a client application to access a database it connects
   (over a network or locally) to a running
   <application>postmaster</application>.  The
   <application>postmaster</application> then starts a separate server
   process (<quote><xref linkend="app-postgres"
   endterm="app-postgres-title"></quote>) to handle the connection.
   The postmaster also manages the communication among server
   processes.
  </para>

  <para>
   By default the postmaster starts in the foreground and prints log
   messages to the standard output.  In practical applications the
   postmaster should be started as a background process, perhaps at
   boot time.
  </para>

  <para>
   One postmaster always manages the data from exactly one database
   cluster.  A database cluster is a collection of databases that is
   stored at a common file system location.  When the postmaster
   starts it needs to know the location of the database cluster files
   (<quote>data area</quote>).  This is done with the
   <option>-D</option> invocation option or the <envar>PGDATA</envar>
   environment variable, there is no default.  More than one
   postmaster process can run on a system at one time, as long as they
   use different data areas and different port numbers (see below).  A
   data area is created with <xref linkend="app-initdb"
   endterm="app-initdb-title">.
  </para>

  <refsect2 id="app-postmaster-options">
   <title>Options</title>
   <para>
    <application>postmaster</application> accepts the following
    command line arguments.  For a detailed discussion of the options
    consult the <citetitle>Administrator's Guide</citetitle>.  You can
    also save typing most of these options by setting up a
    configuration file.

        Enables run-time assert checks, which is a debugging aid to

        Sets a named run-time parameter. Consult the

        descriptions.  Most of the other command line options are in
        fact short forms of such a parameter assignment.

       <para>
        On some systems it is also possible to equivalently use

        Sets the debug level.  The higher this value is set, the more
        debugging output is written to the server log.  The default is
        0, which means no debugging.  Values up to 4 make sense.

	Defaults to the value of the <envar>PGPORT</envar> environment
	variable, or if <envar>PGPORT</envar> is not set, then
	defaults to the value established during compilation (normally
	5432).  If you specify a port other than the default port,

       <para>
	Specifies that the <application>postmaster</application>

	disassociate from the user's (controlling) terminal, start its
	own process group, and redirect its standard output and
	standard error to <filename>/dev/null</filename>.
       </para>
       <para>
        Using this switch discards all logging output, which is

   <para>
    Two additional command line options are available for debugging
    problems that cause a backend to die abnormally.  These options
    control the behavior of the <application>postmaster</application>
    in this situation, and <emphasis>neither option is intended for
    use in ordinary operation</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The ordinary strategy for this situation is to notify all other
    backends that they must terminate and then reinitialize the shared
    memory and semaphores.  This is because an errant backend could
    have corrupted some shared state before terminating.

	<application>postmaster</application>
	and immediately restart it using the same port; in this case, you must
	simply wait a few seconds until the operating system closes the port
	before trying again.  Finally, you may get this error if you specify
	a port number that your operating system considers to be reserved.
	For example, many versions of Unix consider port numbers under 1024 to
	be <firstterm>trusted</firstterm>

	A likely explanation is that another user attempted to start a

	and try again.  If other <application>postmaster</application>

  <para>
   To terminate the postmaster normally, the signals

   <literal>SIGQUIT</literal> can be used.  The first will wait for
