Parser
======

This directory does more than tokenize and parse SQL queries.  It also
creates Query structures for the various complex queries that are passed
to the optimizer and then executor.

parser.c	things start here
scan.l		break query into tokens
scansup.c	handle escapes in input strings
gram.y		parse the tokens and produce a "raw" parse tree
analyze.c	top level of parse analysis for optimizable queries
parse_agg.c	handle aggregates, like SUM(col1),  AVG(col2), ...
parse_clause.c	handle clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, ...
parse_coerce.c	handle coercing expressions to different data types
parse_collate.c	assign collation information in completed expressions
parse_cte.c	handle Common Table Expressions (WITH clauses)
parse_expr.c	handle expressions like col, col + 3, x = 3 or x = 4
parse_func.c	handle functions, table.column and column identifiers
parse_node.c	create nodes for various structures
parse_oper.c	handle operators in expressions
parse_param.c	handle Params (for the cases used in the core backend)
parse_relation.c support routines for tables and column handling
parse_target.c	handle the result list of the query
parse_type.c	support routines for data type handling
parse_utilcmd.c	parse analysis for utility commands (done at execution time)

See also src/common/keywords.c, which contains the table of standard
keywords and the keyword lookup function.  We separated that out because
various frontend code wants to use it too.
