 <para>
  When a client application connects to the database server, it
  specifies which <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database user name it
  wants to connect as, much the same way one logs into a Unix computer
  as a particular user. Within the SQL environment the active database
  user name determines access privileges to database objects &mdash; see
  <xref linkend="user-manag"> for more information. Therefore, it is
  essential to restrict which database users can connect.
 </para>

 <note>
  <para>
   As explained in <xref linkend="user-manag">,
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> actually does privilege
   management in terms of <quote>roles</>.  In this chapter, we
   consistently use <firstterm>database user</> to mean <quote>role with the
   <literal>LOGIN</> privilege</quote>.
  </para>
 </note>

 <para>
  <firstterm>Authentication</firstterm> is the process by which the
  database server establishes the identity of the client, and by
  extension determines whether the client application (or the user
  who runs the client application) is permitted to connect with the
  database user name that was requested.
 </para>

 <para>
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> offers a number of different
  client authentication methods. The method used to authenticate a
  particular client connection can be selected on the basis of
  (client) host address, database, and user.
 </para>

 <para>
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database user names are logically
  separate from user names of the operating system in which the server
  runs. If all the users of a particular server also have accounts on
  the server's machine, it makes sense to assign database user names
  that match their operating system user names. However, a server that
  accepts remote connections might have many database users who have no local
  operating system
  account, and in such cases there need be no connection between
  database user names and OS user names.

  <title>The <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> File</title>

  <indexterm zone="auth-pg-hba-conf">
   <primary>pg_hba.conf</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file,
   which traditionally is named
   <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> and is stored in the database
   cluster's data directory.
   (<acronym>HBA</> stands for host-based authentication.) A default
   <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is installed when the data
   directory is initialized by <command>initdb</command>.  It is
   possible to place the authentication configuration file elsewhere,
   however; see the <xref linkend="guc-hba-file"> configuration parameter.
  </para>

  <para>
   The general format of the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <literal>#</literal> comment character.
   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <literal>all</> or <literal>replication</>) makes the word lose its special
   meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <quote>fall-through</> or
   <quote>backup</>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
   access is denied.
  </para>

  <para>
   A record can have one of the seven formats

    <varlistentry>
     <term><replaceable>database</replaceable></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specifies which database name(s) this record matches.  The value
       <literal>all</literal> specifies that it matches all databases.
       The value <literal>sameuser</> specifies that the record
       matches if the requested database has the same name as the
       requested user.  The value <literal>samerole</> specifies that
       the requested user must be a member of the role with the same
       name as the requested database.  (<literal>samegroup</> is an
       obsolete but still accepted spelling of <literal>samerole</>.)
       Superusers are not considered to be members of a role for the
       purposes of <literal>samerole</> unless they are explicitly
       members of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by
       virtue of being a superuser.
       The value <literal>replication</> specifies that the record
       matches if a replication connection is requested (note that
       replication connections do not specify any particular database).
       Otherwise, this is the name of
       a specific <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database.
       Multiple database names can be supplied by separating them with
       commas.  A separate file containing database names can be specified by
       preceding the file name with <literal>@</>.
      </para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><replaceable>user</replaceable></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specifies which database user name(s) this record
       matches. The value <literal>all</literal> specifies that it
       matches all users.  Otherwise, this is either the name of a specific
       database user, or a group name preceded by <literal>+</>.
       (Recall that there is no real distinction between users and groups
       in <productname>PostgreSQL</>; a <literal>+</> mark really means
       <quote>match any of the roles that are directly or indirectly members
       of this role</>, while a name without a <literal>+</> mark matches
       only that specific role.) For this purpose, a superuser is only
       considered to be a member of a role if they are explicitly a member
       of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of
       being a superuser.
       Multiple user names can be supplied by separating them with commas.
       A separate file containing user names can be specified by preceding the
       file name with <literal>@</>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><replaceable>address</replaceable></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record
       matches.  This field can contain either a host name, an IP
       address range, or one of the special key words mentioned below.
      </para>

      <para>
       An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation
       for the range's starting address, then a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
       and a <acronym>CIDR</> mask length.  The mask
       length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
       IP address that must match.  Bits to the right of this should
       be zero in the given IP address.
       There must not be any white space between the IP address, the
       <literal>/</literal>, and the CIDR mask length.
      </para>

      <para>
       Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are
       <literal>172.20.143.89/32</literal> for a single host, or
       <literal>172.20.143.0/24</literal> for a small network, or
       <literal>10.6.0.0/16</literal> for a larger one.
       An IPv6 address range might look like <literal>::1/128</literal>
       for a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or
       <literal>fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</literal> for a small
       network.
       <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> represents all
       IPv4 addresses, and <literal>::0/0</literal> represents
       all IPv6 addresses.
       To specify a single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or
       128 for IPv6.  In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.
      </para>

      <para>
       An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections,
       and an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections,
       even if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.
       Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's
       C library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.
      </para>

      <para>
       You can also write <literal>all</literal> to match any IP address,
       <literal>samehost</literal> to match any of the server's own IP
       addresses, or <literal>samenet</literal> to match any address in any
       subnet that the server is directly connected to.
      </para>

      <para>
       If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address
       range or a special key word is treated as a host name),
       that name is compared with the result of a reverse name
       resolution of the client's IP address (e.g., reverse DNS
       lookup, if DNS is used).  Host name comparisons are case
       insensitive.  If there is a match, then a forward name
       resolution (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host
       name to check whether any of the addresses it resolves to are
       equal to the client's IP address.  If both directions match,
       then the entry is considered to match.  (The host name that is
       used in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> should be the one that
       address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns,
       otherwise the line won't be matched.  Some host name databases
       allow associating an IP address with multiple host names, but
       the operating system will only return one host name when asked
       to resolve an IP address.)
      </para>

      <para>
       A host name specification that starts with a dot
       (<literal>.</literal>) matches a suffix of the actual host
       name.  So <literal>.example.com</literal> would match
       <literal>foo.example.com</literal> (but not just
       <literal>example.com</literal>).
      </para>

      <para>
       When host names are specified
       in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>, you should make sure that
       name resolution is reasonably fast.  It can be of advantage to
       set up a local name resolution cache such
       as <command>nscd</command>.  Also, you may wish to enable the
       configuration parameter <varname>log_hostname</varname> to see
       the client's host name instead of the IP address in the log.
      </para>

      <para>
       This field only applies to <literal>host</literal>,
       <literal>hostssl</literal>, and <literal>hostnossl</> records.
      </para>

      <sidebar>
       <para>
        Users sometimes wonder why host names are handled
        in this seemingly complicated way, with two name resolutions
        including a reverse lookup of the client's IP address.  This
        complicates use of the feature in case the client's reverse DNS
        entry is not set up or yields some undesirable host name.
        It is done primarily for efficiency: this way, a connection attempt
        requires at most two resolver lookups, one reverse and one forward.
        If there is a resolver problem with some address, it becomes only
        that client's problem.  A hypothetical alternative
        implementation that only did forward lookups would have to
        resolve every host name mentioned in
        <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> during every connection attempt.
        That could be quite slow if many names are listed.
        And if there is a resolver problem with one of the host names,
        it becomes everyone's problem.
       </para>

       <para>
        Also, a reverse lookup is necessary to implement the suffix
        matching feature, because the actual client host name needs to
        be known in order to match it against the pattern.
       </para>

       <para>
        Note that this behavior is consistent with other popular
        implementations of host name-based access control, such as the
        Apache HTTP Server and TCP Wrappers.

       notation.  Instead of
       specifying the mask length, the actual mask is specified in a
       separate column. For example, <literal>255.0.0.0</> represents an IPv4
       CIDR mask length of 8, and <literal>255.255.255.255</> represents a
       CIDR mask length of 32.

   Files included by <literal>@</> constructs are read as lists of names,
   which can be separated by either whitespace or commas.  Comments are
   introduced by <literal>#</literal>, just as in
   <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>, and nested <literal>@</> constructs are
   allowed.  Unless the file name following <literal>@</> is an absolute
   path, it is taken to be relative to the directory containing the
   referencing file.
  </para>

  <para>
   Since the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is
   significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection
   match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later
   records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication
   methods. For example, one might wish to use <literal>trust</>
   authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for
   remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying
   <literal>trust</> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.

   The <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is read on start-up and when
   the main server process receives a

   signal. If you edit the file on an
   active system, you will need to signal the postmaster
   (using <literal>pg_ctl reload</> or <literal>kill -HUP</>) to make it
   re-read the file.
  </para>

   <para>
    To connect to a particular database, a user must not only pass the
    <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> checks, but must have the
    <literal>CONNECT</> privilege for the database.  If you wish to
    restrict which users can connect to which databases, it's usually
    easier to control this by granting/revoking <literal>CONNECT</> privilege
    than to put the rules in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> entries.

  <title>User Name Maps</title>

   <primary>User name maps</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   When using an external authentication system such as Ident or GSSAPI,
   the name of the operating system user that initiated the connection
   might not be the same as the database user that is to be connect as.
   In this case, a user name map can be applied to map the operating system
   user name to a database user.  To use user name mapping, specify
   <literal>map</literal>=<replaceable>map-name</replaceable>
   in the options field in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>. This option is
   supported for all authentication methods that receive external user names.
   Since different mappings might be needed for different connections,
   the name of the map to be used is specified in the
   <replaceable>map-name</replaceable> parameter in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
   to indicate which map to use for each individual connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   User name maps are defined in the ident map file, which by default is named
   <filename>pg_ident.conf</><indexterm><primary>pg_ident.conf</primary></indexterm>
   and is stored in the
   cluster's data directory.  (It is possible to place the map file
   elsewhere, however; see the <xref linkend="guc-ident-file">
   configuration parameter.)
   The ident map file contains lines of the general form:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>map-name</> <replaceable>system-username</> <replaceable>database-username</>
</synopsis>
   Comments and whitespace are handled in the same way as in
   <filename>pg_hba.conf</>.  The
   <replaceable>map-name</> is an arbitrary name that will be used to
   refer to this mapping in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>. The other
   two fields specify an operating system user name and a matching
   database user name. The same <replaceable>map-name</> can be
   used repeatedly to specify multiple user-mappings within a single map.
  </para>
  <para>
   There is no restriction regarding how many database users a given
   operating system user can correspond to, nor vice versa.  Thus, entries
   in a map should be thought of as meaning <quote>this operating system
   user is allowed to connect as this database user</quote>, rather than
   implying that they are equivalent.  The connection will be allowed if
   there is any map entry that pairs the user name obtained from the
   external authentication system with the database user name that the
   user has requested to connect as.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the <replaceable>system-username</> field starts with a slash (<literal>/</>),
   the remainder of the field is treated as a regular expression.
   (See <xref linkend="posix-syntax-details"> for details of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s regular expression syntax.)  The regular
   expression can include a single capture, or parenthesized subexpression,
   which can then be referenced in the <replaceable>database-username</>
   field as <literal>\1</> (backslash-one).  This allows the mapping of
   multiple user names in a single line, which is particularly useful for
   simple syntax substitutions.  For example, these entries
<programlisting>
mymap   /^(.*)@mydomain\.com$      \1
mymap   /^(.*)@otherdomain\.com$   guest
</programlisting>
   will remove the domain part for users with system user names that end with
   <literal>@mydomain.com</>, and allow any user whose system name ends with
   <literal>@otherdomain.com</> to log in as <literal>guest</>.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    Keep in mind that by default, a regular expression can match just part of
    a string.  It's usually wise to use <literal>^</> and <literal>$</>, as
    shown in the above example, to force the match to be to the entire
    system user name.

  <title>Authentication Methods</title>

   The following subsections describe the authentication methods in more detail.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="auth-trust">
   <title>Trust Authentication</title>

   <para>
    When <literal>trust</> authentication is specified,
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> assumes that anyone who can
    connect to the server is authorized to access the database with
    whatever database user name they specify (even superuser names).
    Of course, restrictions made in the <literal>database</> and
    <literal>user</> columns still apply.
    This method should only be used when there is adequate
    operating-system-level protection on connections to the server.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>trust</> authentication is appropriate and very
    convenient for local connections on a single-user workstation.  It
    is usually <emphasis>not</> appropriate by itself on a multiuser
    machine.  However, you might be able to use <literal>trust</> even
    on a multiuser machine, if you restrict access to the server's
    Unix-domain socket file using file-system permissions.  To do this, set the
    <varname>unix_socket_permissions</varname> (and possibly
    <varname>unix_socket_group</varname>) configuration parameters as
    described in <xref linkend="runtime-config-connection">.  Or you
    could set the <varname>unix_socket_directories</varname>
    configuration parameter to place the socket file in a suitably
    restricted directory.
   </para>

   <para>
    Setting file-system permissions only helps for Unix-socket connections.
    Local TCP/IP connections are not restricted by file-system permissions.
    Therefore, if you want to use file-system permissions for local security,
    remove the <literal>host ... 127.0.0.1 ...</> line from
    <filename>pg_hba.conf</>, or change it to a
    non-<literal>trust</> authentication method.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>trust</> authentication is only suitable for TCP/IP connections
    if you trust every user on every machine that is allowed to connect
    to the server by the <filename>pg_hba.conf</> lines that specify
    <literal>trust</>.  It is seldom reasonable to use <literal>trust</>
    for any TCP/IP connections other than those from <systemitem>localhost</> (127.0.0.1).

   <para>
    The password-based authentication methods are <literal>md5</>
    and <literal>password</>. These methods operate
    similarly except for the way that the password is sent across the
    connection, namely MD5-hashed and clear-text respectively.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you are at all concerned about password
    <quote>sniffing</> attacks then <literal>md5</> is preferred.
    Plain <literal>password</> should always be avoided if possible.
    However, <literal>md5</> cannot be used with the <xref
    linkend="guc-db-user-namespace"> feature.  If the connection is
    protected by SSL encryption then <literal>password</> can be used
    safely (though SSL certificate authentication might be a better
    choice if one is depending on using SSL).
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database passwords are
    separate from operating system user passwords. The password for
    each database user is stored in the <literal>pg_authid</> system
    catalog. Passwords can be managed with the SQL commands
    <xref linkend="sql-createuser"> and
    <xref linkend="sql-alterrole">,
    e.g., <userinput>CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD 'secret'</userinput>.
    If no password has been set up for a user, the stored password
    is null and password authentication will always fail for that user.

   <para>
    <productname>GSSAPI</productname> is an industry-standard protocol
    for secure authentication defined in RFC 2743.
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports
    <productname>GSSAPI</productname> with <productname>Kerberos</productname>
    authentication according to RFC 1964. <productname>GSSAPI</productname>
    provides automatic authentication (single sign-on) for systems
    that support it. The authentication itself is secure, but the
    data sent over the database connection will be sent unencrypted unless
    <acronym>SSL</acronym> is used.
   </para>

   <para>
    GSSAPI support has to be enabled when <productname>PostgreSQL</> is built;
    see <xref linkend="installation"> for more information.
   </para>

   <para>
    When <productname>GSSAPI</productname> uses
    <productname>Kerberos</productname>, it uses a standard principal
    in the format
    <literal><replaceable>servicename</>/<replaceable>hostname</>@<replaceable>realm</></literal>.
    The PostgreSQL server will accept any principal that is included in the keytab used by
    the server, but care needs to be taken to specify the correct principal details when
    making the connection from the client using the <literal>krbsrvname</> connection parameter. (See
    also <xref linkend="libpq-paramkeywords">.) The installation default can be
    changed from the default <literal>postgres</literal> at build time using
    <literal>./configure --with-krb-srvnam=</><replaceable>whatever</>.
    In most environments,
    this parameter never needs to be changed.
    Some Kerberos implementations might require a different service name,
    such as Microsoft Active Directory which requires the service name
    to be in upper case (<literal>POSTGRES</literal>).
   </para>
   <para>
    <replaceable>hostname</> is the fully qualified host name of the
    server machine. The service principal's realm is the preferred realm
    of the server machine.
   </para>

   <para>
    Client principals can be mapped to different <productname>PostgreSQL</>
    database user names with <filename>pg_ident.conf</>.  For example,
    <literal>pgusername@realm</> could be mapped to just <literal>pgusername</>.
    Alternatively, you can use the full <literal>username@realm</> principal as
    the role name in <productname>PostgreSQL</> without any mapping.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> also supports a parameter to strip the realm from
    the principal.  This method is supported for backwards compatibility and is
    strongly discouraged as it is then impossible to distinguish different users
    with the same user name but coming from different realms.  To enable this,
    set <literal>include_realm</> to 0.  For simple single-realm
    installations, <literal>include_realm</> combined with the
    <literal>krb_realm</> parameter (which checks that the realm provided
    matches exactly what is in the <literal>krb_realm</literal> parameter) would be a secure but
    less capable option compared to specifying an explicit mapping in
    <filename>pg_ident.conf</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Make sure that your server keytab file is readable (and preferably
    only readable) by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server
    account.  (See also <xref linkend="postgres-user">.) The location
    of the key file is specified by the <xref
    linkend="guc-krb-server-keyfile"> configuration
    parameter. The default is
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/etc/krb5.keytab</> (or whatever
    directory was specified as <varname>sysconfdir</> at build time).
    For security reasons, it is recommended to use a separate keytab
    just for the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server rather
    than opening up permissions on the system keytab file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The keytab file is generated by the Kerberos software; see the
    Kerberos documentation for details. The following example is
   for MIT-compatible Kerberos 5 implementations:
<screen>
<prompt>kadmin% </><userinput>ank -randkey postgres/server.my.domain.org</>
<prompt>kadmin% </><userinput>ktadd -k krb5.keytab postgres/server.my.domain.org</>
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    When connecting to the database make sure you have a ticket for a
    principal matching the requested database user name. For example, for
    database user name <literal>fred</>, principal
    <literal>fred@EXAMPLE.COM</> would be able to connect. To also allow
    principal <literal>fred/users.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</>, use a user name
    map, as described in <xref linkend="auth-username-maps">.

        stripped off before being passed through the user name mapping
        (<xref linkend="auth-username-maps">). This is discouraged and is
        primarily available for backwards compatibility as it is not secure
        in multi-realm environments unless <literal>krb_realm</literal> is also used.  Users

   <para>
    The <quote>Identification Protocol</quote> is described in
    RFC 1413. Virtually every Unix-like
    operating system ships with an ident server that listens on TCP
    port 113 by default. The basic functionality of an ident server
    is to answer questions like <quote>What user initiated the
    connection that goes out of your port <replaceable>X</replaceable>
    and connects to my port <replaceable>Y</replaceable>?</quote>.
    Since <productname>PostgreSQL</> knows both <replaceable>X</> and
    <replaceable>Y</> when a physical connection is established, it
    can interrogate the ident server on the host of the connecting
    client and can theoretically determine the operating system user
    for any given connection.
   </para>

   <para>
    The drawback of this procedure is that it depends on the integrity
    of the client: if the client machine is untrusted or compromised,
    an attacker could run just about any program on port 113 and
    return any user name they choose. This authentication method is
    therefore only appropriate for closed networks where each client
    machine is under tight control and where the database and system
    administrators operate in close contact. In other words, you must
    trust the machine running the ident server.
    Heed the warning:

   <para>
    Some ident servers have a nonstandard option that causes the returned

   <title>LDAP Authentication</title>

   <indexterm zone="auth-ldap">
    <primary>LDAP</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    This authentication method operates similarly to
    <literal>password</literal> except that it uses LDAP
    as the password verification method. LDAP is used only to validate
    the user name/password pairs. Therefore the user must already
    exist in the database before LDAP can be used for
    authentication.
   </para>

   <para>
    LDAP authentication can operate in two modes. In the first mode,
    which we will call the simple bind mode,
    the server will bind to the distinguished name constructed as
    <replaceable>prefix</> <replaceable>username</> <replaceable>suffix</>.
    Typically, the <replaceable>prefix</> parameter is used to specify
    <literal>cn=</>, or <replaceable>DOMAIN</><literal>\</> in an Active
    Directory environment.  <replaceable>suffix</> is used to specify the
    remaining part of the DN in a non-Active Directory environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    In the second mode, which we will call the search+bind mode,
    the server first binds to the LDAP directory with
    a fixed user name and password, specified with <replaceable>ldapbinddn</>
    and <replaceable>ldapbindpasswd</>, and performs a search for the user trying
    to log in to the database. If no user and password is configured, an
    anonymous bind will be attempted to the directory. The search will be
    performed over the subtree at <replaceable>ldapbasedn</>, and will try to
    do an exact match of the attribute specified in
    <replaceable>ldapsearchattribute</>.
    Once the user has been found in
    this search, the server disconnects and re-binds to the directory as
    this user, using the password specified by the client, to verify that the
    login is correct. This mode is the same as that used by LDAP authentication
    schemes in other software, such as Apache <literal>mod_authnz_ldap</literal> and <literal>pam_ldap</literal>.
    This method allows for significantly more flexibility
    in where the user objects are located in the directory, but will cause
    two separate connections to the LDAP server to be made.

    Here is an example for a simple-bind LDAP configuration:
<programlisting>
host ... ldap ldapserver=ldap.example.net ldapprefix="cn=" ldapsuffix=", dc=example, dc=net"
</programlisting>
    When a connection to the database server as database
    user <literal>someuser</literal> is requested, PostgreSQL will attempt to
    bind to the LDAP server using the DN <literal>cn=someuser, dc=example,
    dc=net</literal> and the password provided by the client.  If that connection
    succeeds, the database access is granted.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example for a search+bind configuration:
<programlisting>
host ... ldap ldapserver=ldap.example.net ldapbasedn="dc=example, dc=net" ldapsearchattribute=uid
</programlisting>
    When a connection to the database server as database
    user <literal>someuser</literal> is requested, PostgreSQL will attempt to
    bind anonymously (since <literal>ldapbinddn</literal> was not specified) to
    the LDAP server, perform a search for <literal>(uid=someuser)</literal>
    under the specified base DN.  If an entry is found, it will then attempt to
    bind using that found information and the password supplied by the client.
    If that second connection succeeds, the database access is granted.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is the same search+bind configuration written as a URL:
<programlisting>
host ... ldap ldapurl="ldap://ldap.example.net/dc=example,dc=net?uid?sub"
</programlisting>
    Some other software that supports authentication against LDAP uses the
    same URL format, so it will be easier to share the configuration.
   </para>

   <tip>
    <para>
     Since LDAP often uses commas and spaces to separate the different
     parts of a DN, it is often necessary to use double-quoted parameter
     values when configuring LDAP options, as shown in the examples.
