# Makefile--
#    Makefile for the port-specific subsystem of the backend
#
# You must invoke this make file with the PORTNAME variable set to the
# name of a port, i.e. the name of a subdirectory of the current directory.
# Example: 
#
#    make SUBSYS.o PORTNAME=linux
#
# We have two different modes of operation: 1) put stuff specific to Port X
# in subdirectory X and have that subdirectory's make file make it all, and 
# 2) use conditional statements in the present make file to include what's
# necessary for a specific port in our own output.  (1) came first, but (2)
# is superior for many things, like when the same thing needs to be done for
# multiple ports and you don't want to duplicate files in multiple 
# subdirectories.  Much of the stuff done via Method 1 today should probably
# be converted to Method 2.
