  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   Full Text Searching (or just <firstterm>text search</firstterm>) provides
   the capability to identify natural-language <firstterm>documents</firstterm> that
   satisfy a <firstterm>query</firstterm>, and optionally to sort them by
   relevance to the query.  The most common type of search
   is to find all documents containing given <firstterm>query terms</firstterm>
   and return them in order of their <firstterm>similarity</firstterm> to the
   query.  Notions of <varname>query</varname> and
   <varname>similarity</varname> are very flexible and depend on the specific
   application. The simplest search considers <varname>query</varname> as a
   set of words and <varname>similarity</varname> as the frequency of query
   words in the document.
  </para>

  <para>
   Textual search operators have existed in databases for years.
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
   <literal>~</literal>, <literal>~*</literal>, <literal>LIKE</literal>, and
   <literal>ILIKE</literal> operators for textual data types, but they lack
   many essential properties required by modern information systems:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist  spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is no linguistic support, even for English.  Regular expressions
     are not sufficient because they cannot easily handle derived words, e.g.,
     <literal>satisfies</literal> and <literal>satisfy</literal>. You might
     miss documents that contain <literal>satisfies</literal>, although you
     probably would like to find them when searching for
     <literal>satisfy</literal>. It is possible to use <literal>OR</literal>
     to search for multiple derived forms, but this is tedious and error-prone
     (some words can have several thousand derivatives).
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     They provide no ordering (ranking) of search results, which makes them
     ineffective when thousands of matching documents are found.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     They tend to be slow because there is no index support, so they must
     process all documents for every search.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Full text indexing allows documents to be <emphasis>preprocessed</emphasis>
   and an index saved for later rapid searching. Preprocessing includes:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist  mark="none">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Parsing documents into <firstterm>tokens</firstterm></emphasis>. It is
     useful to identify various classes of tokens, e.g., numbers, words,
     complex words, email addresses, so that they can be processed
     differently.  In principle token classes depend on the specific
     application, but for most purposes it is adequate to use a predefined
     set of classes.
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses a <firstterm>parser</firstterm> to
     perform this step.  A standard parser is provided, and custom parsers
     can be created for specific needs.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Converting tokens into <firstterm>lexemes</firstterm></emphasis>.
     A lexeme is a string, just like a token, but it has been
     <firstterm>normalized</firstterm> so that different forms of the same word
     are made alike.  For example, normalization almost always includes
     folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal
     of suffixes (such as <literal>s</literal> or <literal>es</literal> in English).
     This allows searches to find variant forms of the
     same word, without tediously entering all the possible variants.
     Also, this step typically eliminates <firstterm>stop words</firstterm>, which
     are words that are so common that they are useless for searching.
     (In short, then, tokens are raw fragments of the document text, while
     lexemes are words that are believed useful for indexing and searching.)
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses <firstterm>dictionaries</firstterm> to
     perform this step.  Various standard dictionaries are provided, and
     custom ones can be created for specific needs.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Storing preprocessed documents optimized for
     searching</emphasis>.  For example, each document can be represented
     as a sorted array of normalized lexemes. Along with the lexemes it is
     often desirable to store positional information to use for
     <firstterm>proximity ranking</firstterm>, so that a document that
     contains a more <quote>dense</quote> region of query words is
     assigned a higher rank than one with scattered query words.

   Dictionaries allow fine-grained control over how tokens are normalized.

  <para>
   A data type <type>tsvector</type> is provided for storing preprocessed
   documents, along with a type <type>tsquery</type> for representing processed
   queries (<xref linkend="datatype-textsearch"/>).  There are many
   functions and operators available for these data types
   (<xref linkend="functions-textsearch"/>), the most important of which is
   the match operator <literal>@@</literal>, which we introduce in
   <xref linkend="textsearch-matching"/>.  Full text searches can be accelerated
   using indexes (<xref linkend="textsearch-indexes"/>).
  </para>


  <sect2 id="textsearch-document">
   <title>What Is a Document?</title>

   <indexterm zone="textsearch-document">
    <primary>document</primary>
    <secondary>text search</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    A <firstterm>document</firstterm> is the unit of searching in a full text search
    system; for example, a magazine article or email message.  The text search
    engine must be able to parse documents and store associations of lexemes
    (key words) with their parent document. Later, these associations are
    used to search for documents that contain query words.
   </para>

   <para>
    For searches within <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>,
    a document is normally a textual field within a row of a database table,
    or possibly a combination (concatenation) of such fields, perhaps stored
    in several tables or obtained dynamically. In other words, a document can
    be constructed from different parts for indexing and it might not be
    stored anywhere as a whole. For example:

<programlisting>
SELECT title || ' ' ||  author || ' ' ||  abstract || ' ' || body AS document
FROM messages
WHERE mid = 12;

SELECT m.title || ' ' || m.author || ' ' || m.abstract || ' ' || d.body AS document
FROM messages m, docs d
WHERE m.mid = d.did AND m.mid = 12;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Actually, in these example queries, <function>coalesce</function>
     should be used to prevent a single <literal>NULL</literal> attribute from
     causing a <literal>NULL</literal> result for the whole document.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Another possibility is to store the documents as simple text files in the
    file system. In this case, the database can be used to store the full text
    index and to execute searches, and some unique identifier can be used to
    retrieve the document from the file system.  However, retrieving files
    from outside the database requires superuser permissions or special
    function support, so this is usually less convenient than keeping all
    the data inside <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  Also, keeping
    everything inside the database allows easy access
    to document metadata to assist in indexing and display.
   </para>

   <para>
    For text search purposes, each document must be reduced to the
    preprocessed <type>tsvector</type> format.  Searching and ranking
    are performed entirely on the <type>tsvector</type> representation
    of a document &mdash; the original text need only be retrieved
    when the document has been selected for display to a user.
    We therefore often speak of the <type>tsvector</type> as being the
    document, but of course it is only a compact representation of
    the full document.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-matching">
   <title>Basic Text Matching</title>

   <para>
    Full text searching in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is based on
    the match operator <literal>@@</literal>, which returns
    <literal>true</literal> if a <type>tsvector</type>
    (document) matches a <type>tsquery</type> (query).
    It doesn't matter which data type is written first:

<programlisting>
SELECT 'a fat cat sat on a mat and ate a fat rat'::tsvector @@ 'cat &amp; rat'::tsquery;
 ?column?
----------
 t

SELECT 'fat &amp; cow'::tsquery @@ 'a fat cat sat on a mat and ate a fat rat'::tsvector;
 ?column?
----------
 f
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    As the above example suggests, a <type>tsquery</type> is not just raw
    text, any more than a <type>tsvector</type> is.  A <type>tsquery</type>
    contains search terms, which must be already-normalized lexemes, and
    may combine multiple terms using AND, OR, NOT, and FOLLOWED BY operators.
    (For syntax details see <xref linkend="datatype-tsquery"/>.)  There are
    functions <function>to_tsquery</function>, <function>plainto_tsquery</function>,
    and <function>phraseto_tsquery</function>
    that are helpful in converting user-written text into a proper
    <type>tsquery</type>, primarily by normalizing words appearing in
    the text.  Similarly, <function>to_tsvector</function> is used to parse and
    normalize a document string.  So in practice a text search match would
    look more like this:

<programlisting>
SELECT to_tsvector('fat cats ate fat rats') @@ to_tsquery('fat &amp; rat');
 ?column?
----------
 t
</programlisting>

    Observe that this match would not succeed if written as

<programlisting>
SELECT 'fat cats ate fat rats'::tsvector @@ to_tsquery('fat &amp; rat');
 ?column?
----------
 f
</programlisting>

    since here no normalization of the word <literal>rats</literal> will occur.
    The elements of a <type>tsvector</type> are lexemes, which are assumed
    already normalized, so <literal>rats</literal> does not match <literal>rat</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>@@</literal> operator also
    supports <type>text</type> input, allowing explicit conversion of a text
    string to <type>tsvector</type> or <type>tsquery</type> to be skipped
    in simple cases.  The variants available are:

<programlisting>
tsvector @@ tsquery
tsquery  @@ tsvector
text @@ tsquery
text @@ text
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    The first two of these we saw already.
    The form <type>text</type> <literal>@@</literal> <type>tsquery</type>
    is equivalent to <literal>to_tsvector(x) @@ y</literal>.
    The form <type>text</type> <literal>@@</literal> <type>text</type>
    is equivalent to <literal>to_tsvector(x) @@ plainto_tsquery(y)</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Within a <type>tsquery</type>, the <literal>&amp;</literal> (AND) operator
    specifies that both its arguments must appear in the document to have a
    match.  Similarly, the <literal>|</literal> (OR) operator specifies that
    at least one of its arguments must appear, while the <literal>!</literal> (NOT)
    operator specifies that its argument must <emphasis>not</emphasis> appear in
    order to have a match.
    For example, the query <literal>fat &amp; ! rat</literal> matches documents that
    contain <literal>fat</literal> but not <literal>rat</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Searching for phrases is possible with the help of
    the <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal> (FOLLOWED BY) <type>tsquery</type> operator, which
    matches only if its arguments have matches that are adjacent and in the
    given order.  For example:

<programlisting>
SELECT to_tsvector('fatal error') @@ to_tsquery('fatal &lt;-&gt; error');
 ?column?
----------
 t

SELECT to_tsvector('error is not fatal') @@ to_tsquery('fatal &lt;-&gt; error');
 ?column?
----------
 f
</programlisting>

    There is a more general version of the FOLLOWED BY operator having the
    form <literal>&lt;<replaceable>N</replaceable>&gt;</literal>,
    where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is an integer standing for the difference between
    the positions of the matching lexemes.  <literal>&lt;1&gt;</literal> is
    the same as <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal>, while <literal>&lt;2&gt;</literal>
    allows exactly one other lexeme to appear between the matches, and so
    on.  The <literal>phraseto_tsquery</literal> function makes use of this
    operator to construct a <literal>tsquery</literal> that can match a multi-word
    phrase when some of the words are stop words.  For example:

<programlisting>
SELECT phraseto_tsquery('cats ate rats');
       phraseto_tsquery
-------------------------------
 'cat' &lt;-&gt; 'ate' &lt;-&gt; 'rat'

SELECT phraseto_tsquery('the cats ate the rats');
       phraseto_tsquery
-------------------------------
 'cat' &lt;-&gt; 'ate' &lt;2&gt; 'rat'
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    A special case that's sometimes useful is that <literal>&lt;0&gt;</literal>
    can be used to require that two patterns match the same word.
   </para>

   <para>
    Parentheses can be used to control nesting of the <type>tsquery</type>
    operators.  Without parentheses, <literal>|</literal> binds least tightly,
    then <literal>&amp;</literal>, then <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal>,
    and <literal>!</literal> most tightly.
   </para>

   <para>
    It's worth noticing that the AND/OR/NOT operators mean something subtly
    different when they are within the arguments of a FOLLOWED BY operator
    than when they are not, because within FOLLOWED BY the exact position of
    the match is significant.  For example, normally <literal>!x</literal> matches
    only documents that do not contain <literal>x</literal> anywhere.
    But <literal>!x &lt;-&gt; y</literal> matches <literal>y</literal> if it is not
    immediately after an <literal>x</literal>; an occurrence of <literal>x</literal>
    elsewhere in the document does not prevent a match.  Another example is
    that <literal>x &amp; y</literal> normally only requires that <literal>x</literal>
    and <literal>y</literal> both appear somewhere in the document, but
    <literal>(x &amp; y) &lt;-&gt; z</literal> requires <literal>x</literal>
    and <literal>y</literal> to match at the same place, immediately before
    a <literal>z</literal>.  Thus this query behaves differently from
    <literal>x &lt;-&gt; z &amp; y &lt;-&gt; z</literal>, which will match a
    document containing two separate sequences <literal>x z</literal> and
    <literal>y z</literal>.  (This specific query is useless as written,
    since <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal> could not match at the same place;
    but with more complex situations such as prefix-match patterns, a query
    of this form could be useful.)
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-intro-configurations">
   <title>Configurations</title>

   <para>
    The above are all simple text search examples.  As mentioned before, full
    text search functionality includes the ability to do many more things:
    skip indexing certain words (stop words), process synonyms, and use
    sophisticated parsing, e.g., parse based on more than just white space.
    This functionality is controlled by <firstterm>text search
    configurations</firstterm>.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> comes with predefined
    configurations for many languages, and you can easily create your own
    configurations.  (<application>psql</application>'s <command>\dF</command> command
    shows all available configurations.)
   </para>

   <para>
    During installation an appropriate configuration is selected and
    <xref linkend="guc-default-text-search-config"/> is set accordingly
    in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.  If you are using the same text search
    configuration for the entire cluster you can use the value in
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.  To use different configurations
    throughout the cluster but the same configuration within any one database,
    use <command>ALTER DATABASE ... SET</command>.  Otherwise, you can set
    <varname>default_text_search_config</varname> in each session.
   </para>

   <para>
    Each text search function that depends on a configuration has an optional
    <type>regconfig</type> argument, so that the configuration to use can be
    specified explicitly.  <varname>default_text_search_config</varname>
    is used only when this argument is omitted.
   </para>

   <para>
    To make it easier to build custom text search configurations, a
    configuration is built up from simpler database objects.
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s text search facility provides
    four types of configuration-related database objects:
   </para>

  <itemizedlist  spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <firstterm>Text search parsers</firstterm> break documents into tokens
     and classify each token (for example, as words or numbers).

   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>

    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>

     dictionaries.  (A dictionary simply specifies a template and a set
     of parameters for the template.)
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <firstterm>Text search configurations</firstterm> select a parser and a set
     of dictionaries to use to normalize the tokens produced by the parser.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    Text search parsers and templates are built from low-level C functions;
    therefore it requires C programming ability to develop new ones, and
    superuser privileges to install one into a database.  (There are examples
    of add-on parsers and templates in the <filename>contrib/</filename> area of the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution.)  Since dictionaries and
    configurations just parameterize and connect together some underlying
    parsers and templates, no special privilege is needed to create a new
    dictionary or configuration.  Examples of creating custom dictionaries and
    configurations appear later in this chapter.
   </para>

  </sect2>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="textsearch-tables">
  <title>Tables and Indexes</title>

  <para>
   The examples in the previous section illustrated full text matching using
   simple constant strings.  This section shows how to search table data,
   optionally using indexes.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-tables-search">
   <title>Searching a Table</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to do a full text search without an index.  A simple query
    to print the <structname>title</structname> of each row that contains the word
    <literal>friend</literal> in its <structfield>body</structfield> field is:

<programlisting>
SELECT title
FROM pgweb
WHERE to_tsvector('english', body) @@ to_tsquery('english', 'friend');
</programlisting>

    This will also find related words such as <literal>friends</literal>
    and <literal>friendly</literal>, since all these are reduced to the same
    normalized lexeme.
   </para>

   <para>
    The query above specifies that the <literal>english</literal> configuration
    is to be used to parse and normalize the strings.  Alternatively we
    could omit the configuration parameters:

<programlisting>
SELECT title
FROM pgweb
WHERE to_tsvector(body) @@ to_tsquery('friend');
</programlisting>

    This query will use the configuration set by <xref
    linkend="guc-default-text-search-config"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    A more complex example is to
    select the ten most recent documents that contain <literal>create</literal> and
    <literal>table</literal> in the <structname>title</structname> or <structname>body</structname>:

<programlisting>
SELECT title
FROM pgweb
WHERE to_tsvector(title || ' ' || body) @@ to_tsquery('create &amp; table')
ORDER BY last_mod_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
</programlisting>

    For clarity we omitted the <function>coalesce</function> function calls
    which would be needed to find rows that contain <literal>NULL</literal>
    in one of the two fields.
   </para>

   <para>
    Although these queries will work without an index, most applications
    will find this approach too slow, except perhaps for occasional ad-hoc
    searches.  Practical use of text searching usually requires creating
    an index.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-tables-index">
   <title>Creating Indexes</title>

   <para>
    We can create a <acronym>GIN</acronym> index (<xref
    linkend="textsearch-indexes"/>) to speed up text searches:

<programlisting>
CREATE INDEX pgweb_idx ON pgweb USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', body));
</programlisting>

    Notice that the 2-argument version of <function>to_tsvector</function> is
    used.  Only text search functions that specify a configuration name can
    be used in expression indexes (<xref linkend="indexes-expressional"/>).
    This is because the index contents must be unaffected by <xref
    linkend="guc-default-text-search-config"/>.  If they were affected, the
    index contents might be inconsistent because different entries could
    contain <type>tsvector</type>s that were created with different text search
    configurations, and there would be no way to guess which was which.  It
    would be impossible to dump and restore such an index correctly.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because the two-argument version of <function>to_tsvector</function> was
    used in the index above, only a query reference that uses the 2-argument
    version of <function>to_tsvector</function> with the same configuration
    name will use that index.  That is, <literal>WHERE
    to_tsvector('english', body) @@ 'a &amp; b'</literal> can use the index,
    but <literal>WHERE to_tsvector(body) @@ 'a &amp; b'</literal> cannot.
    This ensures that an index will be used only with the same configuration
    used to create the index entries.
   </para>

  <para>
    It is possible to set up more complex expression indexes wherein the
    configuration name is specified by another column, e.g.:

<programlisting>
CREATE INDEX pgweb_idx ON pgweb USING GIN (to_tsvector(config_name, body));
</programlisting>

    where <literal>config_name</literal> is a column in the <literal>pgweb</literal>
    table.  This allows mixed configurations in the same index while
    recording which configuration was used for each index entry.  This
    would be useful, for example, if the document collection contained
    documents in different languages.  Again,
    queries that are meant to use the index must be phrased to match, e.g.,
    <literal>WHERE to_tsvector(config_name, body) @@ 'a &amp; b'</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Indexes can even concatenate columns:

<programlisting>
CREATE INDEX pgweb_idx ON pgweb USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || body));
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Another approach is to create a separate <type>tsvector</type> column
    to hold the output of <function>to_tsvector</function>.  To keep this
    column automatically up to date with its source data, use a stored
    generated column.  This example is a
    concatenation of <literal>title</literal> and <literal>body</literal>,
    using <function>coalesce</function> to ensure that one field will still be
    indexed when the other is <literal>NULL</literal>:

<programlisting>
ALTER TABLE pgweb
    ADD COLUMN textsearchable_index_col tsvector
               GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title, '') || ' ' || coalesce(body, ''))) STORED;
</programlisting>

    Then we create a <acronym>GIN</acronym> index to speed up the search:

<programlisting>
CREATE INDEX textsearch_idx ON pgweb USING GIN (textsearchable_index_col);
</programlisting>

    Now we are ready to perform a fast full text search:

<programlisting>
SELECT title
FROM pgweb
WHERE textsearchable_index_col @@ to_tsquery('create &amp; table')
ORDER BY last_mod_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    One advantage of the separate-column approach over an expression index
    is that it is not necessary to explicitly specify the text search
    configuration in queries in order to make use of the index.  As shown
    in the example above, the query can depend on
    <varname>default_text_search_config</varname>.  Another advantage is that
    searches will be faster, since it will not be necessary to redo the
    <function>to_tsvector</function> calls to verify index matches.  (This is more
    important when using a GiST index than a GIN index; see <xref
    linkend="textsearch-indexes"/>.)  The expression-index approach is
    simpler to set up, however, and it requires less disk space since the
    <type>tsvector</type> representation is not stored explicitly.

 <sect1 id="textsearch-controls">
  <title>Controlling Text Search</title>

  <para>
   To implement full text searching there must be a function to create a
   <type>tsvector</type> from a document and a <type>tsquery</type> from a
   user query. Also, we need to return results in a useful order, so we need
   a function that compares documents with respect to their relevance to
   the query. It's also important to be able to display the results nicely.
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides support for all of these
   functions.

  <sect2 id="textsearch-parsing-documents">
   <title>Parsing Documents</title>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides the
    function <function>to_tsvector</function> for converting a document to
    the <type>tsvector</type> data type.
   </para>

   </indexterm>

<synopsis>
to_tsvector(<optional> <replaceable class="parameter">config</replaceable> <type>regconfig</type>, </optional> <replaceable class="parameter">document</replaceable> <type>text</type>) returns <type>tsvector</type>
</synopsis>

   <para>
    <function>to_tsvector</function> parses a textual document into tokens,
    reduces the tokens to lexemes, and returns a <type>tsvector</type> which
    lists the lexemes together with their positions in the document.
    The document is processed according to the specified or default
    text search configuration.
    Here is a simple example:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'a fat  cat sat on a mat - it ate a fat rats');
                  to_tsvector
-----------------------------------------------------
 'ate':9 'cat':3 'fat':2,11 'mat':7 'rat':12 'sat':4
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    In the example above we see that the resulting <type>tsvector</type> does not
    contain the words <literal>a</literal>, <literal>on</literal>, or
    <literal>it</literal>, the word <literal>rats</literal> became
    <literal>rat</literal>, and the punctuation sign <literal>-</literal> was
    ignored.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <function>to_tsvector</function> function internally calls a parser
    which breaks the document text into tokens and assigns a type to
    each token.  For each token, a list of
    dictionaries (<xref linkend="textsearch-dictionaries"/>) is consulted,
    where the list can vary depending on the token type.  The first dictionary
    that <firstterm>recognizes</firstterm> the token emits one or more normalized
    <firstterm>lexemes</firstterm> to represent the token.  For example,
    <literal>rats</literal> became <literal>rat</literal> because one of the
    dictionaries recognized that the word <literal>rats</literal> is a plural
    form of <literal>rat</literal>.  Some words are recognized as
    <firstterm>stop words</firstterm> (<xref linkend="textsearch-stopwords"/>), which
    causes them to be ignored since they occur too frequently to be useful in
    searching.  In our example these are
    <literal>a</literal>, <literal>on</literal>, and <literal>it</literal>.
    If no dictionary in the list recognizes the token then it is also ignored.
    In this example that happened to the punctuation sign <literal>-</literal>
    because there are in fact no dictionaries assigned for its token type
    (<literal>Space symbols</literal>), meaning space tokens will never be
    indexed. The choices of parser, dictionaries and which types of tokens to
    index are determined by the selected text search configuration (<xref
    linkend="textsearch-configuration"/>).  It is possible to have
    many different configurations in the same database, and predefined
    configurations are available for various languages. In our example
    we used the default configuration <literal>english</literal> for the
    English language.
   </para>

   <para>
    The function <function>setweight</function> can be used to label the
    entries of a <type>tsvector</type> with a given <firstterm>weight</firstterm>,
    where a weight is one of the letters <literal>A</literal>, <literal>B</literal>,
    <literal>C</literal>, or <literal>D</literal>.
    This is typically used to mark entries coming from
    different parts of a document, such as title versus body.  Later, this
    information can be used for ranking of search results.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because <function>to_tsvector</function>(<literal>NULL</literal>) will
    return <literal>NULL</literal>, it is recommended to use
    <function>coalesce</function> whenever a field might be null.
    Here is the recommended method for creating
    a <type>tsvector</type> from a structured document:

<programlisting>
UPDATE tt SET ti =
    setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(title,'')), 'A')    ||
    setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(keyword,'')), 'B')  ||
    setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(abstract,'')), 'C') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(body,'')), 'D');
</programlisting>

    Here we have used <function>setweight</function> to label the source
    of each lexeme in the finished <type>tsvector</type>, and then merged
    the labeled <type>tsvector</type> values using the <type>tsvector</type>
    concatenation operator <literal>||</literal>.  (<xref
    linkend="textsearch-manipulate-tsvector"/> gives details about these
    operations.)

  <sect2 id="textsearch-parsing-queries">
   <title>Parsing Queries</title>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides the

    <function>phraseto_tsquery</function> and
    <function>websearch_to_tsquery</function>

    input. <function>websearch_to_tsquery</function> is a simplified version
    of <function>to_tsquery</function> with an alternative syntax, similar
    to the one used by web search engines.

to_tsquery(<optional> <replaceable class="parameter">config</replaceable> <type>regconfig</type>, </optional> <replaceable class="parameter">querytext</replaceable> <type>text</type>) returns <type>tsquery</type>
</synopsis>

   <para>
    <function>to_tsquery</function> creates a <type>tsquery</type> value from
    <replaceable>querytext</replaceable>, which must consist of single tokens
    separated by the <type>tsquery</type> operators <literal>&amp;</literal> (AND),
    <literal>|</literal> (OR), <literal>!</literal> (NOT), and
    <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal> (FOLLOWED BY), possibly grouped
    using parentheses.  In other words, the input to
    <function>to_tsquery</function> must already follow the general rules for
    <type>tsquery</type> input, as described in <xref
    linkend="datatype-tsquery"/>.  The difference is that while basic
    <type>tsquery</type> input takes the tokens at face value,
    <function>to_tsquery</function> normalizes each token into a lexeme using
    the specified or default configuration, and discards any tokens that are
    stop words according to the configuration.  For example:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsquery('english', 'The &amp; Fat &amp; Rats');
  to_tsquery
---------------
 'fat' &amp; 'rat'
</screen>

    As in basic <type>tsquery</type> input, weight(s) can be attached to each
    lexeme to restrict it to match only <type>tsvector</type> lexemes of those
    weight(s).  For example:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsquery('english', 'Fat | Rats:AB');
    to_tsquery
------------------
 'fat' | 'rat':AB
</screen>

    Also, <literal>*</literal> can be attached to a lexeme to specify prefix matching:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsquery('supern:*A &amp; star:A*B');
        to_tsquery
--------------------------
 'supern':*A &amp; 'star':*AB
</screen>

    Such a lexeme will match any word in a <type>tsvector</type> that begins
    with the given string.
   </para>

   <para>
    <function>to_tsquery</function> can also accept single-quoted
    phrases.  This is primarily useful when the configuration includes a
    thesaurus dictionary that may trigger on such phrases.
    In the example below, a thesaurus contains the rule <literal>supernovae
    stars : sn</literal>:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsquery('''supernovae stars'' &amp; !crab');
  to_tsquery
---------------
 'sn' &amp; !'crab'
</screen>

    Without quotes, <function>to_tsquery</function> will generate a syntax
    error for tokens that are not separated by an AND, OR, or FOLLOWED BY
    operator.

   <para>
    <function>plainto_tsquery</function> transforms the unformatted text
    <replaceable>querytext</replaceable> to a <type>tsquery</type> value.
    The text is parsed and normalized much as for <function>to_tsvector</function>,

   <para>
    <function>phraseto_tsquery</function> behaves much like
    <function>plainto_tsquery</function>, except that it inserts
    the <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal> (FOLLOWED BY) operator between
    surviving words instead of the <literal>&amp;</literal> (AND) operator.
    Also, stop words are not simply discarded, but are accounted for by
    inserting <literal>&lt;<replaceable>N</replaceable>&gt;</literal> operators rather
    than <literal>&lt;-&gt;</literal> operators.  This function is useful
    when searching for exact lexeme sequences, since the FOLLOWED BY
    operators check lexeme order not just the presence of all the lexemes.

   <para>
    <function>websearch_to_tsquery</function> creates a <type>tsquery</type>
    value from <replaceable>querytext</replaceable> using an alternative
    syntax in which simple unformatted text is a valid query.
    Unlike <function>plainto_tsquery</function>
    and <function>phraseto_tsquery</function>, it also recognizes certain
    operators. Moreover, this function will never raise syntax errors,
    which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search.
    The following syntax is supported:

    <itemizedlist  spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
     <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>unquoted text</literal>: text not inside quote marks will be

     </listitem>
     <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>"quoted text"</literal>: text inside quote marks will be

     </listitem>
     <listitem>

    Other punctuation is ignored.  So

    the <function>websearch_to_tsquery</function> function will not
    recognize <type>tsquery</type> operators, weight labels, or prefix-match

   <title>Ranking Search Results</title>

   <para>
    Ranking attempts to measure how relevant documents are to a particular
    query, so that when there are many matches the most relevant ones can be
    shown first.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides two
    predefined ranking functions, which take into account lexical, proximity,
    and structural information; that is, they consider how often the query
    terms appear in the document, how close together the terms are in the
    document, and how important is the part of the document where they occur.
    However, the concept of relevancy is vague and very application-specific.
    Different applications might require additional information for ranking,
    e.g., document modification time.  The built-in ranking functions are only
    examples.  You can write your own ranking functions and/or combine their
    results with additional factors to fit your specific needs.
   </para>

   <para>
    The two ranking functions currently available are:

    <variablelist>

     <varlistentry>

      <term>
       <indexterm>
        <primary>ts_rank</primary>
       </indexterm>

       <literal>ts_rank(<optional> <replaceable class="parameter">weights</replaceable> <type>float4[]</type>, </optional> <replaceable class="parameter">vector</replaceable> <type>tsvector</type>, <replaceable class="parameter">query</replaceable> <type>tsquery</type> <optional>, <replaceable class="parameter">normalization</replaceable> <type>integer</type> </optional>) returns <type>float4</type></literal>
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Ranks vectors based on the frequency of their matching lexemes.

      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This function computes the <firstterm>cover density</firstterm>
        ranking for the given document vector and query, as described in
        Clarke, Cormack, and Tudhope's "Relevance Ranking for One to Three
        Term Queries" in the journal "Information Processing and Management",
        1999.  Cover density is similar to <function>ts_rank</function> ranking
        except that the proximity of matching lexemes to each other is
        taken into consideration.
       </para>

       <para>
        This function requires lexeme positional information to perform
        its calculation.  Therefore, it ignores any <quote>stripped</quote>
        lexemes in the <type>tsvector</type>.  If there are no unstripped
        lexemes in the input, the result will be zero.  (See <xref
        linkend="textsearch-manipulate-tsvector"/> for more information
        about the <function>strip</function> function and positional information
        in <type>tsvector</type>s.)
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

   </para>

   <para>
    For both these functions,
    the optional <replaceable class="parameter">weights</replaceable>
    argument offers the ability to weigh word instances more or less
    heavily depending on how they are labeled.  The weight arrays specify
    how heavily to weigh each category of word, in the order:

<synopsis>
{D-weight, C-weight, B-weight, A-weight}
</synopsis>

    If no <replaceable class="parameter">weights</replaceable> are provided,
    then these defaults are used:

<programlisting>
{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}
</programlisting>

    Typically weights are used to mark words from special areas of the
    document, like the title or an initial abstract, so they can be
    treated with more or less importance than words in the document body.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since a longer document has a greater chance of containing a query term
    it is reasonable to take into account document size, e.g., a hundred-word
    document with five instances of a search word is probably more relevant
    than a thousand-word document with five instances.  Both ranking functions
    take an integer <replaceable>normalization</replaceable> option that
    specifies whether and how a document's length should impact its rank.
    The integer option controls several behaviors, so it is a bit mask:
    you can specify one or more behaviors using
    <literal>|</literal> (for example, <literal>2|4</literal>).

    <itemizedlist  spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
     <listitem>
      <para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       32 divides the rank by itself + 1
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    If more than one flag bit is specified, the transformations are
    applied in the order listed.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is important to note that the ranking functions do not use any global
    information, so it is impossible to produce a fair normalization to 1% or
    100% as sometimes desired.  Normalization option 32
    (<literal>rank/(rank+1)</literal>) can be applied to scale all ranks
    into the range zero to one, but of course this is just a cosmetic change;
    it will not affect the ordering of the search results.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example that selects only the ten highest-ranked matches:

    Ranking can be expensive since it requires consulting the
    <type>tsvector</type> of each matching document, which can be I/O bound and
    therefore slow. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to avoid since
    practical queries often result in large numbers of matches.

   <title>Highlighting Results</title>

   <para>
    To present search results it is ideal to show a part of each document and
    how it is related to the query. Usually, search engines show fragments of
    the document with marked search terms.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    provides a function <function>ts_headline</function> that
    implements this functionality.

</synopsis>

   <para>
    <function>ts_headline</function> accepts a document along
    with a query, and returns an excerpt from
    the document in which terms from the query are highlighted.
    Specifically, the function will use the query to select relevant
    text fragments, and then highlight all words that appear in the query,
    even if those word positions do not match the query's restrictions.  The
    configuration to be used to parse the document can be specified by
    <replaceable>config</replaceable>; if <replaceable>config</replaceable>
    is omitted, the
    <varname>default_text_search_config</varname> configuration is used.
   </para>

   <para>
    If an <replaceable>options</replaceable> string is specified it must
    consist of a comma-separated list of one or more
    <replaceable>option</replaceable><literal>=</literal><replaceable>value</replaceable> pairs.
    The available options are:

    These option names are recognized case-insensitively.
    You must double-quote string values if they contain spaces or commas.

   <para>
    In non-fragment-based headline
    generation, <function>ts_headline</function> locates matches for the
    given <replaceable class="parameter">query</replaceable> and chooses a
    single one to display, preferring matches that have more query words
    within the allowed headline length.
    In fragment-based headline generation, <function>ts_headline</function>
    locates the query matches and splits each match
    into <quote>fragments</quote> of no more than <literal>MaxWords</literal>
    words each, preferring fragments with more query words, and when
    possible <quote>stretching</quote> fragments to include surrounding
    words.  The fragment-based mode is thus more useful when the query
    matches span large sections of the document, or when it's desirable to
    display multiple matches.
    In either mode, if no query matches can be identified, then a single
    fragment of the first <literal>MinWords</literal> words in the document
    will be displayed.

      <para>
       The <type>tsvector</type> concatenation operator
       returns a vector which combines the lexemes and positional information
       of the two vectors given as arguments.  Positions and weight labels
       are retained during the concatenation.
       Positions appearing in the right-hand vector are offset by the largest
       position mentioned in the left-hand vector, so that the result is
       nearly equivalent to the result of performing <function>to_tsvector</function>
       on the concatenation of the two original document strings.  (The
       equivalence is not exact, because any stop-words removed from the
       end of the left-hand argument will not affect the result, whereas
       they would have affected the positions of the lexemes in the
       right-hand argument if textual concatenation were used.)
      </para>

      <para>
       One advantage of using concatenation in the vector form, rather than
       concatenating text before applying <function>to_tsvector</function>, is that
       you can use different configurations to parse different sections
       of the document.  Also, because the <function>setweight</function> function
       marks all lexemes of the given vector the same way, it is necessary
       to parse the text and do <function>setweight</function> before concatenating
       if you want to label different parts of the document with different

    <para>
     The <function>ts_rewrite</function> family of functions search a
     given <type>tsquery</type> for occurrences of a target
     subquery, and replace each occurrence with a
     substitute subquery.  In essence this operation is a
     <type>tsquery</type>-specific version of substring replacement.
     A target and substitute combination can be
     thought of as a <firstterm>query rewrite rule</firstterm>.  A collection
     of such rewrite rules can be a powerful search aid.
     For example, you can expand the search using synonyms
     (e.g., <literal>new york</literal>, <literal>big apple</literal>, <literal>nyc</literal>,
     <literal>gotham</literal>) or narrow the search to direct the user to some hot
     topic.  There is some overlap in functionality between this feature
     and thesaurus dictionaries (<xref linkend="textsearch-thesaurus"/>).
     However, you can modify a set of rewrite rules on-the-fly without

        Note that when multiple rewrite rules are applied in this way,

    <para>
     Let's consider a real-life astronomical example. We'll expand query
     <literal>supernovae</literal> using table-driven rewriting rules:

<screen>
CREATE TABLE aliases (t tsquery primary key, s tsquery);
INSERT INTO aliases VALUES(to_tsquery('supernovae'), to_tsquery('supernovae|sn'));

SELECT ts_rewrite(to_tsquery('supernovae &amp; crab'), 'SELECT * FROM aliases');
           ts_rewrite
---------------------------------
 'crab' &amp; ( 'supernova' | 'sn' )
</screen>

     We can change the rewriting rules just by updating the table:

<screen>
UPDATE aliases
SET s = to_tsquery('supernovae|sn &amp; !nebulae')
WHERE t = to_tsquery('supernovae');

SELECT ts_rewrite(to_tsquery('supernovae &amp; crab'), 'SELECT * FROM aliases');

---------------------------------------------
 'crab' &amp; ( 'supernova' | 'sn' &amp; !'nebula' )
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     Rewriting can be slow when there are many rewriting rules, since it
     checks every rule for a possible match. To filter out obvious non-candidate
     rules we can use the containment operators for the <type>tsquery</type>
     type. In the example below, we select only those rules which might match
     the original query:

<screen>
SELECT ts_rewrite('a &amp; b'::tsquery,
                  'SELECT t,s FROM aliases WHERE ''a &amp; b''::tsquery @&gt; t');

   <para>
    These trigger functions automatically compute a <type>tsvector</type>
    column from one or more textual columns, under the control of
    parameters specified in the <command>CREATE TRIGGER</command> command.
    An example of their use is:

<screen>
CREATE TABLE messages (
    title       text,
    body        text,
    tsv         tsvector
);

CREATE TRIGGER tsvectorupdate BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
ON messages FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION
tsvector_update_trigger(tsv, 'pg_catalog.english', title, body);

INSERT INTO messages VALUES('title here', 'the body text is here');

SELECT * FROM messages;
   title    |         body          |            tsv
------------+-----------------------+----------------------------
 title here | the body text is here | 'bodi':4 'text':5 'titl':1

SELECT title, body FROM messages WHERE tsv @@ to_tsquery('title &amp; body');
   title    |         body
------------+-----------------------
 title here | the body text is here
</screen>

    Having created this trigger, any change in <structfield>title</structfield> or
    <structfield>body</structfield> will automatically be reflected into
    <structfield>tsv</structfield>, without the application having to worry about it.
   </para>

   <para>
    The first trigger argument must be the name of the <type>tsvector</type>
    column to be updated.  The second argument specifies the text search
    configuration to be used to perform the conversion.  For
    <function>tsvector_update_trigger</function>, the configuration name is simply
    given as the second trigger argument.  It must be schema-qualified as
    shown above, so that the trigger behavior will not change with changes
    in <varname>search_path</varname>.  For
    <function>tsvector_update_trigger_column</function>, the second trigger argument
    is the name of another table column, which must be of type
    <type>regconfig</type>.  This allows a per-row selection of configuration
    to be made.  The remaining argument(s) are the names of textual columns
    (of type <type>text</type>, <type>varchar</type>, or <type>char</type>).  These
    will be included in the document in the order given.  NULL values will
    be skipped (but the other columns will still be indexed).
   </para>

   <para>
    A limitation of these built-in triggers is that they treat all the
    input columns alike.  To process columns differently &mdash; for
    example, to weight title differently from body &mdash; it is necessary
    to write a custom trigger.  Here is an example using
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application> as the trigger language:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION messages_trigger() RETURNS trigger AS $$
begin
  new.tsv :=
     setweight(to_tsvector('pg_catalog.english', coalesce(new.title,'')), 'A') ||
     setweight(to_tsvector('pg_catalog.english', coalesce(new.body,'')), 'D');
  return new;
end
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER tsvectorupdate BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
    ON messages FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION messages_trigger();
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Keep in mind that it is important to specify the configuration name
    explicitly when creating <type>tsvector</type> values inside triggers,
    so that the column's contents will not be affected by changes to
    <varname>default_text_search_config</varname>.  Failure to do this is likely to
    lead to problems such as search results changing after a dump and restore.

  <note>
   <para>
    The parser's notion of a <quote>letter</quote> is determined by the database's
    locale setting, specifically <varname>lc_ctype</varname>.  Words containing
    only the basic ASCII letters are reported as a separate token type,
    since it is sometimes useful to distinguish them.  In most European
    languages, token types <literal>word</literal> and <literal>asciiword</literal>
    should be treated alike.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>email</literal> does not support all valid email characters as
    defined by <ulink url="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322">RFC 5322</ulink>.
    Specifically, the only non-alphanumeric characters supported for
    email user names are period, dash, and underscore.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   It is possible for the parser to produce overlapping tokens from the same
   piece of text.  As an example, a hyphenated word will be reported both
   as the entire word and as each component:

<screen>
SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts_debug('foo-bar-beta1');
      alias      |               description                |     token
-----------------+------------------------------------------+---------------
 numhword        | Hyphenated word, letters and digits      | foo-bar-beta1
 hword_asciipart | Hyphenated word part, all ASCII          | foo
 blank           | Space symbols                            | -
 hword_asciipart | Hyphenated word part, all ASCII          | bar
 blank           | Space symbols                            | -
 hword_numpart   | Hyphenated word part, letters and digits | beta1
</screen>

   This behavior is desirable since it allows searches to work for both
   the whole compound word and for components.  Here is another
   instructive example:

<screen>
SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts_debug('http://example.com/stuff/index.html');
  alias   |  description  |            token
----------+---------------+------------------------------
 protocol | Protocol head | http://
 url      | URL           | example.com/stuff/index.html
 host     | Host          | example.com
 url_path | URL path      | /stuff/index.html
</screen>

   Dictionaries are used to eliminate words that should not be considered in a

   that different derived forms of the same word will match.  A successfully
   normalized word is called a <firstterm>lexeme</firstterm>.  Aside from
   improving search quality, normalization and removal of stop words reduce the
   size of the <type>tsvector</type> representation of a document, thereby
   improving performance.  Normalization does not always have linguistic meaning
   and usually depends on application semantics.

   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides predefined dictionaries for

   dictionary template is described below.  If no existing
   template is suitable, it is possible to create new ones; see the
   <filename>contrib/</filename> area of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution
   for examples.
  </para>

  <para>
   A text search configuration binds a parser together with a set of
   dictionaries to process the parser's output tokens.  For each token
   type that the parser can return, a separate list of dictionaries is
   specified by the configuration.  When a token of that type is found
   by the parser, each dictionary in the list is consulted in turn,
   until some dictionary recognizes it as a known word.  If it is identified
   as a stop word, or if no dictionary recognizes the token, it will be
   discarded and not indexed or searched for.
   Normally, the first dictionary that returns a non-<literal>NULL</literal>
   output determines the result, and any remaining dictionaries are not
   consulted; but a filtering dictionary can replace the given word
   with a modified word, which is then passed to subsequent dictionaries.
  </para>

  <para>
   The general rule for configuring a list of dictionaries
   is to place first the most narrow, most specific dictionary, then the more
   general dictionaries, finishing with a very general dictionary, like
   a <application>Snowball</application> stemmer or <literal>simple</literal>, which
   recognizes everything.  For example, for an astronomy-specific search
   (<literal>astro_en</literal> configuration) one could bind token type
   <type>asciiword</type> (ASCII word) to a synonym dictionary of astronomical
   terms, a general English dictionary and a <application>Snowball</application> English
   stemmer:

<programlisting>
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION astro_en
    ADD MAPPING FOR asciiword WITH astrosyn, english_ispell, english_stem;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   A filtering dictionary can be placed anywhere in the list, except at the
   end where it'd be useless.  Filtering dictionaries are useful to partially
   normalize words to simplify the task of later dictionaries.  For example,
   a filtering dictionary could be used to remove accents from accented
   letters, as is done by the <xref linkend="unaccent"/> module.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-stopwords">
   <title>Stop Words</title>

   <para>
    Stop words are words that are very common, appear in almost every
    document, and have no discrimination value. Therefore, they can be ignored
    in the context of full text searching. For example, every English text
    contains words like <literal>a</literal> and <literal>the</literal>, so it is
    useless to store them in an index.  However, stop words do affect the
    positions in <type>tsvector</type>, which in turn affect ranking:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'in the list of stop words');
        to_tsvector
----------------------------
 'list':3 'stop':5 'word':6
</screen>

    The missing positions 1,2,4 are because of stop words.  Ranks
    calculated for documents with and without stop words are quite different:

<screen>
SELECT ts_rank_cd (to_tsvector('english', 'in the list of stop words'), to_tsquery('list &amp; stop'));
 ts_rank_cd
------------
       0.05

SELECT ts_rank_cd (to_tsvector('english', 'list stop words'), to_tsquery('list &amp; stop'));
 ts_rank_cd
------------
        0.1
</screen>

   </para>

   <para>
    It is up to the specific dictionary how it treats stop words. For example,
    <literal>ispell</literal> dictionaries first normalize words and then
    look at the list of stop words, while <literal>Snowball</literal> stemmers
    first check the list of stop words. The reason for the different
    behavior is an attempt to decrease noise.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-simple-dictionary">
   <title>Simple Dictionary</title>

   <para>
    The <literal>simple</literal> dictionary template operates by converting the
    input token to lower case and checking it against a file of stop words.
    If it is found in the file then an empty array is returned, causing
    the token to be discarded.  If not, the lower-cased form of the word
    is returned as the normalized lexeme.  Alternatively, the dictionary
    can be configured to report non-stop-words as unrecognized, allowing
    them to be passed on to the next dictionary in the list.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example of a dictionary definition using the <literal>simple</literal>
    template:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY public.simple_dict (
    TEMPLATE = pg_catalog.simple,
    STOPWORDS = english
);
</programlisting>

    Here, <literal>english</literal> is the base name of a file of stop words.
    The file's full name will be
    <filename>$SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/english.stop</filename>,
    where <literal>$SHAREDIR</literal> means the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation's shared-data directory,
    often <filename>/usr/local/share/postgresql</filename> (use <command>pg_config
    --sharedir</command> to determine it if you're not sure).
    The file format is simply a list
    of words, one per line.  Blank lines and trailing spaces are ignored,
    and upper case is folded to lower case, but no other processing is done
    on the file contents.
   </para>

   <para>
    Now we can test our dictionary:

<screen>
SELECT ts_lexize('public.simple_dict', 'YeS');
 ts_lexize
-----------
 {yes}

SELECT ts_lexize('public.simple_dict', 'The');
 ts_lexize
-----------
 {}
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    We can also choose to return <literal>NULL</literal>, instead of the lower-cased
    word, if it is not found in the stop words file.  This behavior is
    selected by setting the dictionary's <literal>Accept</literal> parameter to
    <literal>false</literal>.  Continuing the example:

<screen>
ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY public.simple_dict ( Accept = false );

SELECT ts_lexize('public.simple_dict', 'YeS');
 ts_lexize
-----------


SELECT ts_lexize('public.simple_dict', 'The');
 ts_lexize
-----------
 {}
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    With the default setting of <literal>Accept</literal> = <literal>true</literal>,
    it is only useful to place a <literal>simple</literal> dictionary at the end
    of a list of dictionaries, since it will never pass on any token to
    a following dictionary.  Conversely, <literal>Accept</literal> = <literal>false</literal>
    is only useful when there is at least one following dictionary.
   </para>

   <caution>
    <para>
     Most types of dictionaries rely on configuration files, such as files of
     stop words.  These files <emphasis>must</emphasis> be stored in UTF-8 encoding.
     They will be translated to the actual database encoding, if that is
     different, when they are read into the server.
    </para>
   </caution>

   <caution>
    <para>
     Normally, a database session will read a dictionary configuration file
     only once, when it is first used within the session.  If you modify a
     configuration file and want to force existing sessions to pick up the
     new contents, issue an <command>ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY</command> command
     on the dictionary.  This can be a <quote>dummy</quote> update that doesn't
     actually change any parameter values.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="textsearch-synonym-dictionary">
   <title>Synonym Dictionary</title>

   <para>
    This dictionary template is used to create dictionaries that replace a
    word with a synonym. Phrases are not supported (use the thesaurus
    template (<xref linkend="textsearch-thesaurus"/>) for that).  A synonym
    dictionary can be used to overcome linguistic problems, for example, to
    prevent an English stemmer dictionary from reducing the word <quote>Paris</quote> to
    <quote>pari</quote>.  It is enough to have a <literal>Paris paris</literal> line in the
    synonym dictionary and put it before the <literal>english_stem</literal>
    dictionary.  For example:

<screen>
SELECT * FROM ts_debug('english', 'Paris');
   alias   |   description   | token |  dictionaries  |  dictionary  | lexemes
-----------+-----------------+-------+----------------+--------------+---------
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | Paris | {english_stem} | english_stem | {pari}

CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY my_synonym (
    TEMPLATE = synonym,
    SYNONYMS = my_synonyms
);

ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION english
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword
    WITH my_synonym, english_stem;

SELECT * FROM ts_debug('english', 'Paris');
   alias   |   description   | token |       dictionaries        | dictionary | lexemes
-----------+-----------------+-------+---------------------------+------------+---------
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | Paris | {my_synonym,english_stem} | my_synonym | {paris}
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    The only parameter required by the <literal>synonym</literal> template is
    <literal>SYNONYMS</literal>, which is the base name of its configuration file
    &mdash; <literal>my_synonyms</literal> in the above example.
    The file's full name will be
    <filename>$SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/my_synonyms.syn</filename>
    (where <literal>$SHAREDIR</literal> means the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation's shared-data directory).
    The file format is just one line
    per word to be substituted, with the word followed by its synonym,
    separated by white space.  Blank lines and trailing spaces are ignored.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>synonym</literal> template also has an optional parameter
    <literal>CaseSensitive</literal>, which defaults to <literal>false</literal>.  When
    <literal>CaseSensitive</literal> is <literal>false</literal>, words in the synonym file
    are folded to lower case, as are input tokens.  When it is
    <literal>true</literal>, words and tokens are not folded to lower case,
    but are compared as-is.
   </para>

   <para>
    An asterisk (<literal>*</literal>) can be placed at the end of a synonym
    in the configuration file.  This indicates that the synonym is a prefix.
    The asterisk is ignored when the entry is used in
    <function>to_tsvector()</function>, but when it is used in
    <function>to_tsquery()</function>, the result will be a query item with
    the prefix match marker (see
    <xref linkend="textsearch-parsing-queries"/>).
    For example, suppose we have these entries in
    <filename>$SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/synonym_sample.syn</filename>:
<programlisting>
postgres        pgsql
postgresql      pgsql
postgre pgsql
gogle   googl
indices index*
</programlisting>
    Then we will get these results:
<screen>
mydb=# CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY syn (template=synonym, synonyms='synonym_sample');
mydb=# SELECT ts_lexize('syn', 'indices');
 ts_lexize

   <title>Thesaurus Dictionary</title>

   <para>
    A thesaurus dictionary (sometimes abbreviated as <acronym>TZ</acronym>) is
    a collection of words that includes information about the relationships
    of words and phrases, i.e., broader terms (<acronym>BT</acronym>), narrower
    terms (<acronym>NT</acronym>), preferred terms, non-preferred terms, related
    terms, etc.
   </para>

   <para>
    Basically a thesaurus dictionary replaces all non-preferred terms by one
    preferred term and, optionally, preserves the original terms for indexing
    as well.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s current implementation of the
    thesaurus dictionary is an extension of the synonym dictionary with added
    <firstterm>phrase</firstterm> support.  A thesaurus dictionary requires
    a configuration file of the following format:

<programlisting>
# this is a comment
sample word(s) : indexed word(s)
more sample word(s) : more indexed word(s)
...
</programlisting>

    where  the colon (<symbol>:</symbol>) symbol acts as a delimiter between a
    phrase and its replacement.
   </para>

   <para>
    A thesaurus dictionary uses a <firstterm>subdictionary</firstterm> (which
    is specified in the dictionary's configuration) to normalize the input
    text before checking for phrase matches. It is only possible to select one
    subdictionary.  An error is reported if the subdictionary fails to
    recognize a word. In that case, you should remove the use of the word or
    teach the subdictionary about it.  You can place an asterisk
    (<symbol>*</symbol>) at the beginning of an indexed word to skip applying
    the subdictionary to it, but all sample words <emphasis>must</emphasis> be known
    to the subdictionary.
   </para>

   <para>
    The thesaurus dictionary chooses the longest match if there are multiple
    phrases matching the input, and ties are broken by using the last
    definition.
   </para>

   <para>
    Specific stop words recognized by the subdictionary cannot be
    specified;  instead use <literal>?</literal> to mark the location where any
    stop word can appear.  For example, assuming that <literal>a</literal> and
    <literal>the</literal> are stop words according to the subdictionary:

<programlisting>
? one ? two : swsw
</programlisting>

    matches <literal>a one the two</literal> and <literal>the one a two</literal>;
    both would be replaced by <literal>swsw</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since a thesaurus dictionary has the capability to recognize phrases it
    must remember its state and interact with the parser. A thesaurus dictionary
    uses these assignments to check if it should handle the next word or stop
    accumulation.  The thesaurus dictionary must be configured
    carefully. For example, if the thesaurus dictionary is assigned to handle
    only the <literal>asciiword</literal> token, then a thesaurus dictionary
    definition like <literal>one 7</literal> will not work since token type
    <literal>uint</literal> is not assigned to the thesaurus dictionary.
   </para>

   <caution>
    <para>
     Thesauruses are used during indexing so any change in the thesaurus
     dictionary's parameters <emphasis>requires</emphasis> reindexing.
     For most other dictionary types, small changes such as adding or
     removing stopwords does not force reindexing.
    </para>
   </caution>

  <sect3 id="textsearch-thesaurus-config">
   <title>Thesaurus Configuration</title>

   <para>
    To define a new thesaurus dictionary, use the <literal>thesaurus</literal>
    template.  For example:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY thesaurus_simple (
    TEMPLATE = thesaurus,
    DictFile = mythesaurus,
    Dictionary = pg_catalog.english_stem
);
</programlisting>

    Here:
    <itemizedlist  spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>thesaurus_simple</literal> is the new dictionary's name
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>mythesaurus</literal> is the base name of the thesaurus
       configuration file.
       (Its full name will be <filename>$SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/mythesaurus.ths</filename>,
       where <literal>$SHAREDIR</literal> means the installation shared-data
       directory.)
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>pg_catalog.english_stem</literal> is the subdictionary (here,
       a Snowball English stemmer) to use for thesaurus normalization.
       Notice that the subdictionary will have its own
       configuration (for example, stop words), which is not shown here.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    Now it is possible to bind the thesaurus dictionary <literal>thesaurus_simple</literal>
    to the desired token types in a configuration, for example:

<programlisting>
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION russian
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart
    WITH thesaurus_simple;
</programlisting>
   </para>

  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="textsearch-thesaurus-examples">
   <title>Thesaurus Example</title>

   <para>
    Consider a simple astronomical thesaurus <literal>thesaurus_astro</literal>,
    which contains some astronomical word combinations:

<programlisting>
supernovae stars : sn
crab nebulae : crab
</programlisting>

    Below we create a dictionary and bind some token types to
    an astronomical thesaurus and English stemmer:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY thesaurus_astro (
    TEMPLATE = thesaurus,
    DictFile = thesaurus_astro,
    Dictionary = english_stem
);

ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION russian
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart
    WITH thesaurus_astro, english_stem;
</programlisting>

    Now we can see how it works.
    <function>ts_lexize</function> is not very useful for testing a thesaurus,
    because it treats its input as a single token.  Instead we can use
    <function>plainto_tsquery</function> and <function>to_tsvector</function>
    which will break their input strings into multiple tokens:

<screen>
SELECT plainto_tsquery('supernova star');
 plainto_tsquery
-----------------
 'sn'

SELECT to_tsvector('supernova star');
 to_tsvector
-------------
 'sn':1
</screen>

    In principle, one can use <function>to_tsquery</function> if you quote
    the argument:

<screen>
SELECT to_tsquery('''supernova star''');
 to_tsquery
------------
 'sn'
</screen>

    Notice that <literal>supernova star</literal> matches <literal>supernovae
    stars</literal> in <literal>thesaurus_astro</literal> because we specified
    the <literal>english_stem</literal> stemmer in the thesaurus definition.
    The stemmer removed the <literal>e</literal> and <literal>s</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    To index the original phrase as well as the substitute, just include it
    in the right-hand part of the definition:

<screen>
supernovae stars : sn supernovae stars

SELECT plainto_tsquery('supernova star');
       plainto_tsquery
-----------------------------
 'sn' &amp; 'supernova' &amp; 'star'

  <sect2 id="textsearch-snowball-dictionary">
   <title><application>Snowball</application> Dictionary</title>

   <para>
    The <application>Snowball</application> dictionary template is based on a project
    by Martin Porter, inventor of the popular Porter's stemming algorithm
    for the English language.  Snowball now provides stemming algorithms for
    many languages (see the <ulink url="https://snowballstem.org/">Snowball
    site</ulink> for more information).  Each algorithm understands how to
    reduce common variant forms of words to a base, or stem, spelling within
    its language.  A Snowball dictionary requires a <literal>language</literal>
    parameter to identify which stemmer to use, and optionally can specify a
    <literal>stopword</literal> file name that gives a list of words to eliminate.
    (<productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s standard stopword lists are also
    provided by the Snowball project.)
    For example, there is a built-in definition equivalent to

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_stem (
    TEMPLATE = snowball,
    Language = english,
    StopWords = english
);
</programlisting>

    The stopword file format is the same as already explained.
   </para>

   <para>
    A <application>Snowball</application> dictionary recognizes everything, whether
    or not it is able to simplify the word, so it should be placed
    at the end of the dictionary list. It is useless to have it
    before any other dictionary because a token will never pass through it to
    the next dictionary.
   </para>

  </sect2>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="textsearch-configuration">
  <title>Configuration Example</title>

   <para>
    A text search configuration specifies all options necessary to transform a
    document into a <type>tsvector</type>: the parser to use to break text
    into tokens, and the dictionaries to use to transform each token into a
    lexeme.  Every call of
    <function>to_tsvector</function> or <function>to_tsquery</function>
    needs a text search configuration to perform its processing.
    The configuration parameter
    <xref linkend="guc-default-text-search-config"/>
    specifies the name of the default configuration, which is the
    one used by text search functions if an explicit configuration
    parameter is omitted.
    It can be set in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, or set for an
    individual session using the <command>SET</command> command.
   </para>

   <para>
    Several predefined text search configurations are available, and
    you can create custom configurations easily.  To facilitate management
    of text search objects, a set of <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands
    is available, and there are several <application>psql</application> commands that display information
    about text search objects (<xref linkend="textsearch-psql"/>).
   </para>

   <para>
    As an example we will create a configuration
    <literal>pg</literal>, starting by duplicating the built-in
    <literal>english</literal> configuration:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.pg ( COPY = pg_catalog.english );
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    We will use a PostgreSQL-specific synonym list
    and store it in <filename>$SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/pg_dict.syn</filename>.
    The file contents look like:

<programlisting>
postgres    pg
pgsql       pg
postgresql  pg
</programlisting>

    We define the synonym dictionary like this:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY pg_dict (
    TEMPLATE = synonym,
    SYNONYMS = pg_dict
);
</programlisting>

    Next we register the <productname>Ispell</productname> dictionary
    <literal>english_ispell</literal>, which has its own configuration files:

<programlisting>
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_ispell (
    TEMPLATE = ispell,
    DictFile = english,
    AffFile = english,
    StopWords = english
);
</programlisting>

    Now we can set up the mappings for words in configuration
    <literal>pg</literal>:

  <para>
   In this example, the word <literal>Brightest</literal> was recognized by the
   parser as an <literal>ASCII word</literal> (alias <literal>asciiword</literal>).
   For this token type the dictionary list is
   <literal>english_ispell</literal> and
   <literal>english_stem</literal>. The word was recognized by
   <literal>english_ispell</literal>, which reduced it to the noun
   <literal>bright</literal>. The word <literal>supernovaes</literal> is
   unknown to the <literal>english_ispell</literal> dictionary so it
   was passed to the next dictionary, and, fortunately, was recognized (in
   fact, <literal>english_stem</literal> is a Snowball dictionary which
   recognizes everything; that is why it was placed at the end of the
   dictionary list).
  </para>

  <para>
   The word <literal>The</literal> was recognized by the
   <literal>english_ispell</literal> dictionary as a stop word (<xref
   linkend="textsearch-stopwords"/>) and will not be indexed.
   The spaces are discarded too, since the configuration provides no
   dictionaries at all for them.

     <listitem>
      <para>

       signature length in bytes (see below for details).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   </variablelist>
  </para>

  <para>
   GIN indexes are the preferred text search index type.  As inverted
   indexes, they contain an index entry for each word (lexeme), with a
   compressed list of matching locations.  Multi-word searches can find
   the first match, then use the index to remove rows that are lacking
   additional words.  GIN indexes store only the words (lexemes) of
   <type>tsvector</type> values, and not their weight labels.  Thus a table
   row recheck is needed when using a query that involves weights.
  </para>

  <para>
   A GiST index is <firstterm>lossy</firstterm>, meaning that the index
   might produce false matches, and it is necessary
   to check the actual table row to eliminate such false matches.
   (<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> does this automatically when needed.)
   GiST indexes are lossy because each document is represented in the
   index by a fixed-length signature.  The signature length in bytes is determined
   by the value of the optional integer parameter <literal>siglen</literal>.
   The default signature length (when <literal>siglen</literal> is not specified) is
   124 bytes, the maximum signature length is 2024 bytes. The signature is generated by hashing
   each word into a single bit in an n-bit string, with all these bits OR-ed
   together to produce an n-bit document signature.  When two words hash to
   the same bit position there will be a false match.  If all words in
   the query have matches (real or false) then the table row must be
   retrieved to see if the match is correct.  Longer signatures lead to a more
   precise search (scanning a smaller fraction of the index and fewer heap
   pages), at the cost of a larger index.
  </para>

  <para>
   A GiST index can be covering, i.e., use the <literal>INCLUDE</literal>
   clause.  Included columns can have data types without any GiST operator
   class.  Included attributes will be stored uncompressed.
  </para>

  <para>
   Lossiness causes performance degradation due to unnecessary fetches of table
   records that turn out to be false matches.  Since random access to table
   records is slow, this limits the usefulness of GiST indexes.  The
   likelihood of false matches depends on several factors, in particular the
   number of unique words, so using dictionaries to reduce this number is
   recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
   Note that <acronym>GIN</acronym> index build time can often be improved
   by increasing <xref linkend="guc-maintenance-work-mem"/>, while
   <acronym>GiST</acronym> index build time is not sensitive to that
   parameter.
  </para>

  <para>
   Partitioning of big collections and the proper use of GIN and GiST indexes
   allows the implementation of very fast searches with online update.
   Partitioning can be done at the database level using table inheritance,
   or by distributing documents over
   servers and collecting external search results, e.g., via <link
   linkend="ddl-foreign-data">Foreign Data</link> access.
   The latter is possible because ranking functions use
   only local information.
