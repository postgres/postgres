   <title>Migration to Version 8.2.23</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, a longstanding error was discovered in the definition of the
    <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view.  If you
    rely on correct results from that view, you should replace its
    definition as explained in the first changelog item below.
   </para>

    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.14,
    see <xref linkend="release-8-2-14">.

     <para>
      Fix bugs in <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the view definition is installed by <application>initdb</>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this
      in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the
      <literal>information_schema</> schema then re-create it by sourcing
      <filename><replaceable>SHAREDIR</>/information_schema.sql</filename>.
      (Run <literal>pg_config --sharedir</> if you're uncertain where
      <replaceable>SHAREDIR</> is.)  This must be repeated in each database
      to be fixed.

      Fix TOAST-related data corruption during <literal>CREATE TABLE dest AS

      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a table has been modified by <command>ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</>,
      attempts to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce
      corrupt results in certain corner cases.
      The problem can only manifest in this precise form in 8.4 and later,
      but we patched earlier versions as well in case there are other code
      paths that could trigger the same bug.

      Fix race condition during toast table access from stale syscache entries
      (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      The typical symptom was transient errors like <quote>missing chunk
      number 0 for toast value NNNNN in pg_toast_2619</>, where the cited
      toast table would always belong to a system catalog.

      Improve locale support in <type>money</> type's input and output

     <para>
      Aside from not supporting all standard
      <link linkend="guc-lc-monetary"><varname>lc_monetary</></link>
      formatting options, the input and output functions were inconsistent,
      meaning there were locales in which dumped <type>money</> values could

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <varname>transform_null_equals</> is only supposed to affect
      <literal>foo = NULL</> expressions written directly by the user, not
      equality checks generated internally by this form of <literal>CASE</>.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</> trigger and the
      <literal>CHECK</> trigger as one event.  The <literal>ON UPDATE</>
      trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

     <para>
      There was a window wherein a new backend process could read a stale init

      Commands that perform many separate GiST index scans, such as

      Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl and
      PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by subverting
      Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same session under
      another SQL user identity (for example, within a <literal>SECURITY
      DEFINER</> function).  Most scripting languages offer numerous ways that
      that might be done, such as redefining standard functions or operators
      called by the target function.  Without this change, any SQL user with
      Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with the
      SQL privileges of the target function's owner.
     </para>

     <para>
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among Perl
      and Tcl functions becomes more difficult.  To provide an escape hatch,
      PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one interpreter
      per session.  This is not considered a security issue since all such
      functions execute at the trust level of a database superuser already.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to offer
      trusted execution have similar security issues.  We advise contacting
      the authors of any PL you are depending on for security-critical
      purposes.

      Enforce restrictions in <literal>plperl</> using an opmask applied to
      the whole interpreter, instead of using <filename>Safe.pm</>
      (Tim Bunce, Andrew Dunstan)
     </para>

     <para>
      Recent developments have convinced us that <filename>Safe.pm</> is too
      insecure to rely on for making <literal>plperl</> trustable.  This
      change removes use of <filename>Safe.pm</> altogether, in favor of using
      a separate interpreter with an opcode mask that is always applied.
      Pleasant side effects of the change include that it is now possible to
      use Perl's <literal>strict</> pragma in a natural way in
      <literal>plperl</>, and that Perl's <literal>$a</> and <literal>$b</>
      variables work as expected in sort routines, and that function
      compilation is significantly faster.  (CVE-2010-1169)

      Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from

     <para>
      PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from a database table
      could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks, because there was no
      restriction on who could create or insert into that table.  This change
      disables the feature unless <structname>pltcl_modules</> is owned by a
      superuser.  (However, the permissions on the table are not checked, so
      installations that really need a less-than-secure modules table can
      still grant suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.)  Also,
      prevent loading code into the unrestricted <quote>normal</> Tcl
      interpreter unless we are really going to execute a <literal>pltclu</>
      function.  (CVE-2010-1170)

      Add new configuration parameter <varname>ssl_renegotiation_limit</> to
      control how often we do session key renegotiation for an SSL connection
      (Magnus)
     </para>

     <para>
      This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which may
      be required if a broken SSL library is used.  In particular, some
      vendors are shipping stopgap patches for CVE-2009-3555 that cause
      renegotiation attempts to fail.

      Fix incorrect WAL data emitted during end-of-recovery cleanup of a GIST
      index page split (Yoichi Hirai)
     </para>

     <para>
      This would result in index corruption, or even more likely an error
      during WAL replay, if we were unlucky enough to crash during
      end-of-recovery cleanup after having completed an incomplete GIST
      insertion.

     </para>

     <para>
      The previous coding treated only -1 that way, and would produce an
      invalid result value for other negative values, possibly leading to
      a crash (CVE-2010-0442).

      as a file inclusion request (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts with
      <literal>@</>.  If you need to include a file whose path name
      contains spaces, you can still do so, but you must write
      <literal>@"/path to/file"</> rather than putting the quotes around
      the whole construct.

      It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow the checkpoint

      The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the Linux

      Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
      related failure scenarios.  The previous fixes were narrowly tailored
      for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that
      <emphasis>any</> error thrown by an encoding conversion function could
      potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the
      error.  The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding
      conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message,
      if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

     <para>
      This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion failure.
      The previous change is a backstop to guard against other kinds of
      failures in the same area.

     <para>
      If <command>CLUSTER</> or a rewriting variant of <command>ALTER TABLE</>
      were executed by someone other than the table owner, the
      <structname>pg_type</> entry for the table's TOAST table would end up
      marked as owned by that someone.  This caused no immediate problems,
      since the permissions on the TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any
      ordinary database operation.  However, it could lead to unexpected
      failures if one later tried to drop the role that issued the command
      (in 8.1 or 8.2), or <quote>owner of data type appears to be invalid</>

      Make <function>pg_get_ruledef()</> parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be dumped
      as, say, <literal>-42::integer</>, which is subtly incorrect: it should
      be <literal>(-42)::integer</> due to operator precedence rules.
      Usually this would make little difference, but it could interact with
      another recent patch to cause
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> to reject what had been a valid
      <command>SELECT DISTINCT</> view query.  Since this could result in
      <application>pg_dump</> output failing to reload, it is being treated

      This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8
      database encoding.  The same fix was made for all other cases
      over two years ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code
      path that was not updated.  If you are using a locale that

      Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
      the user running <command>VACUUM</>, <command>ANALYZE</>, etc (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Functions used in index expressions and partial-index
      predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made.  It has
      long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code
      execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user.
      (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the
      same type of risk.)  But functions in indexes pose extra danger
      because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations
      such as <command>VACUUM FULL</>, which are commonly performed
      automatically under a superuser account.  For example, a nefarious user
      can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a
      trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum.
      The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations
      (including <command>VACUUM</>, <command>ANALYZE</>, <command>REINDEX</>,
      and <command>CLUSTER</>) to execute as the table owner rather than
      the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already
      used for <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</> functions.  To prevent bypassing
      this security measure, execution of <command>SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</> and <command>SET ROLE</> is now forbidden within a
      <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</> context.  (CVE-2007-6600)

      Remove security vulnerabilities that allowed connected users

      The vulnerabilities involve suppressing the normal check that a SQL

      data type of a table column (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556).  These
      errors can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in

   <title>Migration to Version 8.2</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore using <application>pg_dump</application> is
    required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.
   </para>

   <para>
    Observe the following incompatibilities:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Set <link
       linkend="guc-escape-string-warning"><varname>escape_string_warning</></link>
       to <literal>on</> by default (Bruce)
      </para>

      <para>
       This issues a warning if backslash escapes are used in
       <link linkend="sql-syntax-strings">non-escape (non-<literal>E''</>)
       strings</link>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Change the <link linkend="sql-syntax-row-constructors">row
       constructor syntax</link> (<literal>ROW(...)</>) so that
       list elements <literal>foo.*</> will be expanded to a list
       of their member fields, rather than creating a nested
       row type field as formerly (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       The new behavior is substantially more useful since it
       allows, for example, triggers to check for data changes
       with <literal>IF row(new.*) IS DISTINCT FROM row(old.*)</>.
       The old behavior is still available by omitting <literal>.*</>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make <link linkend="row-wise-comparison">row comparisons</link>
       follow <acronym>SQL</> standard semantics and allow them
       to be used in index scans (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       Previously, row = and &lt;&gt; comparisons followed the
       standard but &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= did not.  A row comparison
       can now be used as an index constraint for a multicolumn
       index matching the row value.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make <link linkend="functions-comparison">row <literal>IS <optional>NOT</> NULL</literal></link>
       tests follow <acronym>SQL</> standard semantics (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       The former behavior conformed to the standard for simple cases
       with <literal>IS NULL</>, but <literal>IS NOT NULL</> would return
       true if any row field was non-null, whereas the standard says it
       should return true only when all fields are non-null.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make <link linkend="SQL-SET-CONSTRAINTS"><command>SET
       CONSTRAINT</></link> affect only one constraint (Kris Jurka)
      </para>

      <para>
       In previous releases, <command>SET CONSTRAINT</> modified
       all constraints with a matching name.  In this release,
       the schema search path is used to modify only the first
       matching constraint.  A schema specification is also
       supported.  This more nearly conforms to the SQL standard.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Remove <literal>RULE</> permission for tables, for security reasons
       (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       As of this release, only a table's owner can create or modify
       rules for the table.  For backwards compatibility,
       <command>GRANT</>/<command>REVOKE RULE</> is still accepted,
       but it does nothing.

       Array comparison improvements (Tom)
      </para>

       Now array dimensions are also compared.

      <para>
       Change <link linkend="functions-array">array concatenation</link>
       to match documented behavior (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       This changes the previous behavior where concatenation
       would modify the array lower bound.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make command-line options of <application>postmaster</>
       and <link linkend="app-postgres"><application>postgres</></link>
       identical (Peter)
      </para>

      <para>
       This allows the postmaster to pass arguments to each backend
       without using <literal>-o</>.  Note that some options are now
       only available as long-form options, because there were conflicting
       single-letter options.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Deprecate use of <application>postmaster</> symbolic link (Peter)
      </para>

      <para>
       <application>postmaster</> and <application>postgres</>
       commands now act identically, with the behavior determined
       by command-line options.  The <application>postmaster</> symbolic link is
       kept for compatibility, but is not really needed.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Change <link
       linkend="guc-log-duration"><varname>log_duration</></link>
       to output even if the query is not output (Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       In prior releases, <varname>log_duration</> only printed if
       the query appeared earlier in the log.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make <link
       linkend="functions-formatting"><function>to_char(time)</></link>
       and <link
       linkend="functions-formatting"><function>to_char(interval)</></link>
       treat <literal>HH</> and <literal>HH12</> as 12-hour
       intervals
      </para>

      <para>
       Most applications should use <literal>HH24</> unless they
       want a 12-hour display.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Zero unmasked bits in conversion from <link
       linkend="datatype-inet"><type>INET</></link> to <link

      <note>
       <para>
        This also implies that data can no longer be shared between a PL/Perl
        function and a PL/PerlU function.
        Some Perl installations have not been compiled with the correct flags
        to allow multiple interpreters to exist within a single process.
        In this situation PL/Perl and PL/PerlU cannot both be used in a
        single backend. The solution is to get a Perl installation which
        supports multiple interpreters.

       Allow the planner to reorder <link linkend="queries-join">outer

      </para>

      <para>
       In previous releases, outer joins would always be evaluated in
       the order written in the query. This change allows the
       query optimizer to consider reordering outer joins, in cases where
       it can determine that the join order can be changed without
       altering the meaning of the query.  This can make a
       considerable performance difference for queries involving
       multiple outer joins or mixed inner and outer joins.

       A shell type declaration creates a type name, without specifying
