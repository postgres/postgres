 <title>Server Run-time Environment</title>

  This chapter discusses how to set up and run the database server
  and its interactions with the operating system.

  <title>The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> User Account</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>postgres user</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   As with any other server daemon that is accessible to the outside world,
   it is advisable to run <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> under a
   separate user account. This user account should only own the data
   that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other
   daemons. (For example, using the user <literal>nobody</literal> is a bad
   idea.) It is not advisable to install executables owned by this 
   user because compromised systems could then modify their own 
   binaries.
  </para>

  <para>
   To add a Unix user account to your system, look for a command
   <command>useradd</command> or <command>adduser</command>. The user
   name <systemitem>postgres</systemitem> is often used, and is assumed
   throughout this book, but you can use another name if you like.

  <title>Creating a Database Cluster</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>database cluster</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>data area</primary>
   <see>database cluster</see>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage
   area on disk. We call this a <firstterm>database cluster</firstterm>.
   (<acronym>SQL</acronym> uses the term catalog cluster.) A
   database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a
   single instance of a running database server. After initialization, a
   database cluster will contain a database named
   <literal>template1</literal>. As the name suggests, this will be used
   as a template for subsequently created databases; it should not be
   used for actual work.  (See <xref linkend="managing-databases"> for
   information about creating new databases within a cluster.)
  </para>

  <para>
   In file system terms, a database cluster will be a single directory
   under which all data will be stored. We call this the <firstterm>data
   directory</firstterm> or <firstterm>data area</firstterm>. It is
   completely up to you where you choose to store your data.  There is no
   default, although locations such as
   <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</filename> or
   <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename> are popular. To initialize a
   database cluster, use the command <xref
   linkend="app-initdb">,<indexterm><primary>initdb</></> which is
   installed with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. The desired
   file system location of your database cluster is indicated by the
   <option>-D</option> option, for example
<screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   Note that you must execute this command while logged into the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account, which is
   described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    As an alternative to the <option>-D</option> option, you can set
    the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
    <indexterm><primary><envar>PGDATA</envar></primary></indexterm>
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will attempt to create the directory you
   specify if it does not already exist. It is likely that it will not
   have the permission to do so (if you followed our advice and created
   an unprivileged account). In that case you should create the
   directory yourself (as root) and change the owner to be the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user. Here is how this might
   be done:
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>su postgres</userinput>
postgres$ <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will refuse to run if the data directory
   looks like it has already been initialized.</para>

  <para>
   Because the data directory contains all the data stored in the
   database, it is essential that it be secured from unauthorized
   access. <command>initdb</command> therefore revokes access
   permissions from everyone but the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user.
  </para>

  <para>
   However, while the directory contents are secure, the default
   client authentication setup allows any local user to connect to the
   database and even become the database superuser. If you do not
   trust other local users, we recommend you use one of
   <command>initdb</command>'s <option>-W</option>, <option>--pwprompt</option>
   or <option>--pwfile</option> options to assign a password to the
   database superuser.<indexterm><primary>password</><secondary>of the
   superuser</></indexterm>  Also, specify <option>-A md5</> or
   <option>-A password</> so that the default <literal>trust</> authentication
   mode is not used; or modify the generated <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
   file after running <command>initdb</command>,
   <emphasis>before</> you start the server for the first time. (Other
   reasonable approaches include using <literal>ident</literal> authentication
   or file system permissions to restrict connections. See <xref
   linkend="client-authentication"> for more information.)
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> also initializes the default
   locale<indexterm><primary>locale</></> for the database cluster.
   Normally, it will just take the locale settings in the environment
   and apply them to the initialized database.  It is possible to
   specify a different locale for the database; more information about
   that can be found in <xref linkend="locale">.  The sort order used
   within a particular database cluster is set by
   <command>initdb</command> and cannot be changed later, short of
   dumping all data, rerunning <command>initdb</command>, and reloading
   the data. There is also a performance impact for using locales
   other than <literal>C</> or <literal>POSIX</>. Therefore, it is
   important to make this choice correctly the first time.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> also sets the default character set encoding
   for the database cluster.  Normally this should be chosen to match the
   locale setting.  For details see <xref linkend="multibyte">.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="postmaster-start">
  <title>Starting the Database Server</title>

  <para>
   Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database
   server. The database server program is called
   <command>postmaster</command>.<indexterm><primary>postmaster</></>
   The <command>postmaster</command> must know where to
   find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the
   <option>-D</option> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the
   server is:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be
   done while logged into the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user
   account. Without <option>-D</option>, the server will try to use
   the data directory named by the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
   If that variable is not provided either, it will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally it is better to start the <command>postmaster</command> in the
   background.  For this, use the usual shell syntax:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</userinput>
</screen>
   It is important to store the server's <systemitem>stdout</> and
   <systemitem>stderr</> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help
   for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <xref
   linkend="logfile-maintenance"> for a more thorough discussion of log
   file handling.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The <command>postmaster</command> also takes a number of other
   command line options. For more information, see the
   <xref linkend="app-postmaster"> reference page
   and <xref linkend="runtime-config"> below.
  </para>

  <para>
   This shell syntax can get tedious quickly.  Therefore the wrapper
   program
   <xref linkend="app-pg-ctl"><indexterm><primary>pg_ctl</primary></indexterm>
   is provided to simplify some tasks.  For example:
<programlisting>
pg_ctl start -l logfile
</programlisting>
   will start the server in the background and put the output into the
   named log file. The <option>-D</option> option has the same meaning
   here as in the <command>postmaster</command>. <command>pg_ctl</command>
   is also capable of stopping the server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots.<indexterm><primary>booting</><secondary>starting
   the server during</></> Autostart scripts are operating-system-specific.
   There are a few distributed with
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> in the
   <filename>contrib/start-scripts</> directory. Installing one will require
   root privileges.
  </para>

  <para>
   Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons
   at boot time. Many systems have a file
   <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>. Others use
   <filename>rc.d</> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be
   run by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account
   <emphasis>and not by root</emphasis> or any other user. Therefore you
   probably should form your commands using <literal>su -c '...'
   postgres</literal>.  For example:
<programlisting>
su -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog' postgres
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Here are a few more operating-system-specific suggestions. (In each
   case be sure to use the proper installation directory and user
   name where we show generic values.)

     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

  </para>

   <para>
    While the <command>postmaster</command> is running, its
    <acronym>PID</acronym> is stored in the file
    <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. This is
    used to prevent multiple <command>postmaster</command> processes
    running in the same data directory and can also be used for
    shutting down the <command>postmaster</command> process.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="postmaster-start-failures">
    <title>Server Start-up Failures</title>

    <para>
     There are several common reasons the server might fail to
     start. Check the server's log file, or start it by hand (without
     redirecting standard output or standard error) and see what error
     messages appear. Below we explain some of the most common error
     messages in more detail.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
     This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start
     another <command>postmaster</command> on the same port where one is already running.
     However, if the kernel error message is not <computeroutput>Address
     already in use</computeroutput> or some variant of that, there may
     be a different problem. For example, trying to start a <command>postmaster</command>
     on a reserved port number may draw something like:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -p 666</userinput>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Permission denied
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 666? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     A message like
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument
DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5440001, size=4011376640, 03600).
</screen>
     probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is
     smaller than the work area <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
     is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you
     can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number
     of buffers (<option>-B</option> switch). You will eventually want
     to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory
     size. You may also see this message when trying to start multiple
     servers on the same machine, if their total space requested
     exceeds the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     An error like
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create semaphores: No space left on device
DETAIL:  Failed system call was semget(5440126, 17, 03600).
</screen>
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean you've run out of disk
     space. It means your kernel's limit on the number of <systemitem
     class="osname">System V</> semaphores is smaller than the number
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> wants to create. As above,
     you may be able to work around the problem by starting the
     server with a reduced number of allowed connections
     (<option>-N</option> switch), but you'll eventually want to
     increase the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you get an <quote>illegal system call</> error, it is likely that
     shared memory or semaphores are not supported in your kernel at
     all. In that case your only option is to reconfigure the kernel to
     enable these features.
    </para>

    <para>
     Details about configuring <systemitem class="osname">System V</>
     <acronym>IPC</> facilities are given in <xref linkend="sysvipc">.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="client-connection-problems">
    <title>Client Connection Problems</title>

    <para>
     Although the error conditions possible on the client side are quite
     varied and application-dependent, a few of them might be directly
     related to how the server was started up. Conditions other than
     those shown below should be documented with the respective client
     application.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "server.joe.com" and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
</screen>
     This is the generic <quote>I couldn't find a server to talk
     to</quote> failure. It looks like the above when TCP/IP
     communication is attempted. A common mistake is to forget to
     configure the server to allow TCP/IP connections.
    </para>

    <para>
     Alternatively, you'll get this when attempting Unix-domain socket
     communication to a local server:
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to
     connect to the right place. If there is in fact no server
     running there, the kernel error message will typically be either
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> or
     <computeroutput>No such file or directory</computeroutput>, as
     illustrated. (It is important to realize that
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> in this context
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that the server got your
     connection request and rejected it. That case will produce a
     different message, as shown in <xref
     linkend="client-authentication-problems">.) Other error messages
     such as <computeroutput>Connection timed out</computeroutput> may
     indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network
     connectivity.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="runtime-config">
   <title>Run-time Configuration</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>configuration</primary>
    <secondary>of the server</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    There are a lot of configuration parameters that affect the
    behavior of the database system. In this subsection, we describe
    how to set configuration parameters; the following subsections
    discuss each parameter in detail.
   </para>

   <para>
    All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
    value of one of four types: boolean, integer, floating point,
    or string. Boolean values may be written as <literal>ON</literal>,
    <literal>OFF</literal>, <literal>TRUE</literal>,
    <literal>FALSE</literal>, <literal>YES</literal>,
    <literal>NO</literal>, <literal>1</literal>, <literal>0</literal>
    (all case-insensitive) or any unambiguous prefix of these.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to set these parameters is to edit the file
    <filename>postgresql.conf</><indexterm><primary>postgresql.conf</></>,
    which is normally kept in the data directory. (<command>initdb</>
    installs a default copy there.) An example of what this file might look
    like is:
<programlisting>
# This is a comment
log_connections = yes
log_destination = 'syslog'
search_path = '$user, public'
</programlisting>
    One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
    value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant and blank lines are
    ignored. Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) introduce comments
    anywhere.  Parameter values that are not simple identifiers or
    numbers must be single-quoted.
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm>
     <primary>SIGHUP</primary>
    </indexterm>
    The configuration file is reread whenever the
    <command>postmaster</command> process receives a
    <systemitem>SIGHUP</> signal (which is most easily sent by means
    of <literal>pg_ctl reload</>). The <command>postmaster</command>
    also propagates this signal to all currently running server
    processes so that existing sessions also get the new
    value. Alternatively, you can send the signal to a single server
    process directly.  Some parameters can only be set at server start;
    any changes to their entries in the configuration file will be ignored
    until the server is restarted.
   </para>

   <para>
    A second way to set these configuration parameters is to give them
    as a command line option to the <command>postmaster</command>, such as:
<programlisting>
postmaster -c log_connections=yes -c log_destination='syslog'
</programlisting>
    Command-line options override any conflicting settings in
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.  Note that this means you won't
    be able to change the value on-the-fly by editing
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, so while the command-line
    method may be convenient, it can cost you flexibility later.
   </para>

   <para>
    Occasionally it is useful to give a command line option to
    one particular session only. The environment variable
    <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> can be used for this purpose on the
    client side:
<programlisting>
env PGOPTIONS='-c geqo=off' psql
</programlisting>
    (This works for any <application>libpq</>-based client application, not
    just <application>psql</application>.) Note that this won't work for
    parameters that are fixed when the server is started or that must be
    specified in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Furthermore, it is possible to assign a set of option settings to
    a user or a database.  Whenever a session is started, the default
    settings for the user and database involved are loaded.  The
    commands <xref linkend="sql-alteruser" endterm="sql-alteruser-title">
    and <xref linkend="sql-alterdatabase" endterm="sql-alterdatabase-title">,
    respectively, are used to configure these settings.  Per-database
    settings override anything received from the
    <command>postmaster</command> command-line or the configuration
    file, and in turn are overridden by per-user settings; both are
    overridden by per-session options.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some parameters can be changed in individual <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    sessions with the <xref linkend="SQL-SET" endterm="SQL-SET-title">
    command, for example:
<screen>
SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;
</screen>
    If <command>SET</> is allowed, it overrides all other sources of
    values for the parameter. Some parameters cannot be changed via
    <command>SET</command>: for example, if they control behavior that
    cannot reasonably be changed without restarting
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  Also, some parameters can
    be modified via <command>SET</command> or <command>ALTER</> by superusers,
    but not by ordinary users.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <xref linkend="SQL-SHOW" endterm="SQL-SHOW-title">
    command allows inspection of the current values of all parameters.
   </para>

   <para>
    The virtual table <structname>pg_settings</structname>
    (described in <xref linkend="view-pg-settings">) also allows
    displaying and updating session run-time parameters.  It is equivalent
    to <command>SHOW</> and <command>SET</>, but can be more convenient
    to use because it can be joined with other tables, or selected from using
    any desired selection condition.
   </para>
    
   <sect2 id="runtime-config-file-locations">
    <title>File Locations</title>

     <para>
      In addition to the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file
      already mentioned, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses
      two other manually-edited configuration files, which control
      client authentication (their use is discussed in <xref
      linkend="client-authentication">).
      By default, all three configuration files are stored
      in the database cluster's data directory.  The options described
      in this subsection allow the configuration files to be placed elsewhere.
      (Doing so can ease administration.  In particular it is often
      easier to ensure that the configuration files are properly backed-up
      when they are kept separate.)

        enforced by the kernel (as set by <literal>ulimit -s</> or local
        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety
        margin is needed because the stack depth is not checked in every
        routine in the server, but only in key potentially-recursive routines
        such as expression evaluation.  Setting the parameter higher than
        the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function
        can crash an individual backend process.  The default setting is
        2048 KB (two megabytes), which is conservatively small and unlikely

        By preloading a shared library (and initializing it if
        applicable), the library startup time is avoided when the
        library is first used.  However, the time to start each new
        server process may increase slightly, even if that process never

     <title>Background Writer</title>

     <para>
      Beginning in <productname>PostgreSQL</> 8.0, there is a separate server
      process called the <firstterm>background writer</>, whose sole function
      is to issue writes of <quote>dirty</> shared buffers.  The intent is
      that server processes handling user queries should seldom or never have
      to wait for a write to occur, because the background writer will do it.
      This arrangement also reduces the performance penalty associated with
      checkpoints.  The background writer will continuously trickle out dirty
      pages to disk, so that only a few pages will need to be forced out when
      checkpoint time arrives, instead of the storm of dirty-buffer writes that
      formerly occurred at each checkpoint.  However there is a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because where a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      before have been written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times in the same interval.
      In most situations a continuous low load is preferable to periodic
      spikes, but the parameters discussed in this section can be used to tune
      the behavior for local needs.

       <para>

        writes. This can result in significantly improved performance.
        However, if the system crashes, the results of the last few
        committed transactions may be lost in part or whole. In the
        worst case, unrecoverable data corruption may occur.
        (Crashes of the database server itself are <emphasis>not</>

        Time delay between writing a commit record to the WAL buffer
        and flushing the buffer out to disk, in microseconds. A
        nonzero delay can allow multiple transactions to be committed
        with only one <function>fsync()</function> system call, if
        system load is high enough that additional transactions become
        ready to commit within the given interval. But the delay is
        just wasted if no other transactions become ready to
        commit. Therefore, the delay is only performed if at least
        <varname>commit_siblings</varname> other transactions are
        active at the instant that a server process has written its
        commit record. The default is zero (no delay).

       These configuration parameters provide a crude method of
       influencing the query plans chosen by the query optimizer. If

        Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the
        disk cache that is available to a single index scan.  This is
        factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher
        value makes it more likely index scans will be used, a lower
        value makes it more likely sequential scans will be used. When
        setting this parameter you should consider both
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s shared buffers and the
        portion of the kernel's disk cache that will be used for
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> data files.  Also, take into
        account the expected number of concurrent queries using different
        indexes, since they will have to share the available space.
        This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory
        allocated by PostgreSQL, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache;
        it is used only for estimation purposes.
        The value is measured in disk pages, which are

        The planner will rewrite explicit inner <literal>JOIN</>
        constructs into lists of <literal>FROM</> items whenever a
        list of no more than this many items in total would
        result. Prior to <productname>PostgreSQL</> 7.4, joins
        specified via the <literal>JOIN</literal> construct would
        never be reordered by the query planner. The query planner has
        subsequently been improved so that inner joins written in this
        form can be reordered; this configuration parameter controls
        the extent to which this reordering is performed.
        <note>
         <para>
          At present, the order of outer joins specified via the
          <literal>JOIN</> construct is never adjusted by the query
          planner; therefore, <varname>join_collapse_limit</> has no
          effect on this behavior. The planner may be improved to
          reorder some classes of outer joins in a future release of
          <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.

       <para>
        By default, this variable is set the same as
        <varname>from_collapse_limit</varname>, which is appropriate
        for most uses. Setting it to 1 prevents any reordering of
        inner <literal>JOIN</>s. Thus, the explicit join order
        specified in the query will be the actual order in which the
        relations are joined. The query planner does not always choose
        the optimal join order; advanced users may elect to
        temporarily set this variable to 1, and then specify the join
        order they desire explicitly. Another consequence of setting
        this variable to 1 is that the query planner will behave more
        like the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.3 query
        planner, which some users might find useful for backward
        compatibility reasons.
       </para>

       <para>
        Setting this variable to a value between 1 and
        <varname>from_collapse_limit</varname> might be useful to
        trade off planning time against the quality of the chosen plan
        (higher values produce better plans).

        However, truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened

         This is a <function>printf</>-style string that is output at the
         beginning of each log line. The default is an empty string.
         Each recognized escape is replaced as outlined 
         below - anything else that looks like an escape is ignored. Other
         characters are copied straight to the log line. Some escapes are
         only recognised by session processes, and do not apply to
         background processes such as the postmaster. <application>Syslog</>
         produces its own 
         time stamp and process ID information, so you probably do not want to
         use those escapes if you are using <application>syslog</>.
         This option can only be set at server start or in the
         <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> configuration file.

        This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait on a lock
        before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The
        check for deadlock is relatively slow, so the server doesn't run
        it every time it waits for a lock. We (optimistically?) assume
        that deadlocks are not common in production applications and
        just wait on the lock for a while before starting the check for a
        deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time
        wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of
        real deadlock errors. The default is 1000 (i.e., one second),
        which is probably about the smallest value you would want in
        practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it.
        Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time,
        so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before
        the waiter decides to check for deadlock.

        This controls the inheritance semantics, in particular whether
        subtables are included by various commands by default. They were
        not included in versions prior to 7.1. If you need the old
        behavior you can set this variable to off, but in the long run
        you are encouraged to change your applications to use the
        <literal>ONLY</literal> key word to exclude subtables. See

        When turned on, expressions of the form
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> (or <literal>NULL
        = <replaceable>expr</></literal>) are treated as
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> IS NULL</literal>, that is, they
        return true if <replaceable>expr</> evaluates to the null value,
        and false otherwise. The correct SQL-spec-compliant behavior of
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> is to always
        return null (unknown). Therefore this option defaults to off.
       </para>

       <para>
        However, filtered forms in <productname>Microsoft
        Access</productname> generate queries that appear to use
        <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> to test for
        null values, so if you use that interface to access the database you
        might want to turn this option on.  Since expressions of the
        form <literal><replaceable>expr</> = NULL</literal> always
        return the null value (using the correct interpretation) they are not
        very useful and do not appear often in normal applications, so
        this option does little harm in practice.  But new users are
        frequently confused about the semantics of expressions
        involving null values, so this option is not on by default.

        not other comparison operators or other expressions

        This variable specifies one or several class names to be used for

        variable is a variable not normally known
        to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> proper but used by some
        add-on module.  Such variables must have names consisting of a class
        name, a dot, and a variable name.  <varname>custom_variable_classes</>
        specifies all the class names in use in a particular installation.
        This option can only be set at server start or in the

    <para>
     The difficulty with setting custom variables in
     <filename>postgresql.conf</> is that the file must be read before add-on
     modules have been loaded, and so custom variables would ordinarily be
     rejected as unknown.  When <varname>custom_variable_classes</> is set,
     the server will accept definitions of arbitrary variables within each
     specified class.  These variables will be treated as placeholders and
     will have no function until the module that defines them is loaded. When a
     module for a specific class is loaded, it will add the proper variable
     definitions for its class name, convert any placeholder
     values according to those definitions, and issue warnings for any
     placeholders of its class that remain (which presumably would be
     misspelled configuration variables).

   A large <productname>PostgreSQL</> installation can quickly exhaust

   <para>
    Shared memory and semaphores are collectively referred to as
    <quote><systemitem class="osname">System V</>
    <acronym>IPC</></quote> (together with message queues, which are not
    relevant for <productname>PostgreSQL</>). Almost all modern
    operating systems provide these features, but not all of them have
    them turned on or sufficiently sized by default, especially systems
    with BSD heritage. (For the <systemitem class="osname">QNX</> and
    <systemitem class="osname">BeOS</> ports, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
    provides its own replacement implementation of these facilities.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The complete lack of these facilities is usually manifested by an
    <errorname>Illegal system call</> error upon server start. In
    that case there's nothing left to do but to reconfigure your
    kernel.  <productname>PostgreSQL</> won't work without them.
   </para>

   <para>
    When <productname>PostgreSQL</> exceeds one of the various hard
    <acronym>IPC</> limits, the server will refuse to start and
    should leave an instructive error message describing the problem
    encountered and what to do about it. (See also <xref
    linkend="postmaster-start-failures">.) The relevant kernel
    parameters are named consistently across different systems; <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters"> gives an overview. The methods to set
    them, however, vary. Suggestions for some platforms are given below.
    Be warned that it is often necessary to reboot your machine, and
    possibly even recompile the kernel, to change these settings.

   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>SHMMAX</primary></indexterm> The most important
    shared memory parameter is <varname>SHMMAX</>, the maximum size, in
    bytes, of a shared memory segment. If you get an error message from
    <function>shmget</> like <errorname>Invalid argument</>, it is
    likely that this limit has been exceeded. The size of the required
    shared memory segment varies both with the number of requested
    buffers (<option>-B</> option) and the number of allowed connections
    (<option>-N</> option), although the former is the most significant.
    (You can, as a temporary solution, lower these settings to eliminate
    the failure.) As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size as suggested in <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters">.  Any error message you might get will
    contain the size of the failed allocation request.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some systems also have a limit on the total amount of shared memory in
    the system (<varname>SHMALL</>).  Make sure this is large enough
    for <productname>PostgreSQL</> plus any other applications that
    are using shared memory segments.  (Caution: <varname>SHMALL</>
    is measured in pages rather than bytes on many systems.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<varname>SHMMIN</>), which should be at most
    approximately 256 kB for <productname>PostgreSQL</> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<varname>SHMMNI</>) or per-process (<varname>SHMSEG</>) are unlikely
    to cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<option>-N</> option), in sets of 16.  Each such set will also
    contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <quote>magic
    number</quote>, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <varname>SEMMNS</>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <varname>max_connections</> plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections (see the formula in <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters">).  The parameter <varname>SEMMNI</>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <literal>ceil(max_connections / 16)</>. Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <errorname>No space
    left on device</>, from the function <function>semget</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    In some cases it might also be necessary to increase
    <varname>SEMMAP</> to be at least on the order of
    <varname>SEMMNS</>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <varname>SEMMSL</> parameter, which determines how many
    semaphores can be in a set, must be at least 17 for
    <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Various other settings related to <quote>semaphore undo</>, such as
    <varname>SEMMNU</> and <varname>SEMUME</>, are not of concern
    for <productname>PostgreSQL</>.

        <para>
         By default, only 4 MB of shared memory is supported. Keep in
         mind that shared memory is not pageable; it is locked in RAM.
         To increase the amount of shared memory supported by your
         system, add something like the following to your kernel configuration
         file:
<programlisting>
options "SHMALL=8192"
options "SHMMAX=\(SHMALL*PAGE_SIZE\)"
</programlisting>
         <varname>SHMALL</> is measured in 4KB pages, so a value of
         1024 represents 4 MB of shared memory. Therefore the above increases
         the maximum shared memory area to 32 MB.
         For those running 4.3 or later, you will probably also need to increase
         <varname>KERNEL_VIRTUAL_MB</> above the default <literal>248</>.
         Once all changes have been made, recompile the kernel, and reboot.

       <para>
        For those running 4.0 and earlier releases, use <command>bpatch</>

<screen>
$ <userinput>bpatch -r sysptsize</>
<computeroutput>0x9 = 9</>
</screen>
        Next, add <varname>SYSPTSIZE</> as a hard-coded value in the
        kernel configuration file. Increase the value you found using
        <command>bpatch</>. Add 1 for every additional 4 MB of
        shared memory you desire.

   <title>Resource Limits</title>

   <para>
    Unix-like operating systems enforce various kinds of resource limits
    that might interfere with the operation of your
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server. Of particular
    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a <quote>hard</quote> and a
    <quote>soft</quote> limit. The soft limit is what actually counts
    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <function>setrlimit</function> is responsible for setting these
    parameters. The shell's built-in command <command>ulimit</command>
    (Bourne shells) or <command>limit</command> (<application>csh</>) is
    used to control the resource limits from the command line. On
    BSD-derived systems the file <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>
    controls the various resource limits set during login. See the
    operating system documentation for details. The relevant
    parameters are <varname>maxproc</varname>,
    <varname>openfiles</varname>, and <varname>datasize</varname>. For
    example:
<programlisting>
default:\
...
        :datasize-cur=256M:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :openfiles-cur=256:\
...
</programlisting>
    (<literal>-cur</literal> is the soft limit.  Append
    <literal>-max</literal> to set the hard limit.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Kernels can also have system-wide limits on some resources.
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      On <productname>Linux</productname>
      <filename>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</filename> determines the
      maximum number of open files that the kernel will support.  It can
      be changed by writing a different number into the file or by
      adding an assignment in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.
      The maximum limit of files per process is fixed at the time the
      kernel is compiled; see
      <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt</filename> for
      more information.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server uses one process
    per connection so you should provide for at least as many processes
    as allowed connections, in addition to what you need for the rest
    of your system.  This is usually not a problem but if you run
    several servers on one machine things might get tight.
   </para>

   <para>
    The factory default limit on open files is often set to
    <quote>socially friendly</quote> values that allow many users to
    coexist on a machine without using an inappropriate fraction of
    the system resources.  If you run many servers on a machine this
    is perhaps what you want, but on dedicated servers you may want to
    raise this limit.
   </para>

   <para>
    On the other side of the coin, some systems allow individual
    processes to open large numbers of files; if more than a few
    processes do so then the system-wide limit can easily be exceeded.
    If you find this happening, and you do not want to alter the
    system-wide limit, you can set <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s <xref
    linkend="guc-max-files-per-process"> configuration parameter to
    limit the consumption of open files.

  <sect2>
   <title>Linux Memory Overcommit</title>

   <para>
    In Linux 2.4 and later, the default virtual memory behavior is not
    optimal for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. Because of the
    way that the kernel implements memory overcommit, the kernel may
    terminate the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server (the
    <filename>postmaster</filename> process) if the memory demands of
    another process cause the system to run out of virtual memory.
   </para>

   <para>
    If this happens, you will see a kernel message that looks like
    this (consult your system documentation and configuration on where
    to look for such a message):
<programlisting>
Out of Memory: Killed process 12345 (postmaster). 
</programlisting>
    This indicates that the <filename>postmaster</filename> process
    has been terminated due to memory pressure.
    Although existing database connections will continue to function
    normally, no new connections will be accepted.  To recover,
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will need to be restarted.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to avoid this problem is to run
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    on a machine where you can be sure that other processes will not
    run the machine out of memory.
   </para>

   <para>
    On Linux 2.6 and later, a better solution is to modify the kernel's
    behavior so that it will not <quote>overcommit</> memory.  This is
    done by selecting strict overcommit mode via <command>sysctl</command>:
<programlisting>
sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2
</programlisting>
    or placing an equivalent entry in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</>.
    You may also wish to modify the related setting 
    <literal>vm.overcommit_ratio</>.  For details see the kernel documentation
    file <filename>Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some vendors' Linux 2.4 kernels are reported to have early versions
    of the 2.6 overcommit <command>sysctl</command> parameter.  However, setting
    <literal>vm.overcommit_memory</> to 2
    on a kernel that does not have the relevant code will make
    things worse not better.  It is recommended that you inspect
    the actual kernel source code (see the function
    <function>vm_enough_memory</> in the file <filename>mm/mmap.c</>)
    to verify what is supported in your copy before you try this in a 2.4
    installation.  The presence of the <filename>overcommit-accounting</>
    documentation file should <emphasis>not</> be taken as evidence that the
    feature is there.  If in any doubt, consult a kernel expert or your
    kernel vendor.

   There are several ways to shut down the database server. You control

      <para>
       After receiving <systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem>, the server
       disallows new connections, but lets existing sessions end their

     <term><systemitem>SIGINT</systemitem><indexterm><primary>SIGINT</></></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The server disallows new connections and sends all existing
       server processes <systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem>, which will cause them
       to abort their current transactions and exit promptly. It then
       waits for the server processes to exit and finally shuts down. This is the
       <firstterm>Fast Shutdown</firstterm>.
      </para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
      This is the <firstterm>Immediate Shutdown</firstterm>, which
      will cause the <command>postmaster</command> process to send a
      <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem> to all child processes and exit
      immediately, without properly shutting itself down. The child processes
      likewise exit immediately upon receiving
      <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem>. This will lead to recovery (by
      replaying the WAL log) upon next start-up. This is recommended
      only in emergencies.

     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
  </para>

  <para>
   The <xref linkend="app-pg-ctl"> program provides a convenient
   interface for sending these signals to shut down the server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Alternatively, you can send the signal directly using <command>kill</>.
   The <acronym>PID</> of the <command>postmaster</command> process can be
   found using the <command>ps</command> program, or from the file
   <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. For
   example, to do a fast shutdown:
<screen>
$ <userinput>kill -INT `head -1 /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

   <important>
    <para>
     It is best not to use <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> to shut down
     the server.  Doing so will prevent the server from releasing
     shared memory and semaphores, which may then have to be done
     manually before a new server can be started.  Furthermore,
     <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> kills the <command>postmaster</command>
     process without letting it relay the signal to its subprocesses,
     so it will be necessary to kill the individual subprocesses by hand as
     well.

 <sect1 id="ssl-tcp">
  <title>Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSL</title>

  <indexterm zone="ssl-tcp">
   <primary>SSL</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> has native support for using
   <acronym>SSL</> connections to encrypt client/server communications
   for increased security. This requires that
   <productname>OpenSSL</productname> is installed on both client and
   server systems and that support in <productname>PostgreSQL</> is
   enabled at build time (see <xref linkend="installation">).
  </para>

  <para>
   With <acronym>SSL</> support compiled in, the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> server can be started with
   <acronym>SSL</> enabled by setting the parameter
   <xref linkend="guc-ssl"> to <literal>on</> in
   <filename>postgresql.conf</>. When
   starting in <acronym>SSL</> mode, the server will look for the
   files <filename>server.key</> and <filename>server.crt</> in the
   data directory, which must contain the server private key
   and certificate, respectively. These files must be set up correctly
   before an <acronym>SSL</>-enabled server can start. If the private key is
   protected with a passphrase, the server will prompt for the
   passphrase and will not start until it has been entered.
  </para>

  <para>
   The server will listen for both standard and <acronym>SSL</>
   connections on the same TCP port, and will negotiate with any
   connecting client on whether to use <acronym>SSL</>.  By default,
   this is at the client's option; see <xref
   linkend="auth-pg-hba-conf"> about how to set up the server to
   require use of <acronym>SSL</> for some or all connections.
  </para>

  <para>
   For details on how to create your server private key and certificate,
   refer to the <productname>OpenSSL</> documentation. A
   self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a
   certificate signed by a certificate authority (<acronym>CA</>)
   (either one of the global
   <acronym>CAs</> or a local one) should be used in production so the
   client can verify the server's identity. To create a quick
   self-signed certificate, use the following
   <productname>OpenSSL</productname> command:
<programlisting>
openssl req -new -text -out server.req
</programlisting>
   Fill out the information that <command>openssl</> asks for. Make sure
   that you enter the local host name as <quote>Common Name</>; the challenge
   password can be left blank. The program will generate a key that is
   passphrase protected; it will not accept a passphrase that is less
   than four characters long. To remove the passphrase (as you must if
   you want automatic start-up of the server), run the commands
<programlisting>
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
rm privkey.pem
</programlisting>
   Enter the old passphrase to unlock the existing key. Now do
<programlisting>
openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt
chmod og-rwx server.key
</programlisting>
   to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate and to copy the
   key and certificate to where the server will look for them.
  </para>

  <para>
   If verification of client certificates is required, place the
   certificates of the <acronym>CA</acronym>(s) you wish to check for in
   the file <filename>root.crt</filename> in the data directory.  When
   present, a client certificate will be requested from the client
   during SSL connection startup, and it must have been signed by one of the
   certificates present in <filename>root.crt</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When the <filename>root.crt</filename> file is not present, client
   certificates will not be requested or checked.  In this mode, SSL
   provides communication security but not authentication.
  </para>

  <para>
   The files <filename>server.key</>, <filename>server.crt</>,
   and <filename>root.crt</filename> are only examined during server
   start; so you must restart the server to make changes in them take
   effect.

 <sect1 id="ssh-tunnels">
  <title>Secure TCP/IP Connections with <application>SSH</application> Tunnels</title>

  <indexterm zone="ssh-tunnels">
   <primary>ssh</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   One can use <application>SSH</application> to encrypt the network
   connection between clients and a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server. Done properly, this
   provides an adequately secure network connection, even for non-SSL-capable
   clients.
  </para>

  <para>
   First make sure that an <application>SSH</application> server is
   running properly on the same machine as the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server and that you can log in using
   <command>ssh</command> as some user. Then you can establish a secure
   tunnel with a command like this from the client machine:
<programlisting>
ssh -L 3333:foo.com:5432 joe@foo.com
</programlisting>
   The first number in the <option>-L</option> argument, 3333, is the
   port number of your end of the tunnel; it can be chosen freely. The
   second number, 5432, is the remote end of the tunnel: the port
   number your server is using. The name or IP address between
   the port numbers is the host with the database server you are going
   to connect to. In order to connect to the database server using
   this tunnel, you connect to port 3333 on the local machine:
<programlisting>
psql -h localhost -p 3333 template1
</programlisting>
   To the database server it will then look as though you are really
   user <literal>joe@foo.com</literal> and it will use whatever
   authentication procedure was configured for connections from this
   user and host.  Note that the server will not think the connection is
   SSL-encrypted, since in fact it is not encrypted between the
   <application>SSH</application> server and the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server.  This should not pose any
   extra security risk as long as they are on the same machine.
  </para>
  <para>
   In order for the
   tunnel setup to succeed you must be allowed to connect via
   <command>ssh</command> as <literal>joe@foo.com</literal>, just
   as if you had attempted to use <command>ssh</command> to set up a
   terminal session.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    Several other applications exist that can provide secure tunnels using
    a procedure similar in concept to the one just described.
   </para>
