    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>
     <application>psql</application> is a terminal-based front-end to 
     <productname>Postgres</productname>. It enables you to type in queries
     interactively, issue them to <productname>Postgres</productname>, and see
     the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file.
     In addition, it provides a number of meta-commands and
     various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide
     variety of tasks.

    <title>Connecting To A Database</title>

    <para>
    <application>psql</application> is a regular <productname>Postgres</productname>
    client application. In order to connect to a database you need to know the
    name of your target database, the hostname and port number of the server
    and what user name you want to connect as. <application>psql</application> can be
    told about those parameters via command line options, namely <option>-d</option>,
    <option>-h</option>, <option>-p</option>, and <option>-U</option> respectively.
    If an argument is found that does not belong to any option it will be interpreted
    as the database name (or the user name, if the database name is also
	 given). Not all these options are required, defaults do apply.
    If you omit the host name psql will connect via a UNIX domain socket
    to a server on the
    local host. The default port number is compile-time determined. Since the database
    server uses the same default, you will not have to specify the port in most
    cases. The default user name is your Unix username, as is the default
    database name.
    Note that you can't just connect to any database under any username. Your database
    administrator should have informed you about your access rights. To save you some typing
    you can also set the environment variables <envar>PGDATABASE</envar>,
    <envar>PGHOST</envar>, <envar>PGPORT</envar> and <envar>PGUSER</envar>
    to appropriate values.
    </para>

    <para>
    If the connection could not be made for any reason (e.g., insufficient
    privileges, postmaster is not running on the server, etc.),
    <application>psql</application> will return an error and terminate.

    <title>Entering Queries</title>

    <para>
    In normal operation, <application>psql</application> provides a prompt with
    the name of the database to which <application>psql</application> is currently
    connected, followed by the string "=>". For example,
<programlisting>
$ <userinput>psql testdb</userinput>
Welcome to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

testdb=>
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
    At the prompt, the user may type in <acronym>SQL</acronym> queries.  
    Ordinarily, input lines are sent to the backend when a query-terminating
    semicolon is reached. An end of line does not terminate a query! Thus queries
    can be spread over several lines for clarity. If the query was sent and without
    error, the query results are displayed on the screen.
    </para>

    <para>
    Whenever a query is executed, <application>psql</application> also polls
    for asynchronous notification events generated by
    <xref linkend="SQL-LISTEN" endterm="SQL-LISTEN-title"> and
    <xref linkend="SQL-NOTIFY" endterm="SQL-NOTIFY-title">.

    <title><application>psql</application> Meta-Commands</title>

    <para>
    Anything you enter in <application>psql</application> that begins with an
    unquoted backslash is a <application>psql</application> meta-command that is
    processed by <application>psql</application> itself.
    These commands are what makes
    <application>psql</application> interesting for administration or scripting.
    Meta-commands are more commonly called slash or backslash commands.
    </para>

    <para>
    The format of a <application>psql</application> command is the backslash, 
    followed immediately by a command verb, then any arguments. The arguments
    are separated from the command verb and each other by any number of white
    space characters.
    </para>

    <para>
    To include whitespace into an argument you must quote it with a single
    quote. To include a single quote into such an argument, precede it by
    a backslash. Anything contained in single quotes is furthermore subject to
    C-like substitutions for <literal>\n</literal> (new line), <literal>\t</literal>
     (tab), <literal>\</literal><replaceable>digits</replaceable>,
    <literal>\0</literal><replaceable>digits</replaceable>, and
    <literal>\0x</literal><replaceable>digits</replaceable>
    (the character with the given decimal, octal, or hexadecimal code).
    </para>

    <para>
    If an unquoted argument begins with a colon (<literal>:</literal>),
    it is taken as a variable and the value of the variable is taken as the
    argument instead.
    </para>

    <para>
    Arguments that are quoted in <quote>backticks</quote> (<literal>`</literal>)
    are taken as a command line that is passed to the shell. The output of the
    command (with a trailing newline removed) is taken as the argument value.
    The above escape sequences also apply in backticks.
    </para>

    <para>
    Some commands take the name of an <acronym>SQL</acronym> identifier (such as
    a table name) as argument. These arguments follow the syntax rules of
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> regarding double quotes: an identifier without
    double quotes is coerced to lower-case. For all other commands
    double quotes are not special and will become part of the argument.
    </para>

    <para>
    Parsing for arguments stops when another unquoted backslash occurs. This
    is taken as the beginning of a new meta-command. The special sequence
    <literal>\\</literal>
    (two backslashes) marks the end of arguments and continues parsing
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> queries, if any. That way <acronym>SQL</acronym> and
    <application>psql</application> commands can be freely mixed on a line.
    But in any case, the arguments of a meta-command cannot continue beyond the end
    of the line. 
    </para>

    <para>
    The following meta-commands are defined:

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>\a</literal></term>
        <listitem>
        <para>
	If the current table output format is unaligned, switch to aligned.
	If it is not unaligned, set it to unaligned. This command is
	kept for backwards compatibility. See <command>\pset</command> for a
	general solution.
        </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>\C</literal> [ <replaceable class="parameter">title</replaceable> ]</term>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        Set the title of any tables being printed as the result of a query or
        unset any such title. This command is equivalent to
        <literal>\pset title <replaceable class="parameter">title</replaceable></literal>.
        (The name of this
        command derives from <quote>caption</quote>, as it was previously only
	used to set the caption in an <acronym>HTML</acronym> table.)
        </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>\connect</literal> (or <literal>\c</literal>) [ <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> [ <replaceable class="parameter">username</replaceable> ] ]</term>
        <listitem>
        <para>
	Establishes a connection to a new database and/or under a user name. The
	previous connection is closed.
	If <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> is <literal>-</literal>
	the current database name is assumed.
	</para>

	<para>
	If <replaceable class="parameter">username</replaceable> is omitted
        the current user name is assumed.
	</para>

	<para>
	As a special rule, <command>\connect</command> without any arguments will connect
	to the default database as the default user (as you would have gotten
	by starting <application>psql</application> without any arguments).
	</para>

	<para>
	If the connection attempt failed (wrong username, access denied, etc.) the
	previous connection will be kept if and only if <application>psql</application> is
	in interactive mode. When executing a non-interactive script, processing
	will immediately stop with an error. This distinction was chosen as a user
	convenience against typos on the one hand, and a safety mechanism that
	scripts are not accidentally acting on the wrong database on the other hand.

        Performs a frontend (client) copy. This is an operation that runs an
	<acronym>SQL</acronym> <xref linkend="SQL-COPY" endterm="SQL-COPY-title"> command,
        but instead of the backend's reading or writing the specified file, and 
        consequently requiring backend access and special user privilege, 
	as well as being bound to the file system accessible by the backend,
        <application>psql</application> reads or writes the 
        file and routes the data between the backend and the local file system.
	</para>

	<para>
	The syntax of the command is similar to that of the <acronym>SQL</acronym>
	<command>COPY</command> command (see its description for the details).
	Note that, because of this, special parsing rules apply to the
	<command>\copy</command> command. In particular, the variable
	substitution rules and backslash escapes do not apply.
	</para>

        <tip>
        <para>
	This operation is not as efficient as the <acronym>SQL</acronym> 
	<command>COPY</command> command because all data must pass through the
	client/server IP or socket connection. For large amounts of data the other
	technique may be preferable.
        </para>

        <note>
        <para>
        Note the difference in interpretation of <literal>stdin</literal> and <literal>stdout</literal>
        between frontend and backend copies: in a frontend copy these always refer
        to <application>psql</application>'s input and output stream. On a backend
        copy <literal>stdin</literal> comes from wherever the <command>COPY</command>
        itself came from (for example, a script run with the <option>-f</option> option),
        and <literal>stdout</literal> refers to the query output stream (see

        Use <command>\i</command> for that.) This means also that

lo_import 152801

	The response indicates that the large object received object id 152801

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>format</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	  <para>
	  Sets the output format to one of <literal>unaligned</literal>,
	  <literal>aligned</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, or <literal>latex</literal>.
	  Unique abbreviations are allowed. (That would mean one letter is enough.)
	  </para>

	  <para>
	  <quote>Unaligned</quote> writes all fields of a tuple on a line, separated
	  by the currently active field separator. This is intended to create output
	  that might be intended to be read in by other programs (tab-separated,
	  comma-separated).
	  <quote>Aligned</quote> mode is the
	  standard, human-readable, nicely formatted text output that is default.
	  The <quote><acronym>HTML</acronym></quote> and <quote>LaTeX</quote> modes
	  put out tables that are intended to be included in documents using the
	  respective mark-up language. They are not complete documents! (This might

	  <varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>border</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	  <para>
	  The second argument must be a number. In general, the higher the number
	  the more borders and lines the tables will have, but this depends on
	  the particular format. In <acronym>HTML</acronym> mode, this will
	  translate directly into the <literal>border=...</literal> attribute, in

	  <varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>expanded</literal> (or <literal>x</literal>)</term>

	  <para>
	  Toggles between regular and expanded format. When expanded format is

	  fit on the screen in the normal <quote>horizontal</quote> mode.

	  The second argument is a string that should be printed whenever a field
	  is null. The default is not to print anything, which can easily be mistaken
	  for, say, an empty string. Thus, one might choose to write
	  <literal>\pset null '(null)'</literal>.

	  one can create, for example, tab- or comma-separated output, which other
	  programs might prefer. To set a tab as field separator, type
	  <literal>\pset fieldsep '\t'</literal>. The default field separator is
	  <literal>'|'</literal> (a <quote>pipe</quote> symbol).

	  Sets the table title for any subsequently printed tables. This can be
	  used to give your output descriptive tags. If no argument is given,
	  the title is unset.
	  </para>

	  <note>

	  <listitem>
	  <para>
	  Allows you to specify any attributes to be placed inside the <acronym>HTML</acronym>
	  <sgmltag>table</sgmltag> tag. This could for example be
	  <literal>cellpadding</literal> or <literal>bgcolor</literal>. Note that you

	  <varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>pager</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	  <para>
	  Toggles the list of a pager to do table output. If the environment variable
	  <envar>PAGER</envar> is set, the output is piped to the specified program.
	  Otherwise <filename>more</filename> is used.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	  In any case, <application>psql</application> only uses the pager if it
	  seems appropriate. That means among other things that the output is to
	  a terminal and that the table would normally not fit on the screen.
	  Because of the modular nature of the printing routines it is not always
	  possible to predict the number of lines that will actually be printed.
	  For that reason <application>psql</application> might not appear very
	  discriminating about when to use the pager and when not to.

      <term>-e, --echo-queries</term>
      <listitem>
      <para>
      Show all queries that are sent to the backend.

      <para>
      Echoes the actual queries generated by \d and other backslash commands.
      You can use this if you wish to include similar functionality into
      your own programs. This is equivalent to setting the variable
      <envar>ECHO_HIDDEN</envar> from within <application>psql</application>.

      <para>
      Use the file <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>
      as the source of queries instead of reading queries interactively.
      After the file is processed, <application>psql</application> terminates.
      This in many ways equivalent to the internal command <command>\i</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
      Using this option is subtly different from writing
      <literal>psql &lt; <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable></literal>.
      In general, both will do what you expect, but using <literal>-f</literal>
      enables some nice features such as error messages with line numbers.
      There is also a slight chance that using this option will reduce
      the start-up overhead. On the other hand, the variant using the shell's
      input redirection is (in theory) guaranteed to yield exactly the same
      output that you would have gotten had you entered everything by hand.

      <para>
      This option is deprecated, as it is conceptually flawed. (Prompting for
      a non-default user name and prompting for a password because the

      <para>
      As of version 7.0, <application>psql</application> automatically issues a

      the connection attempt will fail.

    <title id="APP-PSQL-variables-title">Variables</title>

    <para>
    <application>psql</application> provides variable substitution features
    similar to common Unix command shells. This feature is new and not very
    sophisticated, yet, but there are plans to expand it in the future.
    Variables are simply name/value
    pairs, where the value can be any string of any length. To set variables,
    use the <application>psql</application> meta-command <command>\set</command>:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\set foo bar</userinput>
</programlisting>
    sets the variable <quote>foo</quote> to the value <quote>bar</quote>. To retrieve
    the content of the variable, precede the name with a colon and use it
    as the argument of any slash command:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\echo :foo</userinput>
bar
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <note>
    <para>
    The arguments of <command>\set</command> are subject to the same substitution
    rules as with other commands. Thus you can construct interesting references
    such as <literal>\set :foo 'something'</literal> and get <quote>soft
    links</quote> or <quote>variable variables</quote> of <productname>Perl</productname>
    or <productname><acronym>PHP</acronym></productname> fame, respectively.
    Unfortunately (or fortunately?), there is no way to do anything useful
    with these constructs. On the
    other hand, <literal>\set bar :foo</literal> is a perfectly valid way to copy
    a variable.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>
    If you call <command>\set</command> without a second argument, the variable is simply
    set, but has no value. To unset (or delete) a variable, use the command
    <command>\unset</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
    <application>psql</application>'s internal variable names can consist of
    letters, numbers, and underscores in any order and any number of them.
    A number of regular variables are treated specially by <application>psql</application>.
    They indicate certain option settings that can be changed at runtime
    by altering the value of the variable or represent some state of the application.
    Although you can use these
    variables for any other purpose, this is not recommended, as the
    program behavior might grow really strange really quickly.
    By convention, all specially treated variables consist of all upper-case letters
    (and possibly numbers and underscores). To ensure maximum compatibility in the
    future, avoid such variables. 
    A list of all specially treated variables follows.
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><envar>DBNAME</envar></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
        The name of the database you are currently connected to. This is set every time
        you connect to a database (including program start-up), but can be unset.

	<listitem>
	<para>
	If set to <quote><literal>all</literal></quote>, all lines entered or from a script
        are written to the standard output before they
	are parsed or executed. To specify this on program start-up, use the switch
        <option>-a</option>. If set to <quote><literal>queries</literal></quote>,
        <application>psql</application> merely prints all queries as they are sent to the
        backend. The option for this is <option>-e</option>.

      <varlistentry>
        <term><envar>ECHO_HIDDEN</envar></term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	When this variable is set and a backslash command queries the database, the query
	is first shown. This way you can study the <productname>Postgres</productname>
	internals and provide similar functionality in your own programs. If you set the
	variable to the value <quote>noexec</quote>, the queries are just shown but are
	not actually sent to the backend and executed.

	<para>
         If  this variable is set  to  <literal>ignorespace</literal>, lines which begin with a
         space are not entered into the history list. If set to a value of
         <literal>ignoredups</literal>, lines matching the previous history line are not
         entered. A value of <literal>ignoreboth</literal> combines the two
         options.  If unset, or if set to any other value than those above, all lines read
         in interactive mode are saved on the history list.

	<listitem>
	<para>
	If you use the <productname>Postgres</productname> large object
        interface to specially store data that does not fit into one tuple,
        all the operations must be contained in a transaction block. (See the
        documentation of the large object interface for more information.) Since
        <application>psql</application> has no way to tell if you already
        have a transaction in progress when you call one of its internal
        commands <command>\lo_export</command>, <command>\lo_import</command>,
        <command>\lo_unlink</command> it must take some arbitrary action. This
        action could either be to roll back any transaction that might already
        be in progress, or to commit any such transaction, or to do nothing at
        all. In the last case you must provide your own
        <command>BEGIN TRANSACTION</command>/<command>COMMIT</command> block or
        the results will be unpredictable (usually resulting in the desired
        action's not being performed in any case).
	</para>

	<para>
	To choose what you want to do you set this variable to one of
	<quote>rollback</quote>, <quote>commit</quote>, or <quote>nothing</quote>.
        The default is to roll back the transaction. If you just want to load one
        or a few objects this is fine. However, if you intend to transfer many
        large objects, it might be advisable to provide one explicit transaction
        block around all commands.

	<listitem>
	<para>
	By default, if non-interactive scripts encounter an error, such as a
	malformed <acronym>SQL</acronym> query or internal meta-command,
	processing continues. This has been the traditional behavior of
        <application>psql</application> but it is sometimes not desirable. If this variable
	is set, script processing will immediately terminate. If the script was
	called from another script it will terminate in the same fashion.
	If the outermost script was not called from an interactive <application>psql</application>
	session but rather using the <option>-f</option> option, <application>psql</application>
	will return error code 3, to distinguish this case from fatal

    <title id="APP-PSQL-sql-interpol-title"><acronym>SQL</acronym> Interpolation</title>

    <para>
    An additional useful feature of <application>psql</application> variables
    is that you can substitute (<quote>interpolate</quote>) them into
    regular <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements. The syntax for this is again to prepend
    the variable name with a colon (<literal>:</literal>).
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\set foo 'my_table'</userinput>
testdb=> <userinput>SELECT * FROM :foo;</userinput>
</programlisting>
    would then query the table <literal>my_table</literal>. The value of the
    variable is copied literally, so it can even contain unbalanced quotes or
    backslash commands. You must make sure that it makes sense where you put it.
    Variable interpolation will not be performed into quoted <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    entities.
    </para>

    <para>
    A popular application of this facility is to refer to the last inserted
    <acronym>OID</acronym> in subsequent statement to build a foreign key
    scenario.
    Another possible use of this mechanism is to copy the contents of a file
    into a field. First load the file into a variable and then proceed as above.
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\set content '\'' `cat my_file.txt` '\''</userinput>
testdb=> <userinput>INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (:content);</userinput>
</programlisting>
    One possible problem with this approach is that <filename>my_file.txt</filename>
    might contain single quotes. These need to be escaped so that
    they don't cause a syntax error when the third line is processed. This
    could be done with the program <application>sed</application>:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\set content `sed -e "s/'/\\\\\\'/g" < my_file.txt`</userinput>
</programlisting>
    Observe the correct number of backslashes (6)! You can resolve it this way: After
    <application>psql</application> has parsed this line, it passes
    <literal>sed -e "s/'/\\\'/g" < my_file.txt</literal> to the shell. The shell
    will do it's own thing inside the double quotes and execute <filename>sed</filename>
    with the arguments <literal>-e</literal> and <literal>s/'/\\'/g</literal>.
    When <application>sed</application> parses this it will replace the two
    backslashes with a single one and then do the substitution. Perhaps at
    one point you thought it was great that all Unix commands use the same
    escape character. And this is ignoring the fact that you might have to
    escape all backslashes as well because <acronym>SQL</acronym> text constants
    are also subject to certain interpretations. In that case you might
    be better off preparing the file externally.
    </para>

    <para>
    Since colons may legally appear in queries, the following rule applies: If the variable
    is not set, the character sequence <quote>colon+name</quote> is not changed. In any
    case you can escape a colon with a backslash to protect it from interpretation.
    (The colon syntax for variables is standard <acronym>SQL</acronym> for embedded
    query languages, such as <application>ecpg</application>. The colon syntax for
    array slices and type casts are <productname>Postgres</productname> extensions,
    hence the conflict.)

    <para>
    The prompts <application>psql</application> issues can be customized to
    your preference. The three variables <envar>PROMPT1</envar>, <envar>PROMPT2</envar>,
    and <envar>PROMPT3</envar> contain strings and special escape sequences
    that describe the appearance of the prompt. Prompt 1 is the normal prompt
    that is issued when <application>psql</application> requests a new query.
    Prompt 2 is issued when more input is expected during query input because
    the query was not terminated with a semicolon or a quote was not closed.
    Prompt 3 is issued when you run an <acronym>SQL</acronym> <command>COPY</command>
    command and you are expected to type in the tuples on the terminal.

    <para>
    The value of the respective prompt variable is printed literally, except where

    <title><acronym>GNU</acronym> readline</title>

    <para>
    <application>psql</application> supports the readline and history libraries for
    convenient line editing and retrieval. The command history is stored in a file
    named <filename>.psql_history</filename> in your home directory and is reloaded when
    <application>psql</application> starts up.
    Tab-completion is also supported, although
    the completion logic makes no claim to be an <acronym>SQL</acronym> parser.
    When available, <application>psql</application> is automatically built to use these
    features. If for some reason you do not like the tab completion, you can turn if off
    by putting this in a file named <filename>.inputrc</filename> in your
    home directory:
<programlisting>
$if psql
set disable-completion on
$endif
</programlisting>
    (This is not a <application>psql</application> but a <application>readline</application>
    feature. Read its documentation for further details.)
    </para>

    <para>
    If you have the readline library installed but <application>psql</application>
    does not seem to use it, you must make sure that <productname>Postgres</productname>'s
    top-level <filename>configure</filename> script finds it. <filename>configure</filename>
    needs to find both the library <filename>libreadline.a</filename>
    (or a shared library equivalent)
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> the header files <filename>readline.h</filename> and
    <filename>history.h</filename> (or <filename>readline/readline.h</filename> and
    <filename>readline/history.h</filename>) in appropriate directories. If
    you have the library and header files installed in an obscure place you
    must tell <filename>configure</filename> about them, for example:
<programlisting>
$ ./configure --with-includes=/opt/gnu/include --with-libs=/opt/gnu/lib  ...
</programlisting>
    Then you have to recompile <application>psql</application> (not necessarily
    the entire code tree).

  <para>
  The first example shows how to spread a query over several lines of input.
  Notice the changing prompt:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>CREATE TABLE my_table (</userinput>
testdb(> <userinput> first integer not null default 0,</userinput>
testdb(> <userinput> second text</userinput>
testdb-> <userinput>);</userinput>
CREATE
</programlisting>
  Now look at the table definition again:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\d my_table</userinput>
             Table "my_table"
 Attribute |  Type   |      Modifier
-----------+---------+--------------------
 first     | integer | not null default 0
 second    | text    |

</programlisting>
  At this point you decide to change the prompt to something more
  interesting:
<programlisting>
testdb=> <userinput>\set PROMPT1 '%n@%m %~%R%# '</userinput>
peter@localhost testdb=>
</programlisting>
  Let's assume you have filled the table with data and want to take a look at it:
<programlisting>
peter@localhost testdb=> SELECT * FROM my_table;
 first | second
-------+--------
     1 | one
     2 | two
     3 | three
     4 | four
(4 rows)

</programlisting>
  Notice how the int4 columns in right aligned while the text column in left aligned.
  You can make this table look differently by using the <command>\pset</command>
  command:
<programlisting>
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset border 2</userinput>
Border style is 2.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>SELECT * FROM my_table;</userinput>
+-------+--------+
| first | second |
+-------+--------+
|     1 | one    |
|     2 | two    |
|     3 | three  |
|     4 | four   |
+-------+--------+
(4 rows)

peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset border 0</userinput>
Border style is 0.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>SELECT * FROM my_table;</userinput>
first second
----- ------
    1 one
    2 two
    3 three
    4 four
(4 rows)

peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset border 1</userinput>
Border style is 1.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset format unaligned</userinput>
Output format is unaligned.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset fieldsep ","</userinput>
Field separator is ",".
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\pset tuples_only</userinput>
Showing only tuples.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>SELECT second, first FROM my_table;</userinput>
one,1
two,2
three,3
four,4
</programlisting>
  Alternatively, use the short commands:
<programlisting>
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>\a \t \x</userinput>
Output format is aligned.
Tuples only is off.
Expanded display is on.
peter@localhost testdb=> <userinput>SELECT * FROM my_table;</userinput>
-[ RECORD 1 ]-
first  | 1
second | one
-[ RECORD 2 ]-
first  | 2
second | two
-[ RECORD 3 ]-
first  | 3
second | three
-[ RECORD 4 ]-
first  | 4
second | four

      if you get strange messages, keep this in mind. For example
<programlisting>
