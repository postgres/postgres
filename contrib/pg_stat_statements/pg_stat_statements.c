 *
 * pg_stat_statements.c
 *		Track statement execution times across a whole database cluster.
 *
 * Execution costs are totalled for each distinct source query, and kept in
 * a shared hashtable.  (We track only as many distinct queries as will fit
 * in the designated amount of shared memory.)
 *
 * As of Postgres 9.2, this module normalizes query entries.  Normalization
 * is a process whereby similar queries, typically differing only in their
 * constants (though the exact rules are somewhat more subtle than that) are
 * recognized as equivalent, and are tracked as a single entry.  This is
 * particularly useful for non-prepared queries.
 *
 * Normalization is implemented by fingerprinting queries, selectively
 * serializing those fields of each query tree's nodes that are judged to be
 * essential to the query.  This is referred to as a query jumble.  This is
 * distinct from a regular serialization in that various extraneous
 * information is ignored as irrelevant or not essential to the query, such
 * as the collations of Vars and, most notably, the values of constants.
 *
 * This jumble is acquired at the end of parse analysis of each query, and
 * a 32-bit hash of it is stored into the query's Query.queryId field.
 * The server then copies this value around, making it available in plan
 * tree(s) generated from the query.  The executor can then use this value
 * to blame query costs on the proper queryId.
 *
 * To facilitate presenting entries to users, we create "representative" query
 * strings in which constants are replaced with '?' characters, to make it
 * clearer what a normalized entry can represent.  To save on shared memory,
 * and to avoid having to truncate oversized query strings, we store these
 * strings in a temporary external query-texts file.  Offsets into this
 * file are kept in shared memory.
 *
 * Note about locking issues: to create or delete an entry in the shared
 * hashtable, one must hold pgss->lock exclusively.  Modifying any field
 * in an entry except the counters requires the same.  To look up an entry,
 * one must hold the lock shared.  To read or update the counters within
 * an entry, one must hold the lock shared or exclusive (so the entry doesn't
 * disappear!) and also take the entry's mutex spinlock.
 * The shared state variable pgss->extent (the next free spot in the external
 * query-text file) should be accessed only while holding either the
 * pgss->mutex spinlock, or exclusive lock on pgss->lock.  We use the mutex to
 * allow reserving file space while holding only shared lock on pgss->lock.
 * Rewriting the entire external query-text file, eg for garbage collection,
 * requires holding pgss->lock exclusively; this allows individual entries
 * in the file to be read or written while holding only shared lock.
