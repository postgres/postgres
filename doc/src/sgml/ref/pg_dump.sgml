  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</application> is a utility for exporting a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database. It makes consistent
   exports even if the database is being used concurrently.
   <application>pg_dump</application> does not block other users
   accessing the database (readers or writers).
   Note, however, that except in simple cases,
   <application>pg_dump</application> is generally not the right choice for
   taking regular backups of production databases.  See <xref
   linkend="backup"/> for further discussion.
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</application> only dumps a single database.
   To export an entire cluster, or to export global objects that are
   common to all databases in a cluster (such as roles and tablespaces),
   use <xref linkend="app-pg-dumpall"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script
   dumps are plain-text files containing the SQL commands required
   to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was
   saved. To restore from such a script, feed it to <xref
   linkend="app-psql"/>. Script files
   can be used to reconstruct the database even on other machines and
   other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL
   database products.
  </para>

  <para>
   The alternative archive file formats must be used with
   <xref linkend="app-pgrestore"/> to rebuild the database.  They
   allow <application>pg_restore</application> to be selective about
   what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being
   restored.
   The archive file formats are designed to be portable across
   architectures.
  </para>

  <para>
   When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
   <application>pg_restore</application>,
   <application>pg_dump</application> provides a flexible archival and
   transfer mechanism. <application>pg_dump</application> can be used to
   export an entire database, then <application>pg_restore</application>
   can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the
   database are to be restored. The most flexible output file formats are
   the <quote>custom</quote> format (<option>-Fc</option>) and the
   <quote>directory</quote> format (<option>-Fd</option>). They allow
   for selection and reordering of all archived items, support parallel
   restoration, and are compressed by default. The <quote>directory</quote>
   format is the only format that supports parallel dumps.
  </para>

  <para>
   While running <application>pg_dump</application>, one should examine the
   output for any warnings (printed on standard error), especially in
   light of the limitations listed below.

        Specifies the name of the database to be dumped.  If this is
        not specified, the environment variable
        <envar>PGDATABASE</envar> is used.  If that is not set, the
        user name specified for the connection is used.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Include large objects in the dump.  This is the default behavior
        except when <option>--schema</option>, <option>--table</option>, or
        <option>--schema-only</option> is specified.  The <option>-b</option>
        switch is therefore only useful to add large objects to dumps
        where a specific schema or table has been requested.  Note that
        large objects are considered data and therefore will be included when
        <option>--data-only</option> is used, but not
        when <option>--schema-only</option> is.

       <para>
        Output commands to <command>DROP</command> all the dumped
        database objects prior to outputting the commands for creating them.
        This option is useful when the restore is to overwrite an existing
        database.  If any of the objects do not exist in the destination
        database, ignorable error messages will be reported during
        restore, unless <option>--if-exists</option> is also specified.
       </para>

       <para>
        This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output
        file.  For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you
        call <command>pg_restore</command>.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Begin the output with a command to create the
        database itself and reconnect to the created database.  (With a
        script of this form, it doesn't matter which database in the
        destination installation you connect to before running the script.)
        If <option>--clean</option> is also specified, the script drops and
        recreates the target database before reconnecting to it.
       </para>

       <para>
        With <option>--create</option>, the output also includes the
        database's comment if any, and any configuration variable settings
        that are specific to this database, that is,
        any <command>ALTER DATABASE ... SET ...</command>
        and <command>ALTER ROLE ... IN DATABASE ... SET ...</command>
        commands that mention this database.
        Access privileges for the database itself are also dumped,
        unless <option>--no-acl</option> is specified.
       </para>

       <para>
        This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output
        file.  For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you
        call <command>pg_restore</command>.

       <para>
        Dump only extensions matching <replaceable
        class="parameter">pattern</replaceable>.  When this option is not
        specified, all non-system extensions in the target database will be
        dumped.  Multiple extensions can be selected by writing multiple
        <option>-e</option> switches.  The <replaceable
        class="parameter">pattern</replaceable> parameter is interpreted as a
        pattern according to the same rules used by
        <application>psql</application>'s <literal>\d</literal> commands (see
        <xref linkend="app-psql-patterns"/>), so multiple extensions can also
        be selected by writing wildcard characters in the pattern.  When using
        wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent the
        shell from expanding the wildcards.
       </para>

       <para>
        Any configuration relation registered by
        <function>pg_extension_config_dump</function> is included in the
        dump if its extension is specified by <option>--extension</option>.
       </para>

       <note>
        <para>
         When <option>-e</option> is specified,
         <application>pg_dump</application> makes no attempt to dump any other
         database objects that the selected extension(s) might depend upon.
         Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a
         specific-extension dump can be successfully restored by themselves
         into a clean database.

           <application>pg_restore</application>.
           Together with the directory output format, this is the most flexible
           output format in that it allows manual selection and reordering of
           archived items during restore. This format is also compressed by
           default.

           Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into

           with one file for each table and large object being dumped, plus a
           so-called Table of Contents file describing the dumped objects in a
           machine-readable format that <application>pg_restore</application>
           can read. A directory format archive can be manipulated with
           standard Unix tools; for example, files in an uncompressed archive
           can be compressed with the <application>gzip</application>,
           <application>lz4</application>, or
           <application>zstd</application> tools.
           This format is compressed by default using <literal>gzip</literal>
           and also supports parallel dumps.

          <para>
           Output a <command>tar</command>-format archive suitable for input
           into <application>pg_restore</application>. The tar format is
           compatible with the directory format: extracting a tar-format
           archive produces a valid directory-format archive.
           However, the tar format does not support compression. Also, when
           using tar format the relative order of table data items cannot be
           changed during restore.

        Run the dump in parallel by dumping <replaceable class="parameter">njobs</replaceable>
        tables simultaneously. This option may reduce the time needed to perform the dump but it also
        increases the load on the database server. You can only use this option with the
        directory output format because this is the only output format where multiple processes
        can write their data at the same time.
       </para>
       <para><application>pg_dump</application> will open <replaceable class="parameter">njobs</replaceable>

        setting is high enough to accommodate all connections.
       </para>
       <para>
        Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could
        cause the dump to fail. The reason is that the <application>pg_dump</application> leader process
        requests shared locks (<link linkend="locking-tables">ACCESS SHARE</link>) on the
        objects that the worker processes are going to dump later in order to
        make sure that nobody deletes them and makes them go away while the dump is running.
        If another client then requests an exclusive lock on a table, that lock will not be
        granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the leader process to be
        released. Consequently any other access to the table will not be granted either and
        will queue after the exclusive lock request. This includes the worker process trying
        to dump the table. Without any precautions this would be a classic deadlock situation.
        To detect this conflict, the <application>pg_dump</application> worker process requests another
        shared lock using the <literal>NOWAIT</literal> option. If the worker process is not granted
        this shared lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in the meantime
        and there is no way to continue with the dump, so <application>pg_dump</application> has no choice
        but to abort the dump.
       </para>
       <para>
        To perform a parallel dump, the database server needs to support
        synchronized snapshots, a feature that was introduced in
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.2 for primary servers and 10
        for standbys. With this feature, database clients can ensure they see
        the same data set even though they use different connections.
        <command>pg_dump -j</command> uses multiple database connections; it
        connects to the database once with the leader process and once again
        for each worker job. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the
        different worker jobs wouldn't be guaranteed to see the same data in
        each connection, which could lead to an inconsistent backup.

        Dump only schemas matching <replaceable

        interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
        <application>psql</application>'s <literal>\d</literal> commands
        (see <xref linkend="app-psql-patterns"/>),
        so multiple schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters
        in the pattern.  When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern

        Dump only tables with names matching

        can be selected by writing multiple <option>-t</option> switches.  The
        <replaceable class="parameter">pattern</replaceable> parameter is
        interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
        <application>psql</application>'s <literal>\d</literal> commands
        (see <xref linkend="app-psql-patterns"/>),
        so multiple tables can also be selected by writing wildcard characters
        in the pattern.  When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern
        if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcards;  see
        <xref linkend="pg-dump-examples"/> below.
       </para>

       <para>
        As well as tables, this option can be used to dump the definition of matching
        views, materialized views, foreign tables, and sequences.  It will not dump the
        contents of views or materialized views, and the contents of foreign tables will
        only be dumped if the corresponding foreign server is specified with
        <option>--include-foreign-data</option>.
       </para>

       <para>
        The <option>-n</option> and <option>-N</option> switches have no effect when
        <option>-t</option> is used, because tables selected by <option>-t</option> will
        be dumped regardless of those switches, and non-table objects will not
        be dumped.

       <note>
        <para>
         When <option>-t</option> is specified, <application>pg_dump</application>
         makes no attempt to dump any other database objects that the selected
         table(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee
         that the results of a specific-table dump can be successfully
         restored by themselves into a clean database.

        The compression method can be set to <literal>gzip</literal>,
        <literal>lz4</literal>, <literal>zstd</literal>,
        or <literal>none</literal> for no compression.
        A compression detail string can optionally be specified.  If the
        detail string is an integer, it specifies the compression level.
        Otherwise, it should be a comma-separated list of items, each of the
        form <literal>keyword</literal> or <literal>keyword=value</literal>.
        Currently, the supported keywords are <literal>level</literal> and

       <para>
        If no compression level is specified, the default compression
        level will be used. If only a level is specified without mentioning
        an algorithm, <literal>gzip</literal> compression will be used if
        the level is greater than <literal>0</literal>, and no compression
        will be used if the level is <literal>0</literal>.
       </para>

       <para>
        For the custom and directory archive formats, this specifies compression of
        individual table-data segments, and the default is to compress using
        <literal>gzip</literal> at a moderate level. For plain text output,
        setting a nonzero compression level causes the entire output file to be compressed,
        as though it had been fed through <application>gzip</application>,
        <application>lz4</application>, or <application>zstd</application>;
        but the default is not to compress.
        With zstd compression, <literal>long</literal> mode may improve the
        compression ratio, at the cost of increased memory use.

        It instructs <application>pg_dump</application> to include commands
        to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while
        the data is restored.  Use this if you have referential
        integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you
        do not want to invoke during data restore.

       <para>
        Presently, the commands emitted for <option>--disable-triggers</option>

       <para>
        Dump data as <command>INSERT</command> commands (rather
        than <command>COPY</command>).  This will make restoration very slow;
        it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
        non-<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> databases.
        Any error during restoring will cause only rows that are part of the
        problematic <command>INSERT</command> to be lost, rather than the
        entire table contents.  Note that the restore might fail altogether if
        you have rearranged column order.  The
        <option>--column-inserts</option> option is safe against column order
        changes, though even slower.

       <para>
        When dumping data for a table partition, make
        the <command>COPY</command> or <command>INSERT</command> statements
        target the root of the partitioning hierarchy that contains it, rather
        than the partition itself.  This causes the appropriate partition to
        be re-determined for each row when the data is loaded.  This may be
        useful when restoring data on a server where rows do not always fall
        into the same partitions as they did on the original server.  That
        could happen, for example, if the partitioning column is of type text
        and the two systems have different definitions of the collation used
        to sort the partitioning column.

        identifiers that are reserved words in its own major version.
        This sometimes results in compatibility issues when dealing with
        servers of other versions that may have slightly different sets

        Use a <literal>serializable</literal> transaction for the dump, to

       <para>
        This option is not beneficial for a dump which is intended only for

        copy of the database for reporting or other read-only load sharing
        while the original database continues to be updated.  Without it the
        dump may reflect a state which is not consistent with any serial
        execution of the transactions eventually committed.  For example, if
        batch processing techniques are used, a batch may show as closed in
        the dump without all of the items which are in the batch appearing.

        This option will make no difference if there are no read-write

        indeterminate length of time.  Once running, performance with or

   The database activity of <application>pg_dump</application> is
   normally collected by the cumulative statistics system.  If this is
   undesirable, you can set parameter <varname>track_counts</varname>
   to false via <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> or the <literal>ALTER
   USER</literal> command.

  <para>
   If your database cluster has any local additions to the <literal>template1</literal> database,
   be careful to restore the output of <application>pg_dump</application> into a
   truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to
   duplicate definitions of the added objects.  To make an empty database
   without any local additions, copy from <literal>template0</literal> not <literal>template1</literal>,
   for example:
<programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   When a data-only dump is chosen and the option <option>--disable-triggers</option>
   is used, <application>pg_dump</application> emits commands
   to disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data,
   and then commands to re-enable them after the data has been
   inserted.  If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system
   catalogs might be left in the wrong state.
  </para>

  <para>
   The dump file produced by <application>pg_dump</application>
   does not contain the statistics used by the optimizer to make
   query planning decisions.  Therefore, it is wise to run
   <command>ANALYZE</command> after restoring from a dump file
   to ensure optimal performance; see <xref linkend="vacuum-for-statistics"/>
   and <xref linkend="autovacuum"/> for more information.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because <application>pg_dump</application> is used to transfer data
   to newer versions of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, the output of
   <application>pg_dump</application> can be expected to load into
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server versions newer than
   <application>pg_dump</application>'s version.  <application>pg_dump</application> can also
   dump from <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers older than its own version.
   (Currently, servers back to version 9.2 are supported.)
   However, <application>pg_dump</application> cannot dump from
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers newer than its own major version;
   it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump.
   Also, it is not guaranteed that <application>pg_dump</application>'s output can
   be loaded into a server of an older major version &mdash; not even if the
   dump was taken from a server of that version.  Loading a dump file
   into an older server may require manual editing of the dump file
   to remove syntax not understood by the older server.
   Use of the <option>--quote-all-identifiers</option> option is recommended
   in cross-version cases, as it can prevent problems arising from varying
   reserved-word lists in different <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> versions.
  </para>

  <para>
   When dumping logical replication subscriptions,
   <application>pg_dump</application> will generate <command>CREATE
   SUBSCRIPTION</command> commands that use the <literal>connect = false</literal>
   option, so that restoring the subscription does not make remote connections
   for creating a replication slot or for initial table copy.  That way, the
   dump can be restored without requiring network access to the remote
   servers.  It is then up to the user to reactivate the subscriptions in a
   suitable way.  If the involved hosts have changed, the connection
   information might have to be changed.  It might also be appropriate to
   truncate the target tables before initiating a new full table copy.  If users
   intend to copy initial data during refresh they must create the slot with
   <literal>two_phase = false</literal>.  After the initial sync, the
   <link linkend="sql-createsubscription-params-with-two-phase"><literal>two_phase</literal></link>
   option will be automatically enabled by the subscriber if the subscription
   had been originally created with <literal>two_phase = true</literal> option.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is generally recommended to use the <option>-X</option>
   (<option>--no-psqlrc</option>) option when restoring a database from a
   plain-text <application>pg_dump</application> script to ensure a clean
   restore process and prevent potential conflicts with
   non-default <application>psql</application> configurations.

</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To reload such a script into a (freshly created) database named
   <literal>newdb</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>psql -X -d newdb -f db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a database into a custom-format archive file:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -Fc mydb &gt; db.dump</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a database into a directory-format archive:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -Fd mydb -f dumpdir</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a database into a directory-format archive in parallel with
   5 worker jobs:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -Fd mydb -j 5 -f dumpdir</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To reload an archive file into a (freshly created) database named
   <literal>newdb</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_restore -d newdb db.dump</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To reload an archive file into the same database it was dumped from,
   discarding the current contents of that database:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_restore -d postgres --clean --create db.dump</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a single table named <literal>mytab</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t mytab mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all tables whose names start with <literal>emp</literal> in the
   <literal>detroit</literal> schema, except for the table named
   <literal>employee_log</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t 'detroit.emp*' -T detroit.employee_log mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all schemas whose names start with <literal>east</literal> or
   <literal>west</literal> and end in <literal>gsm</literal>, excluding any schemas whose
   names contain the word <literal>test</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -n 'east*gsm' -n 'west*gsm' -N '*test*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   The same, using regular expression notation to consolidate the switches:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -n '(east|west)*gsm' -N '*test*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all database objects except for tables whose names begin with
   <literal>ts_</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -T 'ts_*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To specify an upper-case or mixed-case name in <option>-t</option> and related
   switches, you need to double-quote the name; else it will be folded to
   lower case (see <xref linkend="app-psql-patterns"/>).  But
   double quotes are special to the shell, so in turn they must be quoted.
   Thus, to dump a single table with a mixed-case name, you need something
   like

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t "\"MixedCaseName\"" mydb &gt; mytab.sql</userinput>
</screen></para>

  <para>
   To dump all tables whose names start with <literal>mytable</literal>, except
   for table <literal>mytable2</literal>, specify a filter file
   <filename>filter.txt</filename> like:
<programlisting>
include table mytable*
exclude table mytable2
</programlisting>

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump --filter=filter.txt mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen></para>
