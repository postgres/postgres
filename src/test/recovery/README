Regression tests for recovery and replication
=============================================

This directory contains a test suite for recovery and replication,
testing mainly the interactions of recovery.conf with cluster
instances by providing a simple set of routines that can be used
to define a custom cluster for a test, including backup, archiving,
and streaming configuration.

Running the tests
=================

    make check

NOTE: This creates a temporary installation, and some tests may
create one or multiple nodes, be they master or standby(s) for the
purpose of the tests.

NOTE: This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.
