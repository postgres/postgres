This can format all PostgreSQL *.c and *.h files, but excludes *.y, and *.l
files.

To use pgindent:

1) Build the source tree with _debug_ symbols and all possible configure options

2) Install to /usr/local/pgsql

3) Install all contrib modules

4) Save a list of typedefs by running:

	src/tools/find_typedef /usr/local/pgsql/bin /usr/local/pgsql/lib > /tmp/pgtypedefs

5) Run 'gmake distclean' from the top of the source tree to remove any
   derived C files.

6) From the top of the source tree, run:

	find . -name '*.[ch]' -type f -print |
	egrep -v '/s_lock.h|/ecpg/test/expected/|/snowball/libstemmer/' |
	xargs -n100 pgindent /tmp/pgtypedefs

We have standardized on NetBSD's indent.  We have fixed a few bugs which 
requre the NetBSD source to be patched with indent.bsd.patch patch.  A 
fully patched  version is available at ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/dev.

GNU indent, version 2.2.6, has several problems, and is not recommended.
These bugs become pretty major when you are doing >500k lines of code.
If you don't believe me, take a directory and make a copy.  Run pgindent
on the copy using GNU indent, and do a diff -r. You will see what I
mean. GNU indent does some things better, but mangles too.

Notes about excluded files:

src/include/storage/s_lock.h is excluded because it contains assembly code
that pgindent tends to mess up.

src/interfaces/ecpg/test/expected/ is excluded to avoid breaking the ecpg
regression tests.

src/include/snowball/libstemmer/ and src/backend/snowball/libstemmer/
are excluded because those files are imported from an external project,
not maintained locally, and are machine-generated anyway.
