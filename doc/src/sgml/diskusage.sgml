<chapter id="diskusage">
 <title>Monitoring Disk Usage</title>

 <para>
  This chapter discusses how to monitor the disk usage of a
  <productname>PostgreSQL</> database system.  In the current
  release, the database administrator does not have much control over
  the on-disk storage layout, so this chapter is mostly informative
  and can give you some ideas how to manage the disk usage with
  operating system tools.
 </para>

 <sect1 id="disk-usage">
  <title>Determining Disk Usage</Title>

  <indexterm zone="disk-usage">
   <primary>disk usage</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Each table has a primary heap disk file where most of the data is
   stored. To store long column values, there is also a
   <acronym>TOAST</> file associated with the table, named based on the
   table's OID (actually <literal>pg_class.relfilenode</>), and an index on the
   <acronym>TOAST</> table. There also may be indexes associated with
   the base table.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can monitor disk space from three places: from
   <application>psql</> using <command>VACUUM</> information, from
   <application>psql</> using the tools in <filename>contrib/dbsize</>, and from
   the command line using the tools in <filename>contrib/oid2name</>. Using
   <application>psql</> on a recently vacuumed or analyzed database,
   you can issue queries to see the disk usage of any table:
<programlisting>
SELECT relfilenode, relpages FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'customer';

 relfilenode | relpages 
-------------+----------
       16806 |       60
(1 row)
</programlisting>
   Each page is typically 8 kilobytes. (Remember, <literal>relpages</>
   is only updated by <command>VACUUM</> and <command>ANALYZE</>.)
  </para>

  <para>
   To show the space used by <acronym>TOAST</> tables, use a query
   like the following, substituting the <literal>relfilenode</literal>
   number of the heap (determined by the query above):
<programlisting>
SELECT relname, relpages
    FROM pg_class
    WHERE relname = 'pg_toast_16806' OR relname = 'pg_toast_16806_index'
    ORDER BY relname;

       relname        | relpages 
----------------------+----------
 pg_toast_16806       |        0
 pg_toast_16806_index |        1
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   You can easily display index sizes, too:
<programlisting>
SELECT c2.relname, c2.relpages
    FROM pg_class c, pg_class c2, pg_index i
    WHERE c.relname = 'customer'
        AND c.oid = i.indrelid
        AND c2.oid = i.indexrelid
        ORDER BY c2.relname;

       relname        | relpages 
----------------------+----------
 customer_id_indexdex |       26
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   It is easy to find your largest tables and indexes using this
   information:
<programlisting>
SELECT relname, relpages FROM pg_class ORDER BY relpages DESC;

       relname        | relpages 
----------------------+----------
 bigtable             |     3290
 customer             |     3144
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   <filename>contrib/dbsize</> loads functions into your database that allow
   you to find the size of a table or database from inside
   <application>psql</> without the need for <command>VACUUM</> or <command>ANALYZE</>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can also use <filename>contrib/oid2name</> to show disk usage. See
   <filename>README.oid2name</> in that directory for examples. It includes a script that
   shows disk usage for each database.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="disk-full">
  <title>Disk Full Failure</title>

  <para>
   The most important disk monitoring task of a database administrator
   is to make sure the disk doesn't grow full.  A filled data disk may
   result in subsequent corruption of database indexes, but not of the
   tables themselves. If the WAL files are on the same disk (as
   is the case for a default configuration) then a filled disk during
   database initialization may result in corrupted or incomplete WAL
   files. This failure condition is detected and the database server
   will refuse to start up.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you cannot free up additional space on the disk by deleting
   other things you can move some of the database files to other file
   systems and create a symlink from the original location.  But
   note that <application>pg_dump</> cannot save the location layout
   information of such a setup; a restore would put everything back in
   one place.  To avoid running out of disk space, you can place the
   WAL files or individual databases in other locations while creating
   them.  See the <command>initdb</> documentation and <xref
   linkend="manage-ag-alternate-locs"> for more information about that.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    Some file systems perform badly when they are almost full, so do
    not wait until the disk is full to take action.
