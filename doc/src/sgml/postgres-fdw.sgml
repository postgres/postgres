 <para>
  The <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> module provides the foreign-data wrapper
  <literal>postgres_fdw</literal>, which can be used to access data
  stored in external <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers.
 </para>

 <para>
  The functionality provided by this module overlaps substantially
  with the functionality of the older <xref linkend="dblink"/> module.
  But <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> provides more transparent and
  standards-compliant syntax for accessing remote tables, and can give
  better performance in many cases.
 </para>

 <para>
  To prepare for remote access using <filename>postgres_fdw</filename>:
  <orderedlist spacing="compact">

     Create a foreign server object, using <xref linkend="sql-createserver"/>,
     to represent each remote database you want to connect to.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Create a user mapping, using <xref linkend="sql-createusermapping"/>, for
     each database user you want to allow to access each foreign server.
     Specify the remote user name and password to use as
     <literal>user</literal> and <literal>password</literal> options of the
     user mapping.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Create a foreign table, using <xref linkend="sql-createforeigntable"/>
     or <xref linkend="sql-importforeignschema"/>,
     for each remote table you want to access.  The columns of the foreign
     table must match the referenced remote table.  You can, however, use
     table and/or column names different from the remote table's, if you
     specify the correct remote names as options of the foreign table object.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
 </para>

 <para>
  Now you need only <command>SELECT</command> from a foreign table to access
  the data stored in its underlying remote table.  You can also modify
  the remote table using <command>INSERT</command>, <command>UPDATE</command>,
  <command>DELETE</command>, <command>COPY</command>, or
  <command>TRUNCATE</command>.
  (Of course, the remote user you have specified in your user mapping must
  have privileges to do these things.)
 </para>

 <para>
  Note that the <literal>ONLY</literal> option specified in
  <command>SELECT</command>, <command>UPDATE</command>,
  <command>DELETE</command> or <command>TRUNCATE</command>
  has no effect when accessing or modifying the remote table.
 </para>

 <para>
  Note that <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> currently lacks support for
  <command>INSERT</command> statements with an <literal>ON CONFLICT DO
  UPDATE</literal> clause.  However, the <literal>ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING</literal>
  clause is supported, provided a unique index inference specification
  is omitted.
  Note also that <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> supports row movement
  invoked by <command>UPDATE</command> statements executed on partitioned
  tables, but it currently does not handle the case where a remote partition
  chosen to insert a moved row into is also an <command>UPDATE</command>
  target partition that will be updated elsewhere in the same command.
 </para>

 <para>
  It is generally recommended that the columns of a foreign table be declared
  with exactly the same data types, and collations if applicable, as the
  referenced columns of the remote table.  Although <filename>postgres_fdw</filename>
  is currently rather forgiving about performing data type conversions at
  need, surprising semantic anomalies may arise when types or collations do
  not match, due to the remote server interpreting query conditions
  differently from the local server.
 </para>

 <para>
  Note that a foreign table can be declared with fewer columns, or with a
  different column order, than its underlying remote table has.  Matching
  of columns to the remote table is by name, not position.

   <title>Cost Estimation Options</title>

   <para>
    <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> retrieves remote data by executing queries
    against remote servers, so ideally the estimated cost of scanning a
    foreign table should be whatever it costs to be done on the remote
    server, plus some overhead for communication.  The most reliable way to
    get such an estimate is to ask the remote server and then add something
    for overhead &mdash; but for simple queries, it may not be worth the cost
    of an additional remote query to get a cost estimate.
    So <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> provides the following options to control
    how cost estimation is done:

       A setting for a foreign table overrides any setting for its server,

       This option, which can be specified for a foreign server, is a floating
       point value that is added to the estimated startup cost of any
       foreign-table scan on that server.  This represents the additional
       overhead of establishing a connection, parsing and planning the query on
       the remote side, etc.

       This option, which can be specified for a foreign server, is a floating

    When <literal>use_remote_estimate</literal> is true,

    <literal>use_remote_estimate</literal> is false,
    <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> performs local row count and cost estimation
    and then adds <literal>fdw_startup_cost</literal> and
    <literal>fdw_tuple_cost</literal> to the cost estimates.  This local
    estimation is unlikely to be very accurate unless local copies of the
    remote table's statistics are available.  Running
    <xref linkend="sql-analyze"/> on the foreign table is the way to update
    the local statistics; this will perform a scan of the remote table and
    then calculate and store statistics just as though the table were local.
    Keeping local statistics can be a useful way to reduce per-query planning
    overhead for a remote table &mdash; but if the remote table is
    frequently updated, the local statistics will soon be obsolete.

   <para>
    <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> supports asynchronous execution, which

       In order to ensure that the data being returned from a foreign server

       Asynchronous execution is applied even when an

       In such a case, if the asynchronous subplans are ones processed using
       <filename>postgres_fdw</filename>, tuples from the asynchronous
       subplans are not returned until after at least one synchronous subplan
       returns all tuples, as that subplan is executed while the asynchronous
       subplans are waiting for the results of asynchronous queries sent to
       foreign servers.
       This behavior might change in a future release.

    foreign table definitions on the local server that match tables or

    Note that constraints other than <literal>NOT NULL</literal> will never be

    provision for importing them automatically, because of the risk that a
    constraint expression could evaluate differently on the local and remote
    servers.  Any such inconsistency in the behavior of a check
    constraint could lead to hard-to-detect errors in query optimization.
    So if you wish to import check constraints, you must do so
    manually, and you should verify the semantics of each one carefully.

    foreign tables, see <xref linkend="sql-createforeigntable"/>.

    Since all data can be accessed through the partitioned table
    which is the root of the partitioning hierarchy, importing only
    partitioned tables should allow access to all the data without
    creating extra objects.

   associated with the foreign server.  By default this connection
   is kept and re-used for subsequent queries in the same session.
   This behavior can be controlled using
   <literal>keep_connections</literal> option for a foreign server. If
   multiple user identities (user mappings) are used to access the foreign
   server, a connection is established for each user mapping.

  <para>
   When changing the definition of or removing a foreign server or
   a user mapping, the associated connections are closed.
   But note that if any connections are in use in the current local transaction,

   Closed connections will be re-established when they are necessary
   by future queries using a foreign table.

   Once a connection to a foreign server has been established,

  <title>Transaction Management</title>

  <para>
   During a query that references any remote tables on a foreign server,
   <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> opens a transaction on the
   remote server if one is not already open corresponding to the current
   local transaction.  The remote transaction is committed or aborted when
   the local transaction commits or aborts.  Savepoints are similarly
   managed by creating corresponding remote savepoints.
  </para>

  <para>
   The remote transaction uses <literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal>
   isolation level when the local transaction has <literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal>
   isolation level; otherwise it uses <literal>REPEATABLE READ</literal>
   isolation level.  This choice ensures that if a query performs multiple
   table scans on the remote server, it will get snapshot-consistent results
   for all the scans.  A consequence is that successive queries within a
   single transaction will see the same data from the remote server, even if
   concurrent updates are occurring on the remote server due to other
   activities.  That behavior would be expected anyway if the local
   transaction uses <literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal> or <literal>REPEATABLE READ</literal>
   isolation level, but it might be surprising for a <literal>READ
   COMMITTED</literal> local transaction.  A future

  <title>Remote Query Optimization</title>

  <para>
   <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> attempts to optimize remote queries to reduce
   the amount of data transferred from foreign servers.  This is done by
   sending query <literal>WHERE</literal> clauses to the remote server for
   execution, and by not retrieving table columns that are not needed for
   the current query.  To reduce the risk of misexecution of queries,
   <literal>WHERE</literal> clauses are not sent to the remote server unless they use
   only data types, operators, and functions that are built-in or belong to an
   extension that's listed in the foreign server's <literal>extensions</literal>
   option.  Operators and functions in such clauses must
   be <literal>IMMUTABLE</literal> as well.
   For an <command>UPDATE</command> or <command>DELETE</command> query,
   <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> attempts to optimize the query execution by
   sending the whole query to the remote server if there are no query
   <literal>WHERE</literal> clauses that cannot be sent to the remote server,
   no local joins for the query, no row-level local <literal>BEFORE</literal> or
   <literal>AFTER</literal> triggers or stored generated columns on the target

   A limitation however is that <filename>postgres_fdw</filename>
   generally assumes that immutable built-in functions and operators are

   rewriting the query, for example by embedding the foreign table
   reference in a sub-<literal>SELECT</literal> with <literal>OFFSET 0</literal> as an
   optimization fence, and placing the problematic function or operator

  <title>Examples</title>

  <para>
   Here is an example of creating a foreign table with
   <literal>postgres_fdw</literal>. First install the extension:
  </para>

<programlisting>
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;
</programlisting>

  <para>
   Then create a foreign server using <xref linkend="sql-createserver"/>.
   In this example we wish to connect to a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server
   on host <literal>192.83.123.89</literal> listening on
   port <literal>5432</literal>.  The database to which the connection is made
   is named <literal>foreign_db</literal> on the remote server:

<programlisting>
CREATE SERVER foreign_server
        FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
        OPTIONS (host '192.83.123.89', port '5432', dbname 'foreign_db');
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   A user mapping, defined with <xref linkend="sql-createusermapping"/>, is
   needed as well to identify the role that will be used on the remote
   server:

<programlisting>
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR local_user
        SERVER foreign_server
        OPTIONS (user 'foreign_user', password 'password');
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Now it is possible to create a foreign table with
   <xref linkend="sql-createforeigntable"/>.  In this example we
   wish to access the table named <structname>some_schema.some_table</structname>
   on the remote server.  The local name for it will
   be <structname>foreign_table</structname>:

<programlisting>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_table (
        id integer NOT NULL,
        data text
)
        SERVER foreign_server
        OPTIONS (schema_name 'some_schema', table_name 'some_table');
</programlisting>

   It's essential that the data types and other properties of the columns
   declared in <command>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</command> match the actual remote table.
   Column names must match as well, unless you attach <literal>column_name</literal>
   options to the individual columns to show how they are named in the remote
   table.
   In many cases, use of <link linkend="sql-importforeignschema"><command>IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA</command></link> is
   preferable to constructing foreign table definitions manually.
