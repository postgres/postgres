   <para>
    Welcome to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and the
    <citetitle>PostgreSQL Tutorial</citetitle>.  The following few
    chapters are intended to give a simple introduction to
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, relational database
    concepts, and the SQL language to those who are new to any one of
    these aspects.  We only assume some general knowledge about how to
    use computers.  No particular Unix or programming experience is
    required.  This book is mainly intended to give you a hands-on
    experience with important aspects of the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> system.  It makes no attempt
    to be a complete or thorough treatment of the topics it covers.
   </para>

   <para>
    After you have worked through this tutorial you might want to move
    on to reading the &cite-user; to gain a more formal knowledge of
    the SQL language, or the &cite-programmer; for information about
    developing applications for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
    Those who set up and manage their own server should also read the
    &cite-admin;.
