 <title>Backup and Restore</title>

 <para>
  As everything that contains valuable data, <productname>Postgres</>
  databases should be backed up regularly. While the procedure is
  essentially simple, it is important to have a basic understanding of
  the underlying techniques and assumptions.
 </para>

 <para>
  There are two fundamentally different approaches to backing up
  <productname>Postgres</> data:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><acronym>SQL</> dump</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>File system level backup</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </para>

 <sect1 id="backup-dump">
  <title><acronym>SQL</> Dump</title>

  <para>
   The idea behind this method is to generate a text file with SQL
   commands that, when fed back to the server, will recreate the
   database in the same state as it was at the time of the dump.
   <productname>Postgres</> provides the utility program
   <application>pg_dump</> for this purpose. The basic usage of this
   command is:
<synopsis>
pg_dump <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> &gt; <replaceable class="parameter">outfile</replaceable>
</synopsis>
   As you see, <application>pg_dump</> writes its results to the
   standard output. We will see below how this can be useful.
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</> is a regular <productname>Postgres</>
   client application (albeit a particularly clever one). This means
   that you can do this backup procedure from any remote host that has
   access to the database. But remember that <application>pg_dump</>
   does not operate with special permissions. In particular, you must
   have read access to all tables that you want to back up, so in
   practice you almost always have to be a database superuser.
  </para>

  <para>
   To specify which database server <application>pg_dump</> should
   contact, use the command line options <option>-h
   <replaceable>host</></> and <option>-p <replaceable>port</></>. The
   default host is the local host or whatever your
   <envar>PGHOST</envar> environment variable specifies. Similarly,
   the default port is indicated by the <envar>PGPORT</envar>
   environment variable or, failing that, by the compiled-in default.
   (Conveniently, the server will normally have the same compiled-in
   default.)
  </para>

  <para>
   As any other <productname>Postgres</> client application,
   <application>pg_dump</> will by default connect with the database
   user name that is equal to the current Unix user name. To override
   this, either specify the <option>-u</option> option to force a prompt for
   the user name, or set the environment variable
   <envar>PGUSER</envar>. Remember that <application>pg_dump</>
   connections are subject to the normal client authentication
   mechanisms (which are described in <xref
   linkend="client-authentication">).
  </para>

  <para>
   Dumps created by <application>pg_dump</> are internally consistent,
   that is, updates to the database while <application>pg_dump</> is
   running will not be in the dump. <application>pg_dump</> does not
   block other operations on the database while it is working.
   (Exceptions are those operations that need to operate with an
   exclusive lock, such as <command>VACUUM</command>.)
  </para>

  <important>
   <para>
    When your database schema relies on OIDs (for instances as foreign
    keys) you must instruct <application>pg_dump</> to dump the OIDs
    as well. To do this, use the <option>-o</option> command line
    option.
   </para>
  </important>

  <sect2>
   <title>Restoring the dump</title>

   <para>
    The text files created by <application>pg_dump</> are intended to
    be read in by the <application>psql</application> program. The
    general command form to restore a dump is
<synopsis>
psql <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> &lt; <replaceable class="parameter">infile</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    where <replaceable class="parameter">infile</replaceable> is what
    you used as <replaceable class="parameter">outfile</replaceable>
    for the pg_dump command. The database <replaceable
    class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> will not be created by this
    command, you must do that yourself before executing
    <application>psql</> (e.g., with <userinput>createdb <replaceable
    class="parameter">dbname</></userinput>). <application>psql</>
    supports similar options to <application>pg_dump</> for
    controlling the database server location and the user names. See
    its reference page for more information.
   </para>

   <para>
    If the objects in the original database were owned by different
    users, then the dump will instruct <application>psql</> to connect
    as each affected user in turn and then create the relevant
    objects. This way the original ownership is preserved. This also
    means, however, that all these user must already exist, and
    furthermore that you must be allowed to connect as each of them.
    It might therefore be necessary to temporarily relax the client
    authentication settings.
   </para>

   <para>
    The ability of <application>pg_dump</> and <application>psql</> to
    write or read from pipes also make it possible to dump a database
    directory from one server to another, for example
    <informalexample>
<programlisting>
pg_dump -h <replaceable>host1</> <replaceable>dbname</> | psql -h <replaceable>host2</> <replaceable>dbname</>
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Using <command>pg_dumpall</></title>

   <para>
    The above mechanism is cumbersome and inappropriate when backing
    up an entire database cluster. For this reason the
    <application>pg_dumpall</> program is provided.
    <application>pg_dumpall</> backs up each database in a given
    cluster and also makes sure that the state of global data such as
    users and groups is preserved. The call sequence for
    <application>pg_dumpall</> is simply
<synopsis>
pg_dumpall &gt; <replaceable>outfile</>
</synopsis>
    The resulting dumps can be restored with <application>psql</> as
    described above. But in this case it is definitely necessary that
    you have database superuser access, as that is required to restore
    the user and group information.
   </para>

   <para>
    <application>pg_dumpall</application> has one little flaw: It is
    not prepared for interactively authenticating to each database it
    dumps. If you are using password authentication then you need to
    set it the environment variable <envar>PGPASSWORD</envar> to
    communicate the password the the underlying calls to
    <application>pg_dump</>. More severely, if you have different
    passwords set up for each database, then
    <application>pg_dumpall</> will fail. You can either choose a
    different authentication mechanism for the purposes of backup or
    adjust the <filename>pg_dumpall</filename> shell script to your
    needs.
   </para>

    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Since <productname>Postgres</productname> allows tables larger
    than the maximum file size on your system, it can be problematic
    to dump the table to a file, since the resulting file will likely
    be larger than the maximum size allowed by your system. As
    <application>pg_dump</> writes to the standard output, you can
    just use standard *nix tools to work around this possible problem.
   </para>

   <formalpara>
    <title>Use compressed dumps.</title>
    <para>
     Use your favorite compression program, for example
     <application>gzip</application>.

<programlisting>
pg_dump <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> | gzip &gt; <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>.gz
</programlisting>

     Reload with

<programlisting>
createdb <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
gunzip -c <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>.gz | psql <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
</programlisting>

     or

<programlisting>
cat <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>.gz | gunzip | psql <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
</programlisting>
    </para>
   </formalpara>

   <formalpara>
    <title>Use <application>split</>.</title>
    <para>
     This allows you to split the output into pieces that are
     acceptable in size to the underlying file system. For example, to
     make chunks of 1 megabyte:

     <informalexample>
<programlisting>
pg_dump <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable> | split -b 1m - <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>
</programlisting>
     </informalexample>

     Reload with

     <informalexample>
<programlisting>
createdb <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
cat <replaceable class="parameter">filename</replaceable>.* | psql <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
</programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>
   </formalpara>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Caveats</title>

   <para>
    <application>pg_dump</> (and by implication
    <application>pg_dumpall</>) has a few limitations which stem from
    the difficulty to reconstruct certain information from the system
    catalogs.
   </para>

   <para>
    Specifically, the order in which <application>pg_dump</> writes
    the objects is not very sophisticated. This can lead to problems
    for example when functions are used as column default values. The
    only answer is to manually reorder the dump. If you created
    circular dependencies in your schema then you will have more work
    to do.
   </para>

   <para>
    Large objects are not handled by <application>pg_dump</>. The
    directory <filename>contrib/pg_dumplo</> of the
    <productname>Postgres</> source tree contains a program that can
    do that.
   </para>

   <para>
    Please familiarize yourself with the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>pg_dump</></> reference page.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="backup-file">
  <title>File system level backup</title>

  <para>
   An alternative backup strategy is to directly copy the files that
   <productname>Postgres</> uses to store the data in the database. In
   <xref linkend="creating-cluster"> it is explained where these files
   are located, but you have probably found them already if you are
   interested in this method. You can use whatever method you prefer
   for doing usual file system backups, for example
   <informalexample>
<programlisting>
tar -cf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data
</programlisting>
   </informalexample>
  </para>

  <para>
   There are two restrictions, however, which make this method
   impractical, or at least inferior to the <application>pg_dump</>
   method:

   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The database server <emphasis>must</> be shut down in order to
      get a usable backup. Half-way measures such as disallowing all
      connections will not work as there is always some buffering
      going on. For this reason it is also not advisable to trust file
      systems that claim to support <quote>consistent
      snapshots</quote>. Information about stopping the server can be
      found in <xref linkend="postmaster-shutdown">.
     </para>

     <para>
      Needless to say that you also need to shut down the server
      before restoring the data.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you have dug into the details of the file system layout you
      may be tempted to try to back up or restore only certain
      individual tables or databases from their respective files or
      directories. This will <emphasis>not</> work because the
      information contained in these files contains only half the
      truth. The other half is in the file
      <filename>pg_log</filename>, which contains the commit status of
      all transactions. A table file is only usable with this
      information. Of course it is also impossible to restore only a
      table and the associated <filename>pg_log</filename> file
      because that will render all other tables in the database
      cluster useless.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   Also note that the file system backup will not necessarily be
   smaller than an SQL dump. On the contrary, it will most likely be
   larger. (<application>pg_dump</application> does not need to dump
   the contents of indices for example, just the commands to recreate
   them.)
  </para>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="migration">
  <title>Migration between releases</title>

  <para>
   As a general rule, the internal data storage format is subject to
   change between releases of <productname>Postgres</>. This does not
   apply to different <quote>patch levels</quote>, these always have
   compatible storage formats. For example, releases 6.5.3, 7.0.1, and
   7.1 are not compatible, whereas 7.0.2 and 7.0.1 are. When you
   update between compatible versions, then you can simply reuse the
   data area in disk by the new executables. Otherwise you need to
   <quote>back up</> your data and <quote>restore</> it on the new
   server, using <application>pg_dump</>. (There are checks in place
   that prevent you from doing the wrong thing, so no harm can be done
   by confusing these things.) The precise installation procedure is
   not subject of this section, the <citetitle>Installation
   Instructions</citetitle> carry these details.
  </para>

  <para>
   The least downtime can be achieved by installing the new server in
   a different directory and running both the old and the new servers
   in parallel, on different ports. Then you can use something like
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
pg_dumpall -p 5432 | psql -d template1 -p 6543
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
   to transfer your data, or use an intermediate file if you want.
   Then you can shut down the old server and start the new server at
   the port the old one was running at. You should make sure that the
   database is not updated after you run <application>pg_dumpall</>,
   otherwise you will obviously lose that data. See <xref
   linkend="client-authentication"> for information on how to prohibit
   access. In practice you probably want to test your client
   applications on the new setup before switching over.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you cannot or do not want to run two servers in parallel you can
   do the back up step before installing the new version, bring down
   the server, move the old version out of the way, install the new
   version, start the new server, restore the data. For example:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
pg_dumpall > backup
kill -INT `cat /usr/local/pgsql/postmaster.pid`
mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old
cd /usr/src/postgresql-7.1
gmake install
initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
psql < backup
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
   See <xref linkend="runtime"> about ways to start and stop the
   server and other details. The installation instructions will advise
   you of strategic places to perform these steps.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    When you <quote>move the old installation out of the way</quote>
    it is no longer perfectly usable. Some parts of the installation
    contain information about where the other parts are located. This
    is usually not a big problem but if you plan on using two
    installations in parallel for a while you should assign them
    different installation directories at build time.
   </para>
