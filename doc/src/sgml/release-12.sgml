      Set a secure <varname>search_path</varname> in logical replication
      walsenders and apply workers (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      A malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database
      could potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role
      running replication, which is often a superuser.  Some of the risks
      here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are
      mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and
      receiver execute with empty <varname>search_path</varname> settings.
      (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for
      under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.)  Other risks
      are inherent in replicating objects that belong to untrusted roles;
      the most we can do is document that there is a hazard to consider.

      Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried
      out against an extension installation script, if the attacker can
      create objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema
      of some prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require
      superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining
      superuser privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about
      the <varname>search_path</varname> used to run an installation
      script; disable <varname>check_function_bodies</varname> within the
      script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to
      help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts
      secure.  This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on
      other extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.

     </para>

     <para>
      When there are multiple partition key columns, generation of pruning
      tests could misbehave if some columns had no
      constraining <literal>WHERE</literal> clauses or multiple
      constraining clauses.  This could lead to server crashes, incorrect

      In logical replication walsender, fix failure to send feedback

     </para>

     <para>
      This is a relatively minor problem when using built-in logical
      replication, because the built-in walreceiver will send a feedback
      reply (which clears the incorrect state) fairly frequently anyway.
      But with some other replication systems, such
      as <application>pglogical</application>, it causes significant
      performance issues.

      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The bootstrap catalog data incorrectly marks these two catalog
      columns as always non-null.  There's no easy way to correct that
      mistake in existing installations (though v13 and later will have
      the correct markings).  The main place that depends on that marking
      being correct is JIT-enabled tuple deconstruction, so teach it to
      explicitly ignore the marking for these two columns.  Also adjust
      some C code that accessed <structfield>srsublsn</structfield> without
      checking to see if it's null; a crash from that is improbable but
      perhaps not impossible.

      Use the query-specified collation for operators invoked during
      selectivity estimation (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, the collation of the underlying database column was
      used.  But using the query's collation is arguably more correct.
      More importantly, now that we have nondeterministic collations,
      there are cases where an operator will fail outright if given a
      nondeterministic collation.  We don't want planning to fail in cases
      where the query itself would work, so this means that we must use
      the query's collation when invoking operators for estimation
      purposes.

      If a concurrently-inserted tuple was updated by a different

      could draw the wrong conclusions about whether the tuple was relevant

      Fix parallel restore of tables having both table-level privileges

     <para>
      The table-level privilege grants have to be applied first, but a
      parallel restore did not reliably order them that way; this could
      lead to <quote>tuple concurrently updated</quote> errors, or to
      disappearance of some per-column privilege grants.  The fix for this
      is to include dependency links between such entries in the archive
      file, meaning that a new dump has to be taken with a
      corrected <application>pg_dump</application> to ensure that the
      problem will not recur.

      Fix possible failure with <literal>GENERATED</literal> columns
      (David Rowley)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a <literal>GENERATED</literal> column's value is an exact copy of
      another column of the table (and it is a pass-by-reference data
      type), it was possible to crash or insert corrupted data into the
      table.  While it would be rather pointless for
      a <literal>GENERATED</literal> expression to just duplicate another
      column, an expression using a function that sometimes returns its
      input unchanged could create the situation.

      Repair performance regression in
      <structname>information_schema</structname>.<structname>triggers</structname>
      view (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This patch redefines that view so that an
      outer <literal>WHERE</literal> clause constraining the table name
      can be pushed down into the view, allowing its calculations to be
      done only for triggers belonging to the table of interest rather
      than all triggers in the database.  In a database with many triggers
      this would make a significant speed difference for queries of that
      form.  Since things worked that way before v11, this is a potential
      performance regression.  Users who find this to be a problem can fix
      it by replacing the view definition (or, perhaps, just deleting and
      reinstalling the whole <structname>information_schema</structname>
      schema).

     <para>
      Since the bit number argument is only <type>int4</type>, it's
      impossible to use these functions to access bits beyond the first
      256MB of a long <type>bytea</type>.  We'll widen the argument
      to <type>int8</type> in v13, but in the meantime, allow these
      functions to work on the initial substring of a
      long <type>bytea</type>.

      Fix <command>TRUNCATE ... CASCADE</command> to ensure all relevant
      partitions are truncated (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a partition of a partitioned table is truncated with
      the <literal>CASCADE</literal> option, and the partitioned table has
      a foreign-key reference from another table, that table must also be
      truncated.  The need to check this was missed if the referencing
      table was itself partitioned, possibly allowing rows to survive that
      violate the foreign-key constraint.
     </para>

     <para>
      Hence, if you have foreign key constraints between partitioned
      tables, and you have done any
      partition-level <command>TRUNCATE</command> on the referenced table,
      you should check to see if any foreign key violations exist.  The
      simplest way is to add a new instance of the foreign key constraint
      (and, once that succeeds, drop it or the original constraint).
      That may be prohibitive from a locking standpoint, however, in which
      case you might prefer to manually query for unmatched rows.

      Fix failure to attach foreign key constraints to sub-partitions
      (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)
     </para>

     <para>
      When adding a partition to a level below the first level of a
      multi-level partitioned table, foreign key constraints referencing
      the top partitioned table were not cloned to the new partition,
      leading to possible constraint violations later.  Detaching and
      re-attaching the new partition is the cheapest way to fix this.
      However, if there are many partitions to be fixed, adding a new
      instance of the foreign key constraint might be preferable.

      Avoid treating TID scans as sequential scans (Tatsuhito Kasahara)

     <para>
      A refactoring oversight caused TID scans (selection by CTID) to be
      counted as sequential scans in the statistics views, and to take
      whole-table predicate locks as sequential scans do.  The latter
      behavior could cause unnecessary serialization errors in
      serializable transaction mode.

      A self-referential view can't work; it will always result in

      Allow the planner to apply potentially-leaky tests to child-table
      statistics, if the user can read the corresponding column of the
      table that's actually named in the query (Dilip Kumar, Amit Langote)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change fixes a performance problem for partitioned tables that
      was created by the fix for CVE-2017-7484.  That security fix
      disallowed applying leaky operators to statistics for columns that
      the current user doesn't have permission to read directly.  However,
      it's somewhat common to grant permissions only on the parent
      partitioned table and not bother to do so on individual partitions.
      In such cases, the user can read the column via the parent, so
      there's no point in this security restriction; it only results in
      poorer planner estimates than necessary.

      Ensure that data types and collations used
      in <literal>XMLTABLE</literal> constructs are accounted for when
      computing dependencies of a view or rule (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously it was possible to break a view
      using <literal>XMLTABLE</literal> by dropping a type, if the type
      was not otherwise referenced in the view.  This fix does not
      correct the dependencies already recorded for existing views, only
      for newly-created ones.

      Transmit incoming <command>NOTIFY</command> messages to the client
      before sending <literal>ReadyForQuery</literal>, rather than after
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change ensures that, with libpq and other client libraries that
      act similarly to it, any notifications received during a transaction
      will be available by the time the client thinks the transaction is
      complete.  This probably makes no difference in practical
      applications (which would need to cope with asynchronous
      notifications in any case); but it makes it easier to build test
      cases with reproducible behavior.

      Fix bugs in handling of non-blocking I/O when using GSSAPI

     <para>
      These errors could result in dropping data (usually leading to

      sleep although not all its data has been sent.
      Moreover, <application>libpq</application> failed to keep separate
      encryption state for each connection, creating the possibility for
      failures in applications using multiple encrypted database
      connections.

      This makes the behavior similar to our SSL support, where it was

      Avoid logging complaints about abandoned connections when using PAM
      authentication (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      libpq-based clients will typically make two connection attempts when
      a password is required, since they don't prompt their user for a
      password until their first connection attempt fails.  Therefore the
      server is coded not to generate useless log spam when a client
      closes the connection upon being asked for a password.  However,
      the PAM authentication code hadn't gotten that memo, and would
      generate several messages about a phantom authentication failure.

      Fix misbehavior of <function>bitshiftright()</function> (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The bitstring right shift operator failed to zero out padding space
      that exists in the last byte of the result when the bitstring length
      is not a multiple of 8.  While invisible to most operations, any
      nonzero bits there would result in unexpected comparison behavior,
      since bitstring comparisons don't bother to ignore the extra bits,
      expecting them to always be zero.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you have inconsistent data as a result of saving the output
      of <function>bitshiftright()</function> in a table, it's possible to
      fix it with something like
<programlisting>
UPDATE mytab SET bitcol = ~(~bitcol) WHERE bitcol != ~(~bitcol);
</programlisting>

      Ensure correct code generation for spinlocks on PowerPC (Noah Misch)

     <para>
      The previous spinlock coding allowed the compiler to select register
      zero for use with an assembly instruction that does not accept that
      register, causing a build failure.  We have seen only one long-ago
      report that matches this bug, but it could cause problems for people
      trying to build modified <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> code
      or use atypical compiler options.

      zero or less.

     <para>
      The comparison operators for data type <type>name</type> can now use
      any collation, rather than always using <quote>C</quote> collation.
      To preserve the previous semantics of queries, columns of
      type <type>name</type> are now explicitly marked as
      having <quote>C</quote> collation.  A side effect of this is that
      regular-expression operators on <type>name</type> columns will now
      use the <quote>C</quote> collation by default, not the database
      collation, to determine the behavior of locale-dependent regular
      expression patterns (such as <literal>\w</literal>).  If you want
      non-C behavior for a regular expression on a <type>name</type>
      column, attach an explicit <literal>COLLATE</literal> clause.  (For
      user-defined <type>name</type> columns, another possibility is to
      specify a different collation at table creation time; but that just
      moves the non-backwards-compatibility to the comparison operators.)

      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Per the SQL standard, object-name columns in
      the <structname>information_schema</structname> views are declared
      as being of domain type <type>sql_identifier</type>.
      In <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, the underlying catalog
      columns are really of type <type>name</type>.  This change
      makes <type>sql_identifier</type> be a domain
      over <type>name</type>, rather than <type>varchar</type> as before.
      This eliminates a semantic mismatch in comparison and sorting
      behavior, which can greatly improve the performance of queries
      on <structname>information_schema</structname> views that restrict
      an object-name column.  Note however that inequality restrictions,
      for example
<programlisting>
SELECT ... FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name &lt; 'foo';
</programlisting>
      will now use <quote>C</quote>-locale comparison semantics by
      default, rather than the database's default collation as before.
      Sorting on these columns will also follow <quote>C</quote> ordering
      rules.  The previous behavior (and inefficiency) can be enforced by
      adding a <literal>COLLATE "default"</literal> clause.

      <para>
       Simplify renumbering manually-assigned OIDs, and establish a new
       project policy for management of such OIDs (John Naylor, Tom Lane)
      </para>

      <para>
       Patches that manually assign OIDs for new built-in objects (such as
       new functions) should now randomly choose OIDs in the range
       8000&mdash;9999.  At the end of a development cycle, the OIDs used
       by committed patches will be renumbered down to lower numbers,
       currently somewhere in the 4<replaceable>xxx</replaceable> range,
       using the new <link
       linkend="system-catalog-oid-assignment"><command>renumber_oids.pl</command></link>
       script.  This approach should greatly reduce the odds of OID
       collisions between different in-process patches.
      </para>

      <para>
       While there is no specific policy reserving any OIDs for external
       use, it is recommended that forks and other projects needing
       private manually-assigned OIDs use numbers in the high
       7<replaceable>xxx</replaceable> range.  This will avoid conflicts
       with recently-merged patches, and it should be a long time before
       the core project reaches that range.

      <para>
       While <literal>CHECK OPTION</literal>s on
       <application>postgres_fdw</application> tables are ignored (because
       the reference is foreign), views on such tables are considered
       local, so this change enforces <literal>CHECK OPTION</literal>s
       on them.  Previously, only <command>INSERT</command>s and
       <command>UPDATE</command>s with <literal>RETURNING</literal>
       clauses that returned <literal>CHECK OPTION</literal> values
       were validated.
