Let me guess at the problem. When you add a column, it doesn't change
all the records, therefore the column must be added at the end. This
means that the columns will not be in the same order as if you had
created them from scratch.

There seem to be three solutions:
a) Go to a much more sophisticated schema system, with versions and
version numbers (fairly hard but desirable to fix other schema change
problems). Then insert the column in the position it is supposed to be
in.

b) Fix the copy command to input and output the columns, not in the
order they are in, but in the order they would be in on re-creation.

c) make the copy command take arguments specifying the field names, like
INSERT can do.

I think it would be good if Postgres had all 3 features. Probably (b) is
the least work.

this is the problem:

Does the following indicate a bug? It sure is wierd. Maybe some of these
statements aren't supported by postgresql (??), but the outcome doesn't
make sense to me.

httpd=> CREATE TABLE x (y text);
CREATE
httpd=> CREATE VIEW z AS select * from x;
CREATE
httpd=> CREATE TABLE a (b text) INHERITS(z);
CREATE
httpd=> INSERT INTO x VALUES ('foo');
INSERT 168602 1
httpd=> select * from z*;
y  
---
foo
foo
(2 rows)

How did we suddenly get two rows??

With current sources:

regression=> CREATE TABLE x (y text);
CREATE
regression=> CREATE VIEW z AS select * from x;
CREATE
regression=> INSERT INTO x VALUES ('foo');
INSERT 411635 1
regression=> INSERT INTO z VALUES ('bar');
INSERT 411636 1
regression=> select * from x;
y
---
foo
(1 row)

regression=> select * from z;
y
---
foo
(1 row)

OK, where'd tuple 411636 go?  Seems to me that the insert should either
have been rejected or caused an insert into x, depending on how
transparent you think views are (I always thought they were
read-only?).  Dropping the data into never-never land and giving a
misleading success response code is not my idea of proper behavior.

Yup, that's about the size of it.  ADD COLUMN doesn't actually touch the
table itself, so it can only add a column that's initially all NULLs.
And even this depends on some uncomfortable assumptions about the
robustness of heap_getattr().  I have always wondered whether it works
if you ADD COLUMN a 33'rd column (or anything that is just past the
next padding boundary for the null-values bitmap).

Another problem with it is seen when you do a recursive ADD COLUMN in
an inheritance tree.  The added column has the first free column number
in each table, which generally means that it has different numbers in
the children than in the parent.  There are some kluges to make this
sort-of-work for simple cases, but a lot of stuff fails unpleasantly
--- Chris Bitmead can show you some scars from that, IIRC.

That's what I would like to see: all the children should have the
same column numbers for all columns that they inherit from the parent.

(Now, this would mean not only physically altering the tuples of
the children, but also renumbering their added columns, which has
implications on stored rules and triggers and so forth.  It'd be
painful, no doubt about it.  Still, I'd rather pay the price in the
seldom-used ADD COLUMN case than try to deal with out-of-sync column
numbers in many other, more commonly exercised, code paths.)

If we allow deleted column as a basic feature of postgres,
it could be like that 

base:    COL1 | COL2 | COL3 
child:   COL1 | COL2 | COL3 | COL4

after add column 5 to base table

base:    COL1 | COL2 | COL3 | del4 | COL5 
child:   COL1 | COL2 | COL3 | COL4 | COL5

after add column 6 to child

base:    COL1 | COL2 | COL3 | del4 | COL5 
child:   COL1 | COL2 | COL3 | COL4 | COL5 | COL6

after drop column 2 from base table

base:    COL1 | del2 | COL3 | del4 | COL5 
child:   COL1 | del2 | COL3 | COL4 | COL5 | COL6

dropping column from child table that is not a deleted column in 
parent is not allowed.

The delN columns are always NULLed on reading tuple and are written as proper 
null columns (taking up space only in NULL bitmask)

multiple inheritance is tricky and _requires_ unique column ids maybe oids
from pg_attribute to be doable.

This should be fixed in pg_dump by infering something via the oids of the
pg_attribute entries. No need to mess up the backend for it.

Maybe pg_dump should optionally dump schemas in terms of insert into
pg_something commands rather than actual DDL. ;)

I'm just trying to get the defaults and constraints working. If
inheritance stays broken the way it previously was, it's beyond my
powers. But I get the feeling that people rather not alter their tables
unless they have *perfect* alter table commands. I don't feel like arguing
with them, they'll just have to do without then.
