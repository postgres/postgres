  <title>SQL Syntax</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    A description of the general syntax of SQL.
   </para>
  </abstract>

  <para>
   <acronym>SQL</acronym> manipulates sets of data. The language is
   composed of various <firstterm>key words</firstterm>. Arithmetic
   and procedural expressions are allowed. We will cover these topics
   in this chapter; subsequent chapters will include details on data
   types, functions, and operators.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="sql-keywords">
   <title>Key Words</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> defines <firstterm>key words</firstterm> 
    for the language
    which have specific meaning. Some key words are
    <firstterm>reserved</firstterm>, which indicates that they are
    restricted to appear in only certain contexts. Other key words are
    <firstterm>not restricted</firstterm>, which indicates that in certain 
    contexts they
    have a specific meaning but are not otherwise constrained.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>Postgres</productname> implements an extended subset of the
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> languages. Some language
    elements are not as restricted in this implementation as is
    called for in the language standards, in part due
    to the extensibility features of <productname>Postgres</productname>. 
   </para>

   <para>
    Information on <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> key words

    <title>Reserved Key Words</title>

    <para>
     <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> have 
     <firstterm>reserved key words</firstterm> which are not allowed 
     as identifiers and not allowed in any usage other than as fundamental
     tokens in <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements.
     <productname>Postgres</productname> has additional key words
     which have similar restrictions. In particular, these key words
     are not allowed as column or table names, though in some cases
     they are allowed to be column labels (i.e. in AS clauses).
    </para>

    <tip>
     <para>
      Any string can be used as an identifier if surrounded by
      double quotes (<quote>like this!</quote>). Some care is required since
      such an identifier will be case sensitive
      and will retain embedded whitespace and most other special characters.
     </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
     The following are <productname>Postgres</productname>
     reserved words which are neither <acronym>SQL92</acronym>

  <sect1 id="sql-comments">
   <title>Comments</title>

   <para>
    A <firstterm>comment</firstterm>
    is an arbitrary sequence of characters beginning with double dashes
    and extending to the end of the line, e.g.:

    <programlisting>
-- This is a standard SQL comment
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    We also support C-style block comments, e.g.:

    <programlisting>
/* multi-line comment
 * with nesting: /* nested block comment */
 */
    </programlisting>

    where the comment begins with "<literal>/*</literal>" and extends
    to the matching occurrence of "<literal>*/</literal>". These block
    comments nest, as specified in SQL99, so that one can comment out
    larger blocks of code which may contain existing block comments.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sql-names">
   <title>Names</title>

   <para>
    Names in SQL must begin with a letter
    (<literal>a</literal>-<literal>z</literal>) or underscore
    (<literal>_</literal>).
    Subsequent characters in a name can be letters, digits
    (<literal>0</literal>-<literal>9</literal>),
    or underscores.  The system uses no more than NAMEDATALEN-1 characters
    of a name; longer names can be written in queries, but they will be
    truncated.
    By default, NAMEDATALEN is 32 so the maximum name length is 31 (but
    at the time the system is built, NAMEDATALEN can be changed in
    <filename>src/include/postgres_ext.h</filename>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Names containing other characters may be formed by surrounding them
    with double quotes (<literal>"</literal>).  For example, table or column
    names may contain
    otherwise disallowed characters such as spaces, ampersands, etc. if
    quoted.  Quoting a name also makes it case-sensitive,
    whereas unquoted names are always folded to lower case.  For example,
    the names <literal>FOO</literal>, <literal>foo</literal>
    and <literal>"foo"</literal> are
    considered the same by <productname>Postgres</productname>, but
    <literal>"Foo"</literal> is a different name.
   </para>

   <para>
    Double quotes can also be used to protect a name that would otherwise
    be taken to be an SQL keyword.  For example, <literal>IN</literal>
    is a keyword but <literal>"IN"</literal> is a name.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sql-constants">
   <title>Constants</title>

   <para>
    There are three kinds of <firstterm>implicitly typed constants</firstterm>
    in <productname>Postgres</productname>: strings, integers, 
    and floating point numbers.  Constants can
    also be specified with explicit types, which can enable more
    accurate representation and more efficient handling by the
    backend. The implicit constants are described below; explicit
    constants are discussed afterwards.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>String Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Strings</firstterm>
     in SQL are arbitrary sequences of ASCII characters bounded by single
     quotes ("'", e.g. <literal>'This is a string'</literal>).
     SQL92 allows single quotes to be embedded in strings by typing two 
     adjacent single quotes (e.g. <literal>'Dianne''s horse'</literal>).
     In <productname>Postgres</productname> single quotes may alternatively
     be escaped with a backslash ("\", e.g.
     <literal>'Dianne\'s horse'</literal>).  To include a
     backslash in a string constant, type two backslashes.
     Non-printing characters may also be embedded within strings by
     prepending them with a backslash
     (e.g. <literal>'\<replaceable>tab</replaceable>'</literal>).
    </para>

   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Integer Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Integer constants</firstterm>
     in SQL are sequences of ASCII digits with no decimal point.
     The range of legal values depends on which integer datatype is
     used, but the plain <literal>integer</literal> type accepts values
     ranging from -2147483648 to +2147483647.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Floating Point Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Floating point constants</firstterm>
     consist of an integer part, a decimal point, and a fraction part or
     scientific notation of the following format:

     <synopsis>
{<replaceable>dig</replaceable>}.{<replaceable>dig</replaceable>} [e [+-] {<replaceable>dig</replaceable>}]
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>dig</replaceable> is one or more digits.
     You must include at least one <replaceable>dig</replaceable> after the
     period and after the [+-] if you use those options.  An exponent with
     a missing mantissa has a mantissa of 1 inserted.  There may be no
     extra characters embedded in the string.
    </para>

    <para>
     Floating point constaints are of type
     <type>float8</type>. <type>float4</type> can be specified
     explicitly by using <acronym>SQL92</acronym> string notation or
     <productname>Postgres</productname> type notation:

     <programlisting>
float4 '1.23'  -- string style
'1.23'::float4 -- Postgres (historical) style
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Constants of Postgres User-Defined Types</title>

    <para>
     A constant of an
     <emphasis>arbitrary</emphasis>
     type can be entered using any one of the following notations:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>type</replaceable> '<replaceable>string</replaceable>'
'<replaceable>string</replaceable>'::<replaceable>type</replaceable>
CAST ( '<replaceable>string</replaceable>' AS <replaceable>type</replaceable> )
     </synopsis>

     The value inside the string is passed to the input
     conversion routine for the type called
     <replaceable>type</replaceable>. The result is a
     constant of the indicated type.  The explicit typecast may be omitted
     if there is no ambiguity as to the type the constant must be, in which
     case it is automatically coerced.
    </para>

    <para>
     It is also possible to specify a type coercion using a function-like
     syntax:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>typename</replaceable> ( <replaceable>value</replaceable> )
     </synopsis>

     although this only works for types whose names are also valid as
     function names.  (For example, <literal>double precision</literal>
     can't be used this way --- but the equivalent <literal>float8</literal>
     can.)
    </para>

    <para>
     The <literal>::</literal>, <literal>CAST()</literal>, and function-call
     syntaxes can also be used to specify run-time type conversions.  But
     the form <replaceable>type</replaceable>
     '<replaceable>string</replaceable>' can only be used to specify the
     type of a literal constant.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Array constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Array constants</firstterm>
     are n-dimensional arrays of any Postgres datatype.
     The general format of an array constant is the following:

     <synopsis>
{ <replaceable>val1</replaceable> <replaceable>delim</replaceable> <replaceable>val2</replaceable> <replaceable>delim</replaceable> ... }
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>delim</replaceable>
     is the delimiter character for the type, as recorded in its
     <literal>pg_type</literal> class entry.
     (For all built-in types, this is the comma character ",".)
     Each <replaceable>val</replaceable> is either a constant
     of the array element type, or a sub-array.
     An example of an array constant is

     <programlisting>
{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
     </programlisting>

     This constant is a two-dimensional, 3 by 3 array consisting of three
     sub-arrays of integers.
    </para>

    <para>
     Individual array elements can be placed between single-quote
     marks to avoid ambiguity problems with respect to leading white space.
     Without quote marks, the array-value parser will skip white space.
     Note that to write a quote mark inside a string literal that is to
     become an array value, you must double the quote mark as described
     previously.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sql-columns">
   <title>Fields and Columns</title>

   <sect2>
    <title>Fields</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>field</firstterm>
     is either a user-defined attribute of a given class or one of the
     following system-defined attributes:

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>oid</term>

   <sect2>
    <title>Columns</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>column</firstterm> is a construct of the form:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>instance</replaceable>{.<replaceable>composite_field</replaceable>}.<replaceable>field</replaceable> `['<replaceable>subscript</replaceable>`]'
     </synopsis>

     <replaceable>instance</replaceable>
     identifies a particular class and can be thought of as standing for
     the instances of that class.  An instance variable is either a class
     name, an alias for a class defined by means of a FROM clause,
     or the keyword NEW or OLD.
     (NEW and OLD can only appear in the action portion of a rule, while
     other instance variables can be used in any SQL statement.)  The
     instance name can be omitted if the first field name is unique
     across all the classes being used in the current query.
     <replaceable>composite_field</replaceable>
     is a field of of one of the Postgres composite types,
     while successive composite fields select attributes in the
     class(s) to which the composite field evaluates.  Lastly,
     <replaceable>field</replaceable>
     is a normal (base type) field in the class(s) last addressed.  If
     <replaceable>field</replaceable>
     is of an array type,
     then the optional <replaceable>subscript</replaceable>
     selects a specific element in the array.  If no subscript is
     provided, then the whole array is selected.

   <title>Operators</title>

   <para>
    Any built-in or user-defined operator may be used in SQL.
    For the list of built-in operators consult <xref linkend="functions">.
    For a list of user-defined operators consult your system administrator
    or run a query on the <literal>pg_operator</literal> class.
    Parentheses may be used for arbitrary grouping of operators in expressions.

   <title>Expressions</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> allows <firstterm>expressions</firstterm>
    to transform data in tables. Expressions may contain operators
    and functions.
   </para>

   <para>
    An expression is one of the following:

    <title>Parameters</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>parameter</firstterm>
     is used to indicate a parameter in a SQL function.  Typically this

$<replaceable class="parameter">number</replaceable>
     </synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     For example, consider the definition of a function,

    <title>Functional Expressions</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>functional expression</firstterm>
     is the name of a legal SQL function, followed by its argument list
     enclosed in parentheses:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>function</replaceable> (<replaceable>expression</replaceable> [, <replaceable>expression</replaceable> ... ] )
     </synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     For example, the following computes the square root of an employee
     salary:

     <programlisting>
sqrt(emp.salary)
     </programlisting>
    </para>

   <sect2 id="syntax-aggregates">
    <title>Aggregate Expressions</title>

    <para>
     An <firstterm>aggregate expression</firstterm> represents the application
     of an aggregate function across the rows selected by a query.
     An aggregate function reduces multiple inputs to a single output value,
     such as the sum or average of the inputs.
     The syntax of an aggregate expression is one of the following:

    <simplelist>
     <member><replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> (<replaceable>expression</replaceable>)</member>
     <member><replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> (ALL <replaceable>expression</replaceable>)</member>
     <member><replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> (DISTINCT <replaceable>expression</replaceable>)</member>
     <member><replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> ( * )</member>
    </simplelist>

     where <replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> is a previously defined
     aggregate, and <replaceable>expression</replaceable> is any expression
     that doesn't itself contain an aggregate expression.
    </para>

    <para>
     The first form of aggregate expression invokes the aggregate across all
     input rows for which the given expression yields a non-null value.
     The second form is the same as the first, since ALL is the default.
     The third form invokes the aggregate for all distinct non-null values
     of the expression found in the input rows.  The last form invokes the
     aggregate once for each input row regardless of null or non-null values;
     since no particular input value is specified, it is generally only useful
     for the count() aggregate.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, count(*) yields the total number of input rows;
      count(f1) yields the number of input rows in which f1 is non-null;
      count(distinct f1) yields the number of distinct non-null values of f1.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Target List</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>target list</firstterm>
     is a comma-separated list of one or more elements, each
     of which must be of the form:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>expression</replaceable> [ AS <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable> ]
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable>
     is the name to be assigned to the created column.  If 
     <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable>
     is not present, then <productname>Postgres</productname> selects a
     default name based on the contents of <replaceable>expression</replaceable>.
     If <replaceable>expression</replaceable> is a simple attribute reference
     then the default name will be the same as that attribute's name, but
     otherwise the implementation is free to assign any default name.
    </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Qualification</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>qualification</firstterm>
     consists of any number of clauses connected by the logical operators:

     <simplelist>
      <member>NOT</member>
      <member>AND</member>
      <member>OR</member>
     </simplelist>

     A clause is an <replaceable>expression</replaceable>
     that evaluates to a <literal>boolean</literal> over a set of instances.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>From List</title>

    <para>
     The <firstterm>from list</firstterm>
     is a comma-separated list of <firstterm>from-expressions</firstterm>.
     The simplest possibility for a from-expression is:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>class_reference</replaceable> [ [ AS ] <replaceable class="PARAMETER">alias</replaceable> ]
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>class_reference</replaceable> is of the form

     <synopsis>
[ ONLY ] <replaceable class="PARAMETER">table_name</replaceable> [ * ]
     </synopsis>

     The from-expression defines an instance variable that ranges over the
     rows of the specified table.  The instance variable's name is either
     the table name, or the <replaceable>alias</replaceable> if one is given.
     Ordinarily, if the table has child tables then the instance variable
     will range over all rows in the inheritance hierarchy starting with
     the specified table.  If <literal>ONLY</literal> is specified then
     child tables are not included.  A trailing asterisk <literal>*</literal>
     can be written to specifically indicate that child tables are included
     (<literal>ONLY</literal> and <literal>*</literal> are mutually
     exclusive).
    </para>

    <para>
     A from-expression can also be a sub-query:

     <synopsis>
( <replaceable class="PARAMETER">select-statement</replaceable> ) [ AS ] <replaceable class="PARAMETER">alias</replaceable>
     </synopsis>

     Here, the effect is as though the SELECT were executed and its results
     stored in a temporary table, which then becomes available as an instance
     variable under the given <replaceable>alias</replaceable>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Finally, a from-expression can be built up from simpler from-expressions
     using JOIN clauses:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable class="PARAMETER">from_expression</replaceable> [ NATURAL ] <replaceable class="PARAMETER">join_type</replaceable> <replaceable class="PARAMETER">from_expression</replaceable>
    [ ON <replaceable class="PARAMETER">join_condition</replaceable> | USING ( <replaceable class="PARAMETER">join_column_list</replaceable> ) ]
     </synopsis>

     This syntax allows specification of <firstterm>outer joins</firstterm>.
     For details see the reference page for SELECT.

  <sect2 id="sql-precedence">
   <title>Lexical Precedence</title>

   <para>
    The precedence and associativity of the operators is hard-wired
    into the parser.  Most operators have the same precedence and are
    left-associative.  This may lead to non-intuitive behavior; for
    example the boolean operators "&lt;" and "&gt;" have a different
    precedence than the boolean operators "&lt;=" and "&gt;=".  Also,
    you will sometimes need to add parentheses when using combinations
    of binary and unary operators.  For instance
<programlisting>
SELECT 5 &amp; ~ 6;
</programlisting>
   will be parsed as
<programlisting>
SELECT (5 &amp;) ~ 6;
</programlisting>
    because the parser has no idea that <token>&amp;</token> is
    defined as a binary operator.  This is the price one pays for
    extensibility.

    Note that the operator precedence rules also apply to user-defined
    operators that have the same names as the built-in operators
    mentioned above.  For example, if you define a
    <quote>+</quote> operator for some custom data type it will have
    the same precedence as the built-in <quote>+</quote> operator, no
    matter what yours does.
