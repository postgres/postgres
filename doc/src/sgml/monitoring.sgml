<chapter id="monitoring">
 <title>Monitoring Database Activity</title>

 <para>
  A database administrator frequently wonders, <quote>What is the system
  doing right now?</quote>
  This chapter discusses how to find that out.
 </para>

  <para>
   Several tools are available for monitoring database activity and
   analyzing performance.  Most of this chapter is devoted to describing
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <firstterm>statistics collector</>,
   but one should not neglect regular Unix monitoring programs such as
   <command>ps</> and <command>top</>.  Also, once one has identified a
   poorly-performing query, further investigation may be needed using
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <command>EXPLAIN</> command.
   The &cite-user; discusses <command>EXPLAIN</>
   and other methods for understanding the behavior of an individual
   query.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="monitoring-ps">
  <title>Standard Unix Tools</Title>

  <indexterm zone="monitoring-ps">
   <primary>ps</primary>
   <secondary>to monitor activity</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   On most platforms, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> modifies its
   command title as reported by <command>ps</>, so that individual server
   processes can readily be identified.  A sample display is

<screen>
$ ps auxww | grep ^postgres
postgres   960  0.0  1.1  6104 1480 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postmaster -i
postgres   963  0.0  1.1  7084 1472 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postgres: stats buffer process   
postgres   965  0.0  1.1  6152 1512 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postgres: stats collector process   
postgres   998  0.0  2.3  6532 2992 pts/1    SN   13:18   0:00 postgres: tgl runbug 127.0.0.1 idle
postgres  1003  0.0  2.4  6532 3128 pts/1    SN   13:19   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] SELECT waiting
postgres  1016  0.1  2.4  6532 3080 pts/1    SN   13:19   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] idle in transaction
</screen>

   (The appropriate invocation of <command>ps</> varies across different
   platforms, as do the details of what is shown.  This example is from a
   recent Linux system.)  The first process listed here is the
   <firstterm>postmaster</>, the master server process.  The command arguments
   shown for it are the same ones given when it was launched.  The next two
   processes implement the statistics collector, which will be described in
   detail in the next section.  (These will not be present if you have set
   the system not to start the statistics collector.)  Each of the remaining
   processes is a server process handling one client connection.  Each such
   process sets its command line display in the form

<screen>
postgres: <replaceable>user</> <replaceable>database</> <replaceable>host</> <replaceable>activity</>
</screen>

  The user, database, and connection source host items remain the same for
  the life of the client connection, but the activity indicator changes.
  The activity may be <literal>idle</> (i.e., waiting for a client command),
  <literal>idle in transaction</> (waiting for client inside a <command>BEGIN</> block),
  or a command type name such as <literal>SELECT</>.  Also,
  <literal>waiting</> is attached if the server is presently waiting
  on a lock held by another server process.  In the above example we can infer
  that process 1003 is waiting for process 1016 to complete its transaction and
  thereby release some lock or other.
  </para>

  <tip>
  <para>
  <productname>Solaris</productname> requires special handling. You must
  use <command>/usr/ucb/ps</command>, rather than
  <command>/bin/ps</command>. You also must use two <command>w</command>
  flags, not just one. In addition, your original invocation of the
  <application>postmaster</application> must have a shorter
  <command>ps</command> status display than that provided by each
  backend.   If you fail to do all three things, the <command>ps</>
  output for each backend will be the original <application>postmaster</>
  command line.

 <sect1 id="monitoring-stats">
  <title>Statistics Collector</Title>

  <indexterm zone="monitoring-stats">
   <primary>statistics</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <firstterm>statistics collector</>
   is a subsystem that supports collection and reporting of information about
   server activity.  Presently, the collector can count accesses to tables
   and indexes in both disk-block and individual-row terms.  It also supports
   determining the exact query currently being executed by other server
   processes.
  </para>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-setup">
  <title>Statistics Collection Configuration</Title>

  <para>
   Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution,
   the system can be configured to collect or not collect information.
   This is controlled by configuration variables that are normally set in
   <filename>postgresql.conf</> (see <xref linkend="runtime-config"> for
   details about setting configuration variables).
  </para>

  <para>
   The variable <varname>STATS_START_COLLECTOR</varname> must be set to
   <literal>true</> for the statistics collector to
   be launched at all.  This is the default and recommended setting,
   but it may be turned off if you have no interest in statistics and
   want to squeeze out every last drop of overhead.  (The savings is
   likely to be small, however.)  Note that this option
   cannot be changed while the server is running.
  </para>

  <para>
   The variables <varname>STATS_COMMAND_STRING</varname>,
   <varname>STATS_BLOCK_LEVEL</varname>,
   and <varname>STATS_ROW_LEVEL</varname> control how much information is
   actually sent to the collector, and thus determine how much run-time
   overhead occurs.  These respectively determine whether a server process
   sends its current command string, disk-block-level access statistics, and
   row-level access statistics to the collector.  Normally these variables are
   set in <filename>postgresql.conf</> so that they apply to all server
   processes, but it is possible to turn them on or off in individual server
   processes using the <command>SET</> command.  (To prevent ordinary users
   from hiding their activity from the administrator, only superusers are
   allowed to change these variables with <command>SET</>.)
  </para>

   <important>
    <para>
     Since the variables <varname>STATS_COMMAND_STRING</varname>,
     <varname>STATS_BLOCK_LEVEL</varname>, and
     <varname>STATS_ROW_LEVEL</varname> default to <literal>false</>,
     very few statistics are collected in the default
     configuration. Enabling one or more of these configuration
     variables will significantly enhance the amount of useful data
     produced by the statistics collector, at the expense of
     additional run-time overhead.
    </para>
   </important>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-views">
  <title>Viewing Collected Statistics</Title>

  <para>
   Several predefined views are available to show the results of
   statistics collection, listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-views-table">.  Alternatively, one can
   build custom views using the underlying statistics functions.
  </para>

  <para>
   When using the statistics to monitor current activity, it is important
   to realize that the information does not update instantaneously.
   Each individual server process transmits new access counts to the collector
   just before waiting for another client command; so a query still in
   progress does not affect the displayed totals.  Also, the collector itself
   emits new totals at most once per <varname>pgstat_stat_interval</varname> milliseconds
   (500 by default).  So the displayed totals lag behind actual activity.
  </para>

  <para>
   Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display
   any of these statistics, it first fetches the most recent totals emitted by
   the collector process.  It then continues to use this snapshot for all
   statistical views and functions until the end of its current transaction.
   So the statistics will appear not to change as long as you continue the
   current transaction.
   This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform several
   queries on the statistics and correlate the results without worrying that
   the numbers are changing underneath you.  But if you want to see new
   results with each query, be sure to do the queries outside any transaction
   block.

  <para>
   The per-index statistics are particularly useful to determine which
   indexes are being used and how effective they are.
  </para>

  <para>
   The <structname>pg_statio_</> views are primarily useful to
   determine the effectiveness of the buffer cache.  When the number
   of actual disk reads is much smaller than the number of buffer
   hits, then the cache is satisfying most read requests without
   invoking a kernel call. However, these statistics do not give the
   entire story: due to the way in which <productname>PostgreSQL</>
   handles disk I/O, data that is not in the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> buffer cache may still reside in the
   kernel's I/O cache, and may therefore still be fetched without
   requiring a physical read. Users interested in obtaining more
   detailed information on <productname>PostgreSQL</> I/O behavior are
   advised to use the <productname>PostgreSQL</> statistics collector
   in combination with operating system utilities that allow insight
   into the kernel's handling of I/O.
  </para>

  <para>
   Other ways of looking at the statistics can be set up by writing
   queries that use the same underlying statistics access functions as
   these standard views do.  These functions are listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-funcs-table">.  The per-database access
   functions accept a database OID to identify which database to
   report on.  The per-table and per-index functions accept a table or
   index OID (note that only tables and indexes in the current
   database can be seen with these functions).  The per-backend access
   functions accept a backend ID number, which ranges from one to the
   number of currently active backends.

  <note>
   <para>
    When the <literal>pg_locks</literal> view is accessed, the
    internal lock manager data structures are momentarily locked, and
    a copy is made for the view to display.  This ensures that the
    view produces a consistent set of results, while not blocking
    normal lock manager operations longer than necessary.  Nonetheless
    there could be some impact on database performance if this view is
    examined often.

  <para>
   <xref linkend="monitoring-locks-table"> shows the definition of the
   <literal>pg_locks</literal> columns.  The
   <literal>pg_locks</literal> view contains one row per lockable
   object and requested lock mode.  Thus, the same lockable object may
   appear many times, if multiple transactions are holding or waiting
   for locks on it.  A lockable object is either a relation or a
   transaction ID.  (Note that this view includes only table-level
   locks, not row-level ones.  If a transaction is waiting for a
   row-level lock, it will appear in the view as waiting for the
   transaction ID of the current holder of that row lock.)

       The OID of the locked relation, or null if the lockable object
       is a transaction ID. This column can be joined with the
       <literal>pg_class</literal> system catalog to get more
       information on the locked relation.  Note however that this
       will only work for relations in the current database (those for
       which the <structfield>database</structfield> column is either
       the current database's OID or zero).

       The OID of the database in which the locked relation exists, or

       is on a globally-shared table, this field will be zero. This

       The ID of a transaction, or null if the lockable object is a
       relation.  Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its
       transaction ID for its entire duration.  If one transaction
       finds it necessary to wait specifically for another
       transaction, it does so by attempting to acquire share lock on
       the other transaction ID.  That will succeed only when the
       other transaction terminates and releases its locks.

      <entry>
       True if this lock has been granted (is held by this session).
       False indicates that this session is currently waiting to
       acquire this lock, which implies that some other session is
       holding a conflicting lock mode on the same lockable object.
       This backend will sleep until the other lock is released (or a
       deadlock situation is detected). A single backend can be
       waiting to acquire at most one lock at a time.
