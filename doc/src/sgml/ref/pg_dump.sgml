   Description
  </title>

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</application> is a utility for backing up a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database. It makes consistent
   backups even if the database is being used concurrently.
   <application>pg_dump</application> does not block other users
   accessing the database (readers or writers).
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</application> only dumps a single database.  To backup
   global objects that are common to all databases in a cluster, such as roles
   and tablespaces, use <xref linkend="app-pg-dumpall">.
  </para>

  <para>
   Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script
   dumps are plain-text files containing the SQL commands required
   to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was
   saved. To restore from such a script, feed it to <xref
   linkend="app-psql">. Script files
   can be used to reconstruct the database even on other machines and
   other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL
   database products.
  </para>

  <para>
   The alternative archive file formats must be used with
   <xref linkend="app-pgrestore"> to rebuild the database.  They
   allow <application>pg_restore</application> to be selective about
   what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being
   restored.
   The archive file formats are designed to be portable across
   architectures.
  </para>

  <para>
   When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
   <application>pg_restore</application>,
   <application>pg_dump</application> provides a flexible archival and
   transfer mechanism. <application>pg_dump</application> can be used to
   backup an entire database, then <application>pg_restore</application>
   can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the
   database are to be restored. The most flexible output file formats are
   the <quote>custom</quote> format (<option>-Fc</option>) and the
   <quote>directory</quote> format(<option>-Fd</option>). They allow
   for selection and reordering of all archived items, support parallel
   restoration, and are compressed by default. The <quote>directory</quote>
   format is the only format that supports parallel dumps.
  </para>

  <para>
   While running <application>pg_dump</application>, one should examine the
   output for any warnings (printed on standard error), especially in
   light of the limitations listed below.
  </para>

           Output a custom-format archive suitable for input into
           <application>pg_restore</application>.
           Together with the directory output format, this is the most flexible
           output format in that it allows manual selection and reordering of
           archived items during restore. This format is also compressed by
           default.

          <para>
           Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into
           <application>pg_restore</application>. This will create a directory
           with one file for each table and blob being dumped, plus a
           so-called Table of Contents file describing the dumped objects in a
           machine-readable format that <application>pg_restore</application>
           can read. A directory format archive can be manipulated with
           standard Unix tools; for example, files in an uncompressed archive
           can be compressed with the <application>gzip</application> tool.
           This format is compressed by default and also supports parallel
           dumps.

          <para>
           Output a <command>tar</command>-format archive suitable for input
           into <application>pg_restore</application>. The tar format is
           compatible with the directory format: extracting a tar-format
           archive produces a valid directory-format archive.
           However, the tar format does not support compression. Also, when
           using tar format the relative order of table data items cannot be
           changed during restore.

        Run the dump in parallel by dumping <replaceable class="parameter">njobs</replaceable>
        tables simultaneously. This option reduces the time of the dump but it also
        increases the load on the database server. You can only use this option with the
        directory output format because this is the only output format where multiple processes
        can write their data at the same time.
       </para>
       <para><application>pg_dump</> will open <replaceable class="parameter">njobs</replaceable>

        setting is high enough to accommodate all connections.
       </para>
       <para>
        Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could
        cause the dump to fail. The reason is that the <application>pg_dump</> master process
        requests shared locks on the objects that the worker processes are going to dump later
        in order to
        make sure that nobody deletes them and makes them go away while the dump is running.
        If another client then requests an exclusive lock on a table, that lock will not be
        granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the master process to be
        released. Consequently any other access to the table will not be granted either and
        will queue after the exclusive lock request. This includes the worker process trying
        to dump the table. Without any precautions this would be a classic deadlock situation.
        To detect this conflict, the <application>pg_dump</> worker process requests another
        shared lock using the <literal>NOWAIT</> option. If the worker process is not granted
        this shared lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in the meantime
        and there is no way to continue with the dump, so <application>pg_dump</> has no choice
        but to abort the dump.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a consistent backup, the database server needs to support synchronized snapshots,
        a feature that was introduced in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.2. With this
        feature, database clients can ensure they see the same data set even though they use
        different connections. <command>pg_dump -j</command> uses multiple database
        connections; it connects to the database once with the master process and
        once again for each worker job. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the
        different worker jobs wouldn't be guaranteed to see the same data in each connection,
        which could lead to an inconsistent backup.
       </para>
       <para>
        If you want to run a parallel dump of a pre-9.2 server, you need to make sure that the
        database content doesn't change from between the time the master connects to the
        database until the last worker job has connected to the database. The easiest way to
        do this is to halt any data modifying processes (DDL and DML) accessing the database
        before starting the backup. You also need to specify the
        <option>--no-synchronized-snapshots</option> parameter when running
        <command>pg_dump -j</command> against a pre-9.2 <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
        server.

       <para>
        Dump only schemas matching <replaceable
        class="parameter">schema</replaceable>; this selects both the
        schema itself, and all its contained objects.  When this option is
        not specified, all non-system schemas in the target database will be
        dumped.  Multiple schemas can be
        selected by writing multiple <option>-n</> switches.  Also, the
        <replaceable class="parameter">schema</replaceable> parameter is
        interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
        <application>psql</>'s <literal>\d</> commands (see <xref
        linkend="APP-PSQL-patterns" endterm="APP-PSQL-patterns-title">),
        so multiple schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters
        in the pattern.  When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern
        if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcards;  see
        <xref linkend="pg-dump-examples" endterm="pg-dump-examples-title">.

       <note>
        <para>
         When <option>-n</> is specified, <application>pg_dump</application>
         makes no attempt to dump any other database objects that the selected
         schema(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee
         that the results of a specific-schema dump can be successfully
         restored by themselves into a clean database.

         compatible with pre-8.2 <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
         versions.  Formerly, writing <literal>-t tab</> would dump all
         tables named <literal>tab</>, but now it just dumps whichever one
         is visible in your default search path.  To get the old behavior
         you can write <literal>-t '*.tab'</>.  Also, you must write something
         like <literal>-t sch.tab</> to select a table in a particular schema,
         rather than the old locution of <literal>-n sch -t tab</>.

        major version is different from <application>pg_dump</>'s, or when
        the output is intended to be loaded into a server of a different

        identifiers that are reserved words in its own major version.
        This sometimes results in compatibility issues when dealing with
        servers of other versions that may have slightly different sets
        of reserved words.  Using <option>--quote-all-identifiers</> prevents

       <para>
        Use a <literal>serializable</literal> transaction for the dump, to
        ensure that the snapshot used is consistent with later database
        states; but do this by waiting for a point in the transaction stream
        at which no anomalies can be present, so that there isn't a risk of
        the dump failing or causing other transactions to roll back with a
        <literal>serialization_failure</literal>.  See <xref linkend="mvcc">
        for more information about transaction isolation and concurrency
        control.
       </para>

       <para>
        This option is not beneficial for a dump which is intended only for
        disaster recovery.  It could be useful for a dump used to load a
        copy of the database for reporting or other read-only load sharing
        while the original database continues to be updated.  Without it the
        dump may reflect a state which is not consistent with any serial
        execution of the transactions eventually committed.  For example, if
        batch processing techniques are used, a batch may show as closed in
        the dump without all of the items which are in the batch appearing.
       </para>

       <para>
        This option will make no difference if there are no read-write
        transactions active when pg_dump is started.  If read-write
        transactions are active, the start of the dump may be delayed for an
        indeterminate length of time.  Once running, performance with or
        without the switch is the same.

  <para>
   <application>pg_dump</application> internally executes
   <command>SELECT</command> statements. If you have problems running
   <application>pg_dump</application>, make sure you are able to
   select information from the database using, for example, <xref
   linkend="app-psql">.  Also, any default connection settings and environment
   variables used by the <application>libpq</application> front-end
   library will apply.
  </para>

  <para>
   The database activity of <application>pg_dump</application> is
   normally collected by the statistics collector.  If this is
   undesirable, you can set parameter <varname>track_counts</>
   to false via <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> or the <literal>ALTER
   USER</literal> command.

  <para>
   If your database cluster has any local additions to the <literal>template1</> database,
   be careful to restore the output of <application>pg_dump</application> into a
   truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to
   duplicate definitions of the added objects.  To make an empty database
   without any local additions, copy from <literal>template0</> not <literal>template1</>,
   for example:
<programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   When a data-only dump is chosen and the option <option>--disable-triggers</>
   is used, <application>pg_dump</application> emits commands
   to disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data,
   and then commands to re-enable them after the data has been
   inserted.  If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system
   catalogs might be left in the wrong state.
  </para>

  <para>
   The dump file produced by <application>pg_dump</application>
   does not contain the statistics used by the optimizer to make
   query planning decisions.  Therefore, it is wise to run
   <command>ANALYZE</command> after restoring from a dump file
   to ensure optimal performance; see <xref linkend="vacuum-for-statistics">
   and <xref linkend="autovacuum"> for more information.
   The dump file also does not
   contain any <command>ALTER DATABASE ... SET</> commands;
   these settings are dumped by <xref linkend="app-pg-dumpall">,
   along with database users and other installation-wide settings.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because <application>pg_dump</application> is used to transfer data
   to newer versions of <productname>PostgreSQL</>, the output of
   <application>pg_dump</application> can be expected to load into
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> server versions newer than
   <application>pg_dump</>'s version.  <application>pg_dump</> can also
   dump from <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers older than its own version.
   (Currently, servers back to version 7.0 are supported.)
   However, <application>pg_dump</> cannot dump from
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers newer than its own major version;
   it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump.
   Also, it is not guaranteed that <application>pg_dump</>'s output can
   be loaded into a server of an older major version &mdash; not even if the
   dump was taken from a server of that version.  Loading a dump file
   into an older server may require manual editing of the dump file
   to remove syntax not understood by the older server.
   Use of the <option>--quote-all-identifiers</option> option is recommended
   in cross-version cases, as it can prevent problems arising from varying
   reserved-word lists in different <productname>PostgreSQL</> versions.

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>

  </para>

  <para>
   To reload such a script into a (freshly created) database named
   <literal>newdb</>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>psql -d newdb -f db.sql</userinput>

  <para>
   To dump a database into a directory-format archive:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -Fd mydb -f dumpdir</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a database into a directory-format archive in parallel with
   5 worker jobs:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -Fd mydb -j 5 -f dumpdir</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To reload an archive file into a (freshly created) database named
   <literal>newdb</>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_restore -d newdb db.dump</userinput>

  </para>

  <para>
   To dump a single table named <literal>mytab</>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t mytab mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all tables whose names start with <literal>emp</> in the
   <literal>detroit</> schema, except for the table named
   <literal>employee_log</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t 'detroit.emp*' -T detroit.employee_log mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all schemas whose names start with <literal>east</> or
   <literal>west</> and end in <literal>gsm</>, excluding any schemas whose
   names contain the word <literal>test</>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -n 'east*gsm' -n 'west*gsm' -N '*test*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   The same, using regular expression notation to consolidate the switches:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -n '(east|west)*gsm' -N '*test*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To dump all database objects except for tables whose names begin with
   <literal>ts_</literal>:

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -T 'ts_*' mydb &gt; db.sql</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   To specify an upper-case or mixed-case name in <option>-t</> and related
   switches, you need to double-quote the name; else it will be folded to
   lower case (see <xref
   linkend="APP-PSQL-patterns" endterm="APP-PSQL-patterns-title">).  But
   double quotes are special to the shell, so in turn they must be quoted.
   Thus, to dump a single table with a mixed-case name, you need something
   like

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pg_dump -t "\"MixedCaseName\"" mydb &gt; mytab.sql</userinput>
</screen></para>
