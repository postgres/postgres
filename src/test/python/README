A test suite for exercising both the libpq client and the server backend at the
protocol level, based on pytest and Construct.

The test suite currently assumes that the standard PG* environment variables
point to the database under test and are sufficient to log in a superuser on
that system. In other words, a bare `psql` needs to Just Work before the test
suite can do its thing. For a newly built dev cluster, typically all that I need
to do is a

    export PGDATABASE=postgres

but you can adjust as needed for your setup.

## Requirements

A supported version (3.6+) of Python.

The first run of

    make installcheck

will install a local virtual environment and all needed dependencies. During
development, if libpq changes incompatibly, you can issue

    $ make rebuild-psycopg2

to force a rebuild of the client library.

## Hacking

The code style is enforced by a _very_ opinionated autoformatter. Running the

    make indent

recipe will invoke it for you automatically. Don't fight the tool; part of the
zen is in knowing that if the formatter makes your code ugly, there's probably a
cleaner way to write your code.

## Advanced Usage

The Makefile is there for convenience, but you don't have to use it. Activate
the virtualenv to be able to use pytest directly:

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ py.test -k oauth
    ...
    $ py.test ./server/test_server.py
    ...
    $ deactivate  # puts the PATH et al back the way it was before

To make quick smoke tests possible, slow tests have been marked explicitly. You
can skip them by saying e.g.

    $ py.test -m 'not slow'
