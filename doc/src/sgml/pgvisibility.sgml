 <para>
  The <filename>pg_visibility</> module provides a means for examining the
  visibility map (VM) and page-level visibility information of a table.
  It also provides functions to check the integrity of a visibility map and to
  force it to be rebuilt.
 </para>

 <para>
  Three different bits are used to store information about page-level
  visibility.  The all-visible bit in the visibility map indicates that every
  tuple in the corresponding page of the relation is visible to every current
  and future transaction.  The all-frozen bit in the visibility map indicates
  that every tuple in the page is frozen; that is, no future vacuum will need
  to modify the page until such time as a tuple is inserted, updated, deleted,
  or locked on that page.
  The page header's <literal>PD_ALL_VISIBLE</literal> bit has the
  same meaning as the all-visible bit in the visibility map, but is stored
  within the data page itself rather than in a separate data structure.
  These two bits will normally agree, but the page's all-visible bit can
  sometimes be set while the visibility map bit is clear after a crash
  recovery.  The reported values can also disagree because of a change that
  occurs after <literal>pg_visibility</> examines the visibility map and
  before it examines the data page.  Any event that causes data corruption
  can also cause these bits to disagree.
 </para>

 <para>
  Functions that display information about <literal>PD_ALL_VISIBLE</> bits
  are much more costly than those that only consult the visibility map,
  because they must read the relation's data blocks rather than only the
  (much smaller) visibility map.  Functions that check the relation's
  data blocks are similarly expensive.

     <para>
      Returns the TIDs of non-frozen tuples stored in pages marked all-frozen
      in the visibility map.  If this function returns a non-empty set of
      TIDs, the visibility map is corrupt.

      Returns the TIDs of non-all-visible tuples stored in pages marked

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Truncates the visibility map for the given relation.  This function is
      useful if you believe that the visibility map for the relation is
      corrupt and wish to force rebuilding it.  The first <command>VACUUM</>
      executed on the given relation after this function is executed will scan
      every page in the relation and rebuild the visibility map.  (Until that
      is done, queries will treat the visibility map as containing all zeroes.)

  <para>
   By default, these functions are executable only by superusers and members of the
   <literal>pg_stat_scan_tables</literal> role, with the exception of
   <function>pg_truncate_visibility_map(relation regclass)</function> which can only
   be executed by superusers.
