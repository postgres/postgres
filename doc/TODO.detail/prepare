    Right.  A real improvement would only be to have the prepared
    execution plan in the backend and just giving  the  parameter
    values.

    I can think of the following construct:

        PREPARE optimizable-statement;

    That one will run parser/rewrite/planner, create a new memory
    context with a unique identifier and  saves  the  querytree's
    and  plan's  in  it.   Parameter values are identified by the
    usual $n notation. The command returns the identifier.

        EXECUTE QUERY identifier [value [, ...]];

    then get's back the prepared plan and querytree  by  the  id,
    creates  an  executor  context  with  the given values in the
    parameter array and calls ExecutorRun() for them.

    The PREPARE needs to analyze the resulting parsetrees to  get
    the  datatypes  (and maybe atttypmod's) of the parameters, so
    EXECUTE QUERY can convert the values into Datum's  using  the
    types  input  functions.  And  the  EXECUTE has to be handled
    special in tcop (it's something between a regular  query  and
    an utility statement). But it's not too hard to implement.

    Finally a

        FORGET QUERY identifier;

    (don't  remember  how  the  others  named it) will remove the
    prepared plan etc. simply by destroying  the  memory  context
    and dropping the identifier from the id->mcontext+prepareinfo
    mapping.

    This all  restricts  the  usage  of  PREPARE  to  optimizable
    statements.  Is  it  required  to  be able to prepare utility
    statements (like CREATE TABLE or so) too?

 It's probably a little about me :-) ... well,

  My query cache is in usable state and it's efficient for all 
things those motivate me to work on this.

 some basic features:

	- share parsed plans between backends in shared memory
	- store plans to private backend hash table
	- use parameters for stored queries
	- better design for SPI 
			- memory usage for saved plans
			- save plans "by key"

 
 The current query cache code depend on 7.1 memory management. After
official 7.1 release I prepare patch with query cache+SPI (if not
hit me over head, please ..)

 All what will doing next time not depend on me, *it's on code developers*.

 For example Jan has interesting idea about caching all plans which
processing backend. But it's far future and IMHO we must go by small
steps to Oracle's funeral :-) 

 If I need the query cache in the my work (typical for some web+pgsql) or 
will some public interest I will continue on this, if not I freeze it. 
(Exists more interesting work like http://mape.jcu.cz ... sorry of 
advertising :-)

 Please, read my old query cache and PREPARE/EXECUTE description...

 We have in PG parameters, see SPI, but now it's used inside backend only
and not exist statement that allows to use this feature in be<->fe.

        PREPARE <name> AS <query>
                [ USING type, ... typeN ]
                [ NOSHARE | SHARE | GLOBAL ]

        EXECUTE <name>
                [ INTO [ TEMPORARY | TEMP ] [ TABLE ] new_table ]

                       [ NOSHARE | SHARE | GLOBAL ]

        DEALLOCATE PREPARE
                [ <name> [ NOSHARE | SHARE | GLOBAL ]]
                [ ALL | ALL INTERNAL ]


An example:


PREPARE chris_query AS SELECT * FROM pg_class WHERE relname = $1 USING text;

EXECUTE chris_query USING 'pg_shadow';

 This not depend on query cache. The '$n' is PostgreSQL query parametr
keyword and is defined in standard parser. The PREPARE statement not parsing
query it's job for standard parser.

The postgresql executor expect types of parametrs in separate input (array).
I not sure how much expensive/executable is survey it from query.

By the way, PREPARE/EXECUTE is face only. More interesting in this period is
query-cache-kernel. SQL92 is really a little unlike my PREPARE/EXECUTE.
