The PostgreSQL contrib tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subtree contains tools, modules, and examples that are not
maintained as part of the core PostgreSQL system, mainly because
they only address a limited audience or are too inelegant to be
sold as an official feature.  That, however, does not preclude
their usefulness.

Each subdirectory contains a README file with information about the
module.  Most items can be built with `gmake all' and installed
with `gmake install' in the usual fashion, after you have run the
`configure' script in the top-level directory.  Some directories
supply new user-defined functions, operators, or types.  After you
have installed the files you need to register the new entities in
the database system by running the commands in the supplied .sql
file.  For example,

	$ psql -d dbname -f module.sql

See the PostgreSQL documentation for more information about this
procedure.
