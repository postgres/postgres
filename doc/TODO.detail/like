You can even make it fully compliant if you want. (There are of course
backward compatibility problems. I'm not sure what the Postgres policy is
on this.)

- If the escape character is backslash, do nothing.
- Otherwise, turn all backslashes in the string to double backslashes.
- If the escape character is not set, stop here.
- Turn all occurences of the escape character into a backslash except
  where the escape character is doubled, where it should be made into a
  single occurence.
(Optionally, if "\n" is just an 'n' character, you can handle double
occurences of the escape character by turning the first one into a
backslash.)

Probably the best bet for PostgreSQL programmers is to always code Like
clauses with an ESCAPE '\' (or however its written).

I really wish they'd chosen a character other than underscore for the
"match one" wildcard... Is there any standard practice for seperating words
in table names?
