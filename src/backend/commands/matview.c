 * refresh_by_match_merge
 *
 * Refresh a materialized view with transactional semantics, while allowing
 * concurrent reads.
 *
 * This is called after a new version of the data has been created in a
 * temporary table.  It performs a full outer join against the old version of
 * the data, producing "diff" results.  This join cannot work if there are any
 * duplicated rows in either the old or new versions, in the sense that every
 * column would compare as equal between the two rows.  It does work correctly
 * in the face of rows which have at least one NULL value, with all non-NULL
 * columns equal.  The behavior of NULLs on equality tests and on UNIQUE
 * indexes turns out to be quite convenient here; the tests we need to make
 * are consistent with default behavior.  If there is at least one UNIQUE
 * index on the materialized view, we have exactly the guarantee we need.
 *
 * The temporary table used to hold the diff results contains just the TID of
 * the old record (if matched) and the ROW from the new table as a single
 * column of complex record type (if matched).
 *
 * Once we have the diff table, we perform set-based DELETE and INSERT
 * operations against the materialized view, and discard both temporary
 * tables.
 *
 * Everything from the generation of the new data to applying the differences
 * takes place under cover of an ExclusiveLock, since it seems as though we
 * would want to prohibit not only concurrent REFRESH operations, but also
 * incremental maintenance.  It also doesn't seem reasonable or safe to allow
 * SELECT FOR UPDATE or SELECT FOR SHARE on rows being updated or deleted by
