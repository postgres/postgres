  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   <application>libpq</application> is the <acronym>C</acronym>
   application programmer's interface to
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  <application>libpq</application> is a set
   of library routines that allow client programs to pass queries to the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> backend server and to receive the
   results of these queries.  <application>libpq</application> is also the
   underlying engine for several other <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   application interfaces, including <application>libpq++</application> (C++),
   <filename>libpgtcl</filename> (Tcl), <productname>Perl</productname>, and
   <filename>ecpg</filename>.  So some aspects of <application>libpq</>'s behavior will be
   important to you if you use one of those packages.
  </para>

  <para>
   Three short programs are included at the end of this section to show how
   to write programs that use <filename>libpq</filename>.  There are several
   complete examples of <filename>libpq</filename> applications in the
   following directories:

   <simplelist>
    <member><filename>src/test/examples</filename></member>
    <member><filename>src/bin/psql</filename></member>
   </simplelist>
  </para>

  <para>
   Frontend programs that use <filename>libpq</filename> must include the
   header file <filename>libpq-fe.h</filename> and must link with the
   <filename>libpq</filename> library.
  </para>

  <title>Database Connection Functions</title>

  <para>
   The following routines deal with making a connection to a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> backend server.  The
   application program can have several backend connections open at
   one time.  (One reason to do that is to access more than one
   database.)  Each connection is represented by a
   <structname>PGconn</> object which is obtained from
   <function>PQconnectdb</> or <function>PQsetdbLogin</>.  Note that
   these functions will always return a non-null object pointer,
   unless perhaps there is too little memory even to allocate the
   <structname>PGconn</> object.  The <function>PQstatus</> function
   should be called to check whether a connection was successfully
   made before queries are sent via the connection object.

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <function>PQconnectdb</function> 
       Makes a new connection to the database server.
       <synopsis>
PGconn *PQconnectdb(const char *conninfo)
       </synopsis>

   This routine opens a new database connection using the parameters taken
   from the string <literal>conninfo</literal>.  Unlike <function>PQsetdbLogin</> below,
   the parameter set can be extended without changing the function signature,
   so use either of this routine or the nonblocking analogues <function>PQconnectStart</>
   and <function>PQconnectPoll</function> is preferred for application programming.  The passed string
   can be empty to use all default parameters, or it can contain one or more
   parameter settings separated by whitespace.
   </para>

   <para>
   Each parameter setting is in the form <literal>keyword = value</literal>.
   (To write an empty value or a value containing
   spaces, surround it with single quotes, e.g.,
   <literal>keyword = 'a value'</literal>.
   Single quotes and backslashes within the value must be escaped with a
   backslash, e.g., <literal>\'</literal> or <literal>\\</literal>.)
   Spaces around the equal sign are optional.  The currently recognized
   parameter keywords are:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>host</literal></term>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      Name of host to connect to. 
      If this begins with a slash, it specifies Unix-domain communication
      rather than TCP/IP communication; the value is the name of the
      directory in which the socket file is stored.
      The default is to connect to a Unix-domain socket in
      <filename>/tmp</filename>.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>hostaddr</literal></term>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      IP address of host to connect to. This should be in standard
      IPv4 address format, e.g. <literal>172.28.40.9</>.  If your machine 
      supports IPv6, you can also use those addresses. If a nonzero-length 
      string is specified, TCP/IP communication is used.
     </para>
     <para>
      Using <literal>hostaddr</> instead of host allows the application to avoid a host
      name look-up, which may be important in applications with time
      constraints. However, Kerberos authentication requires the host
      name. The following therefore applies: If host is specified without
      <literal>hostaddr</>, a host name lookup is forced. If <literal>hostaddr</> is specified without
      host, the value for <literal>hostaddr</> gives the remote address; if Kerberos is
      used, this causes a reverse name query. If both host and <literal>hostaddr</> are
      specified, the value for <literal>hostaddr</> gives the remote address; the value
      for host is ignored, unless Kerberos is used, in which case that value
      is used for Kerberos authentication. Note that authentication is likely
      to fail if <application>libpq</application> is passed a host name that is not the name of the
      machine at <literal>hostaddr</>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Without either a host name or host address, <application>libpq</application> will connect using a
      local Unix domain socket.

     <para>
      Service name to use for additional parameters.  It specifies a service
      name in pg_service.conf that holds additional connection parameters.
      This allows applications to specify only a service name so connection parameters 
      can be centrally maintained.  See <literal>pg_service.conf.sample</> for
      information on how to set up the file.

   If  any  parameter is unspecified, then the corresponding

   then hardwired defaults are used.
   The return value is a pointer to an abstract <type>struct</type>
   representing the connection to the backend.

   These two routines are used to open a connection to a database server such
   that your application's thread of execution is not blocked on remote I/O
   whilst doing so.
  </para>
  <para>
   The database connection is made using the parameters taken from the string
   <literal>conninfo</literal>, passed to <function>PQconnectStart</function>. This string is in
   the same format as described above for <function>PQconnectdb</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Neither <function>PQconnectStart</function> nor <function>PQconnectPoll</function> will block, as long as a number of
   restrictions are met:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The <literal>hostaddr</> and <literal>host</> parameters are used appropriately to ensure that
      name and reverse name queries are not made. See the documentation of
      these parameters under <function>PQconnectdb</function> above for details.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you call <function>PQtrace</function>, ensure that the stream object into which you trace
      will not block.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You ensure for yourself that the socket is in the appropriate state
      before calling <function>PQconnectPoll</function>, as described below.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   To begin, call <literal>conn=PQconnectStart("<replaceable>connection_info_string</>")</literal>.
   If <varname>conn</varname> is NULL, then <application>libpq</> has been unable to allocate a new <structname>PGconn</>
   structure. Otherwise, a valid <structname>PGconn</> pointer is returned (though not yet
   representing a valid connection to the database). On return from
   <function>PQconnectStart</function>, call <literal>status=PQstatus(conn)</literal>. If status equals
   <symbol>CONNECTION_BAD</symbol>, <function>PQconnectStart</function> has failed.
  </para>
  <para>
   If <function>PQconnectStart</> succeeds, the next stage is to poll <application>libpq</> so that it may
   proceed with the connection sequence.  Loop thus: Consider a connection
   <quote>inactive</quote> by default. If <function>PQconnectPoll</function> last returned <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_ACTIVE</>,
   consider it <quote>active</quote> instead. If <function>PQconnectPoll(conn)</function> last returned
   <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_READING</symbol>, perform a <function>select()</> for reading on <function>PQsocket(conn)</function>. If
   it last returned <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_WRITING</symbol>, perform a <function>select()</> for writing on
   <function>PQsocket(conn)</function>. If you have yet to call <function>PQconnectPoll</function>, i.e. after the call
   to <function>PQconnectStart</function>, behave as if it last returned <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_WRITING</symbol>.  If
   the <function>select()</> shows that the socket is ready, consider it <quote>active</quote>. If it has
   been decided that this connection is <quote>active</quote>, call <function>PQconnectPoll(conn)</function>
   again. If this call returns <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_FAILED</symbol>, the connection procedure
   has failed.  If this call returns <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_OK</symbol>, the connection has been
   successfully made.
  </para>

  <para>
    Note that the use of <function>select()</function> to ensure that the socket is ready is merely
    a (likely) example; those with other facilities available, such as a
    <function>poll()</function> call, may of course use that instead.
  </para>

  <para>
    At any time during connection, the status of the connection may be
    checked, by calling <function>PQstatus</>. If this is <symbol>CONNECTION_BAD</>, then the
    connection procedure has failed; if this is <function>CONNECTION_OK</>, then the
    connection is ready.  Either of these states should be equally detectable
    from the return value of <function>PQconnectPoll</>, as above. Other states may be
    shown during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These
    indicate the current stage of the connection procedure, and may be useful
    to provide feedback to the user for example. These statuses may include:

      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain
    compatibility), an application should never rely upon these appearing in a
    particular order, or at all, or on the status always being one of these
    documented values. An application may do something like this:
<programlisting>
switch(PQstatus(conn))
{
    case CONNECTION_STARTED:
        feedback = "Connecting...";
        break;

    case CONNECTION_MADE:
        feedback = "Connected to server...";
        break;
.
.
.
    default:
        feedback = "Connecting...";
}
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Note that if <function>PQconnectStart</function> returns a non-NULL pointer, you must call
   <function>PQfinish</function> when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of
   the structure and any associated memory blocks. This must be done even if a
   call to <function>PQconnectStart</function> or <function>PQconnectPoll</function> failed.
  </para>

  <para>
   <function>PQconnectPoll</function> will currently block if
   <application>libpq</> is compiled with <symbol>USE_SSL</symbol>
   defined. This restriction may be removed in the future.
  </para>

  <para>
   These functions leave the socket in a nonblocking state as if 
   <function>PQsetnonblocking</function> had been called.

</synopsis>
   Returns a connection options array.  This may
   be used to determine all possible <function>PQconnectdb</function> options and their
   current default values.  The return value points to an array of
   <structname>PQconninfoOption</structname> <type>struct</>s, which ends with an entry having a NULL
   keyword pointer.  Note that the default values (<structfield>val</structfield> fields)
   will depend on environment variables and other context.
   Callers must treat the connection options data as read-only.
   </para>

   <para>
    After processing the options array, free it by passing it to
    <function>PQconninfoFree</function>.  If this is not done, a small amount of memory
    is leaked for each call to <function>PQconndefaults</function>.
   </para>

   <para>
    In <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> versions before 7.0, <function>PQconndefaults</function> returned a pointer
    to a static array, rather than a dynamically allocated array.  That

      <para>
       The status can be one of a number of values.
       However, only two of these are
       seen outside of an asynchronous connection procedure -
       <literal>CONNECTION_OK</literal> or
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal>. A good
       connection to the database has the status <literal>CONNECTION_OK</literal>.
       A failed connection
       attempt is signaled by status
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal>.
       Ordinarily, an OK status will remain so until
       <function>PQfinish</function>, but a
       communications failure might result in the status changing to
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal> prematurely.
       In that case the application
       could try to recover by calling <function>PQreset</function>.

If you want to include strings that have been received

<function>PQescapeString</> performs this operation.  The
<parameter>from</> points to the first character of the string that
is to be escaped, and the <parameter>length</> parameter counts the
number of characters in this string (a terminating zero byte is
neither necessary nor counted).  <parameter>to</> shall point to a
buffer that is able to hold at least one more character than twice
the value of <parameter>length</>, otherwise the behavior is
undefined.  A call to <function>PQescapeString</> writes an escaped
version of the <parameter>from</> string to the <parameter>to</>
buffer, replacing special characters so that they cannot cause any
harm, and adding a terminating zero byte.  The single quotes that
must surround <productname>PostgreSQL</> string literals are not part of the result

<para>
Using <function>PQsendQuery</function> and <function>PQgetResult</function>
solves one of <function>PQexec</function>'s problems:
If a command string contains multiple <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands, the results of those
commands can be obtained individually.  (This allows a simple form of
overlapped processing, by the way: the frontend can be handling the
results of one query while the backend is still working on later
queries in the same command string.)  However, calling <function>PQgetResult</function> will
still cause the frontend to block until the backend completes the
next <acronym>SQL</acronym> command.  This can be avoided by proper use of three more
functions:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQconsumeInput</function>
	  If input is available from the backend, consume it.
<synopsis>
int PQconsumeInput(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> normally returns 1 indicating <quote>no error</quote>,
but returns 0 if there was some kind of trouble (in which case
<function>PQerrorMessage</function> is set).  Note that the result does not say
whether any input data was actually collected. After calling
<function>PQconsumeInput</function>, the application may check
<function>PQisBusy</function> and/or <function>PQnotifies</function> to see if
their state has changed.
</para>
<para>
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> may be called even if the application is not
prepared to deal with a result or notification just yet.  The
routine will read available data and save it in a buffer, thereby
causing a <function>select()</function> read-ready indication to go away.  The
application can thus use <function>PQconsumeInput</function> to clear the
<function>select()</function> condition immediately, and then examine the results at leisure.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQisBusy</function>
Returns 1 if a query is busy, that is, <function>PQgetResult</function> would block
waiting for input.  A 0 return indicates that <function>PQgetResult</function> can
be called with assurance of not blocking.
<synopsis>
int PQisBusy(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
<function>PQisBusy</function> will not itself attempt to read data from the backend;
therefore <function>PQconsumeInput</function> must be invoked first, or the busy
state will never end.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQflush</function> Attempt to flush any data queued to the backend,
returns 0 if successful (or if the send queue is empty) or <symbol>EOF</symbol> if it failed for
some reason.
<synopsis>
int PQflush(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
<function>PQflush</function> needs to be called on a nonblocking connection 
before calling <function>select()</function> to determine if a response has
arrived.  If 0 is returned it ensures that there is no data queued to the 
backend that has not actually been sent.  Only applications that have used
<function>PQsetnonblocking</function> have a need for this.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQsocket</function>
	  Obtain the file descriptor number for the backend connection socket.

	  no backend connection is currently open.
<synopsis>
int PQsocket(const PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
<function>PQsocket</function> should be used to obtain the backend socket descriptor
in preparation for executing <function>select()</function>.  This allows an
application using a blocking connection to wait for either backend responses or
other conditions.
If the result of <function>select()</function> indicates that data can be read from
the backend socket, then <function>PQconsumeInput</function> should be called to read the
data; after which, <function>PQisBusy</function>, <function>PQgetResult</function>,
and/or <function>PQnotifies</function> can be used to process the response.
</para>
<para>
Nonblocking connections (that have used <function>PQsetnonblocking</function>)
should not use <function>select()</function> until <function>PQflush</function>
has returned 0 indicating that there is no buffered data waiting to be sent
to the backend.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
A typical frontend using these functions will have a main loop that uses
<function>select</function> to wait for all the conditions that it must
respond to.  One of the conditions will be input available from the backend,
which in <function>select</function>'s terms is readable data on the file
descriptor identified by <function>PQsocket</function>.
When the main loop detects input ready, it should call
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> to read the input.  It can then call
<function>PQisBusy</function>, followed by <function>PQgetResult</function>
if <function>PQisBusy</function> returns false (0).  It can also call
<function>PQnotifies</function> to detect NOTIFY messages (see <xref linkend="libpq-notify">).
</para>

<para>
A frontend that uses <function>PQsendQuery</function>/<function>PQgetResult</function>
can also attempt to cancel a command that is still being processed by the backend.
</para>

<function>PQrequestCancel</function>
	  Request that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> abandon
	  processing of the current command.
<synopsis>
int PQrequestCancel(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
The return value is 1 if the cancel request was successfully
dispatched, 0 if not.  (If not, <function>PQerrorMessage</function> tells why not.)
Successful dispatch is no guarantee that the request will have any
effect, however.  Regardless of the return value of <function>PQrequestCancel</function>,
the application must continue with the normal result-reading
sequence using <function>PQgetResult</function>.  If the cancellation
is effective, the current command will terminate early and return
an error result.  If the cancellation fails (say, because the
backend was already done processing the command), then there will
be no visible result at all.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Note that if the current command is part of a transaction, cancellation
will abort the whole transaction.
</para>

<para>
<function>PQrequestCancel</function> can safely be invoked from a signal handler.
So, it is also possible to use it in conjunction with plain
<function>PQexec</function>, if the decision to cancel can be made in a signal
handler.  For example, <application>psql</application> invokes
<function>PQrequestCancel</function> from a <systemitem>SIGINT</> signal handler, thus allowing
interactive cancellation of queries that it issues through <function>PQexec</function>.
Note that <function>PQrequestCancel</function> will have no effect if the connection
is not currently open or the backend is not currently processing a command.

<title>Asynchronous Notification</title>

  <indexterm zone="libpq-notify"><primary>NOTIFY</primary></indexterm>

<para>
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports asynchronous notification via the
<command>LISTEN</command> and <command>NOTIFY</command> commands.  A backend registers its interest in a particular
notification condition with the <command>LISTEN</command> command (and can stop listening
with the <command>UNLISTEN</command> command).  All backends listening on a
particular condition will be notified asynchronously when a <command>NOTIFY</command> of that
condition name is executed by any backend.  No additional information is
passed from the notifier to the listener.  Thus, typically, any actual data
that needs to be communicated is transferred through a database relation.
Commonly the condition name is the same as the associated relation, but it is
not necessary for there to be any associated relation.
</para>

<para>
<filename>libpq</filename> applications submit <command>LISTEN</command> and <command>UNLISTEN</command>
commands as ordinary SQL command.  Subsequently, arrival of <command>NOTIFY</command>
messages can be detected by calling <function>PQnotifies</function>.

<function>PQnotifies</function>
          Returns  the next notification from a list of unhandled
          notification messages received from the backend.  Returns NULL if
          there are no pending notifications.  Once a notification is
	  returned from <function>PQnotifies</>, it is considered handled and will be
	  removed from the list of notifications.

</para>

<para>
<function>PQnotifies()</function> does not actually read backend data; it just
returns messages previously absorbed by another <application>libpq</application>
function.  In prior releases of <application>libpq</application>, the only way
to ensure timely receipt of NOTIFY messages was to constantly submit queries,
even empty ones, and then check <function>PQnotifies()</function> after each
<function>PQexec()</function>.  While this still works, it is
deprecated as a waste of processing power.
</para>
<para>
A better way to check for NOTIFY
messages when you have no useful queries to make is to call
<function>PQconsumeInput()</function>, then check
<function>PQnotifies()</function>.
You can use <function>select()</function> to wait for backend data to
arrive, thereby using no <acronym>CPU</acronym> power unless there is something
to do.  (See <function>PQsocket()</function> to obtain the file descriptor
number to use with <function>select()</function>.)
Note that this will work OK whether you submit queries with
<function>PQsendQuery</function>/<function>PQgetResult</function> or simply
use <function>PQexec</function>.  You should, however, remember to
check <function>PQnotifies()</function> after each
<function>PQgetResult</function> or <function>PQexec</function>, to see
if any notifications came in during the processing of the query.

Like <function>fgets</function>,  this  routine copies up to length-1 characters

the terminating newline into a zero byte.
<function>PQgetline</function> returns <symbol>EOF</symbol> at the end of input, 0 if the

Notice that the application must check to see if a

which  indicates  that the backend server has finished sending
the results  of  the  copy  command.
If  the  application might
receive lines that are more than length-1  characters  long,

This routine is similar to <function>PQgetline</function>, but it can be used
by applications
that must read COPY data asynchronously, that is without blocking.
Having issued the COPY command and gotten a <literal>PGRES_COPY_OUT</literal>
response, the
application should call <function>PQconsumeInput</function> and
<function>PQgetlineAsync</function> until the
end-of-data signal is detected.  Unlike <function>PQgetline</function>, this routine takes
responsibility for detecting end-of-data.
On each call, <function>PQgetlineAsync</function> will return data if a complete newline-
terminated data line is available in <application>libpq</>'s input buffer, or if the
incoming data line is too long to fit in the buffer offered by the caller.
Otherwise, no data is returned until the rest of the line arrives.
</para>
<para>
The routine returns -1 if the end-of-copy-data marker has been recognized,
or 0 if no data is available, or a positive number giving the number of
bytes of data returned.  If -1 is returned, the caller must next call
<function>PQendcopy</function>, and then return to normal processing.
The data returned will not extend beyond a newline character.  If possible
a whole line will be returned at one time.  But if the buffer offered by
the caller is too small to hold a line sent by the backend, then a partial
data line will be returned.  This can be detected by testing whether the
last returned byte is <literal>\n</literal> or not.
The returned string is not null-terminated.  (If you want to add a
terminating null, be sure to pass a <parameter>bufsize</parameter> one smaller than the room
actually available.)

</para>

<para>
When using <function>PQgetResult</function>, the application should respond to
a <literal>PGRES_COPY_OUT</literal> result by executing <function>PQgetline</function>
repeatedly, followed by <function>PQendcopy</function> after the terminator line is seen.
It should then return to the <function>PQgetResult</function> loop until
<function>PQgetResult</function> returns NULL. Similarly a <literal>PGRES_COPY_IN</literal>
result is processed by a series of <function>PQputline</function> calls followed by
<function>PQendcopy</function>, then return to the <function>PQgetResult</function> loop.
This arrangement will ensure that
a copy in or copy out command embedded in a series of <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands
will be executed correctly.
</para>
<para>
Older applications are likely to submit a copy in or copy out
via <function>PQexec</function> and assume that the transaction is done after
<function>PQendcopy</function>.
This will work correctly only if the copy in/out is the only
<acronym>SQL</acronym> command in the command string.

creation of a new <structname>PGconn</> object.
</para>

<para>
The return value is the pointer to the previous notice processor.
If you supply a callback function pointer of NULL, no action is taken,
but the current pointer is returned.
</para>

<para>
Once you have set a notice processor, you should expect that that function
could be called as long as either the <structname>PGconn</> object or <structname>PGresult</> objects
made from it exist.  At creation of a <structname>PGresult</>, the <structname>PGconn</>'s current
notice processor pointer is copied into the <structname>PGresult</> for possible use by
routines like <function>PQgetvalue</function>.

The <filename>.pgpass</filename> file in a user's home directory is a
file that can contain passwords to be used if the connection requires
a password. This file should have the format:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>hostname</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable>:<replaceable>database</replaceable>:<replaceable>username</replaceable>:<replaceable>password</replaceable>
</synopsis>
Any of these may be a literal name, or <literal>*</literal>, which matches

Entries with <literal>:</literal> or <literal>\</literal> should be escaped
with <literal>\</literal>.
</para>
<para>
The permissions on <filename>.pgpass</filename> must disallow any
access to world or group; achieve this by the command
<command>chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass</command>.

</indexterm>

<para>
<filename>libpq</filename> is thread-safe as of
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.0, so long as no two threads
attempt to manipulate the same <structname>PGconn</> object at the same
time. In particular, you cannot issue concurrent queries from different
threads through the same connection object. (If you need to run
concurrent queries, start up multiple connections.)
</para>

<para>
<structname>PGresult</> objects are read-only after creation, and so can be passed around
freely between threads.
</para>

<para>
The deprecated functions <function>PQoidStatus</function> and
<function>fe_setauthsvc</function> are not thread-safe and should not be
used in multithread programs.  <function>PQoidStatus</function> can be
replaced by <function>PQoidValue</function>.  There is no good reason to
call <function>fe_setauthsvc</function> at all.
</para>

<para>
<filename>Libpq</filename> clients using the <literal>crypt</literal>
encryption method rely on the <literal>crypt()</literal> operating
system function, which is often not thread-safe. It is better to use
<literal>MD5</literal> encryption, which is thread-safe on all
platforms.

 <sect1 id="libpq-build">
  <title>Building <application>Libpq</application> Programs</title>

  <para>
   To build (i.e., compile and link) your <application>libpq</application> programs you need to
   do all of the following things:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Include the <filename>libpq-fe.h</filename> header file:
<programlisting>
#include &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;
</programlisting>
      If you failed to do that then you will normally get error
      messages from your compiler similar to
<screen>
foo.c: In function `main':
foo.c:34: `PGconn' undeclared (first use in this function)
foo.c:35: `PGresult' undeclared (first use in this function)
foo.c:54: `CONNECTION_BAD' undeclared (first use in this function)
foo.c:68: `PGRES_COMMAND_OK' undeclared (first use in this function)
foo.c:95: `PGRES_TUPLES_OK' undeclared (first use in this function)
</screen>
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Point your compiler to the directory where the <productname>PostgreSQL</> header
      files were installed, by supplying the
      <literal>-I<replaceable>directory</replaceable></literal> option
      to your compiler.  (In some cases the compiler will look into
      the directory in question by default, so you can omit this
      option.)  For instance, your compile command line could look
      like:
<programlisting>
cc -c -I/usr/local/pgsql/include testprog.c
</programlisting>
      If you are using makefiles then add the option to the
      <varname>CPPFLAGS</varname> variable:
<programlisting>
CPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/pgsql/include
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm><primary>pg_config</></>
      If there is any chance that your program might be compiled by
      other users then you should not hardcode the directory location
      like that.  Instead, you can run the utility
      <command>pg_config</command> to find out where the header files
      are on the local system:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> pg_config --includedir
<computeroutput>/usr/local/include</computeroutput>
</screen>
     </para>

     <para>
      Failure to specify the correct option to the compiler will
      result in an error message such as
<screen>
testlibpq.c:8:22: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory
</screen>
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      When linking the final program, specify the option
      <literal>-lpq</literal> so that the <application>libpq</application> library gets pulled
      in, as well as the option
      <literal>-L<replaceable>directory</replaceable></literal> to
      point it to the directory where the <application>libpq</application> library resides.  (Again, the
      compiler will search some directories by default.)  For maximum
      portability, put the <option>-L</option> option before the
      <option>-lpq</option> option.  For example:
<programlisting>
cc -o testprog testprog1.o testprog2.o -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lpq
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      You can find out the library directory using
      <command>pg_config</command> as well:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> pg_config --libdir
<computeroutput>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</computeroutput>
</screen>
     </para>

     <para>
      Error messages that point to problems in this area could look
      like the following.
<screen>
testlibpq.o: In function `main':
testlibpq.o(.text+0x60): undefined reference to `PQsetdbLogin'
testlibpq.o(.text+0x71): undefined reference to `PQstatus'
testlibpq.o(.text+0xa4): undefined reference to `PQerrorMessage'
</screen>
      This means you forgot <option>-lpq</option>.
<screen>
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpq
</screen>
      This means you forgot the <option>-L</option> or did not specify
      the right path.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>libpq-int.h</></>
   If your codes references the header file
   <filename>libpq-int.h</filename> and you refuse to fix your code to
   not use it, starting in <productname>PostgreSQL</> 7.2, this file will be found in
   <filename><replaceable>includedir</replaceable>/postgresql/internal/libpq-int.h</filename>,
   so you need to add the appropriate <option>-I</option> option to
   your compiler command line.
