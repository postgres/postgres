My 2 cents, or 2 ören since I'm a Swede, on this:

It is pretty simple to build a replication with pg_dump, transfer,
empty replic and reload.
But if we want "live replicas" we better base our efforts on a
mechanism using WAL-logs to rollforward the replicas.

Interesting idea.  I can see how this might sync up two databases
somehow.  For true replication, however, I would always want every
replicated database to be, at the very least, internally consistent
(i.e., referential integrity), even if it was a little behind on
processing transactions.  In this method, its not clear how
consistency is every achieved/guaranteed at any point in time if the
input stream of changes is continuous.  If the input stream ceased,
then I can see how this approach might eventually catch up and totally
resync everything, but it looks *very* computationally  expensive.

But I might have missed something.  How would internal consistency be
maintained?

My two cents is that, while I can see this kind of database syncing as
valuable, this is not the kind of "replication" I had in mind.  This
may already possible by simply copying the database.  What replication
means to me is a live, continuously streaming sequence of updates from
one database to another where the replicated database is always
internally consistent, available for read-only queries, and never "too
far" out of sync with the source/primary database.

What does replication mean to others?

Cheers,
Ed Loehr

    What's the typical unit of work for the database?  Are we talking about
update transactions which span the entire DB?  Or are we talking about
updating maybe 1% or less of the database everyday?  I'd think it would be
more towards the latter than the former.  So, yes, this process would be
computationally expensive but how many records would actually have to be
sent back and forth?

    Updates that occur at site A will be moved to site B and vice versa.
Consistency would be maintained.  The only problem that I can see right off
the bat would be what if site A and site B made changes to a row and then
site C was brought into the picture?  Which one wins?

    Someone *has* to win when it comes to this type of thing.  You really
DON'T want to start merging row changes...

    Sounds like you're talking about distributed transactions to me.  That's
an entirely different subject all-together.  What you describe can be done
by copying a database...but as you say, this would only work in a read-only
situation.

	I too have been thinking about this some over the last year or
two, just trying to find a quick and easy way to do it. I am not so
interested in replication, as in synchronization, as in between a desktop
machine and a laptop, so I can keep the databases on each in sync with
each other. For this sort of purpose, both the local and remote databases
would be "idle" at the time of syncing.

	How about a single, seperate table with the fields of 'database',
'tablename', 'oid', 'last_changed', that would store the same data as your
PGR_TIME field. It would be seperated from the actually data tables, and
therefore would be totally transparent to any database interface
applications. The 'oid' field would hold each row's OID, a nice, unique
identification number for the row, while the other fields would tell which
table and database the oid is in. Then this table can be compared with the
this table on a remote machine to quickly find updates and changes, then
each differences can be dealt with in turn.

	I like this idea, better than any I have come up with yet. Though,
how are you going to handle DELETEs?

	Yea, this is indeed the sticky part, and would indeed require some
fine-tunning. Basically, the way I see it, is if the two timestamps for a
single row do not match (or even if the row and therefore timestamp is
missing on one side or the other altogether):
	local ts > remote ts => Local row is exported to remote.
	remote ts > local ts => Remote row is exported to local.
	local ts > last sync time && no remote ts => 
		Local row is inserted on remote.
	local ts < last sync time && no remote ts =>
		Local row is deleted.
	remote ts > last sync time && no local ts =>
		Remote row is inserted on local.
	remote ts < last sync time && no local ts =>
		Remote row is deleted.
where the synchronization process is running on the local machine. By
exported, I mean the local values are sent to the remote machine, and the
row on that remote machine is updated to the local values. How does this
sound?

	Or run manually for my purposes. Also, maybe follow it
with a vacuum run on both sides for all databases, as this is going to

	Initially, I would just stick to user table data... If you have
changes in triggers and other meta-data/executable code, you are going to
want to make syncs of that stuff manually anyway. At least I would want
to.

	Hence the reason for the seperate table with just a row's
identification and last update time. Only modifications to the synced
database is the update trigger, which should be pretty harmless.

	Just run the sync program as the postgres super user, and there
are no problems. :)

	No, not at all. Though it probably should be remaned from
replication to synchronization. The former is usually associated with a
continuous stream of updates between the local and remote databases, so
they are almost always in sync, and have a queuing ability if their
connection is loss for span of time as well. Very complex and difficult to
implement, and would require hacking server code. :( Something only Sybase
and Oracle have (as far as I know), and from what I have seen of Sybase's
replication server support (dated by 5yrs) it was a pain to setup and get
running correctly.
	The latter, synchronization, is much more managable, and can still
be useful, especially when you have a large database you want in two
places, mainly for read only purposes at one end or the other, but don't
want to waste the time/bandwidth to move and load the entire database each
time it changes on one end or the other. Same idea as mirroring software
for FTP sites, just transfers the changes, and nothing more.
	I also like the idea of using Python. I have been using it
recently for some database interfaces (to PostgreSQL of course :), and it
is a very nice language to work with. Some worries about performance of
the program though, as python is only an interpreted lanuage, and I have
yet to really be impressed with the speed of execution of my database
interfaces yet.
	Anyway, it sound like a good project, and finally one where I
actually have a clue of what is going on, and the skills to help. So, if
you are interested in pursing this project, I would be more than glad to
help. TTYL.

    I don't think it would matter if the databases are idle or not to be
honest with you.  At any single point in time when you replicate I'd figure
that the database would be in a consistent state.  So, you should be able to
replicate (or sync) a remote database that is in use.  After all, you're
getting a snapshot of the database as it stands at 8:45 PM.  At 8:46 PM it
may be totally different...but the next time syncing takes place those
changes would appear in your local copy.

    The one problem you may run into is if the remote host is running a
large batch process.  It's very likely that you will get 50% of their
changes when you replicate...but then again, that's why you can schedule the
event to work around such things.

    The problem with OID's is that they are unique at the local level but if
you try and use them between servers you can run into overlap.  Also, if a
database is under heavy use this table could quickly become VERY large.  Add
indexes to this table to help performance and you're taking up even more
disk space.

    Using the PGR_TIME field with an index will allow us to find rows which
have changed VERY quickly.  All we need to do now is somehow programatically
find the primary key for a table so the person setting up replication (or
syncing) doesn't have to have an indepth knowledge of the schema in order to
setup a syncing schedule.

    The replication part will be the most complex...that much is for
certain...

    I've been writing systems in Lotus Notes/Domino for the last year or so
and I've grown quite spoiled with what it can do in regards to replication.
It's not real-time but you have to gear your applications to this type of
thing (it's possible to create documents, fire off email to notify people of
changes and have the email arrive before the replicated documents do).
Replicating large Notes/Domino databases takes quite a while....I don't see
any kind of replication or syncing running in a blink of an eye.

    Having said that, a good algo will have to be written to cut down on
network traffic and to keep database conversations down to a minimum.  This
will be appreciated by people with low bandwidth connections I'm sure
(dial-ups, fractional T1's, etc).

    It could probably be named either way...but the one thing I really don't
want to do is start hacking server code.  The PostgreSQL people have enough
to do without worrying about trying to meld anything I've done to their
server.   :)

    Besides, I like the idea of having it operate as a stand-alone product.
The only PostgreSQL feature we would require would be triggers and
plpgsql...what was the earliest version of PostgreSQL that supported
plpgsql?  Even then I don't see the triggers being that complex to boot.

    The only thing we'd need for Python is the Python extensions for
PostgreSQL...which in turn requires libpq and that's about it.  So, it
should be able to run on any platform supported by Python and libpq.  Using
TK for the interface components will require NT people to get additional
software from the 'net.  At least it did with older version of Windows
Python.  Unix folks should be happy....assuming they have X running on the
machine doing the replication or syncing.  Even then I wrote a curses based
Python interface awhile back which allows buttons, progress bars, input
fields, etc (I called it tinter and it's available at
http://iximd.com/~dwalker).  It's a simple interface and could probably be
cleaned up a bit but it works.  :)

    That would be a Good Thing.  Have webspace somewhere?  If I can get
permission from the "powers that be" at the office I could host a website on
our (Domino) webserver.

	Yea, forgot about that point, but became dead obvious once you

	Hmm... Yea, maybe look to see which field(s) has a primary, unique
index on it? Then use those field(s) as a primary key. Just require that
any table to be synchronized to have some set of fields that uniquely
identify each row. Either that, or add another field to each table with
our own, cross system consistent, identification system. Don't know which
would be more efficient and easier to work with.
	The former could potentially get sticky if it takes a lots of
fields to generate a unique key value, but has the smallest effect on the
table to be synced. The latter could be difficult to keep straight between
systems (local vs. remote), and would require a trigger on inserts to
generate a new, unique id number, that does not exist locally or
remotely (nasty issue there), but would remove the uniqueness
requirement.

	Or, according to my logic below, if a row is missing on one side
or the other, then just compare the remaining row's timestamp to the last
synchronization time (stored in a seperate table/db elsewhere). The
results of the comparsion and the state of row existences tell one if the
row was inserted or deleted since the last sync, and what should be done
to perform the sync.

	Of course! In reflection, the assigned identification number I
mentioned above might be the best then, instead of having to transfer the
entire set of key fields back and forth.

>     What would a vacuum do to a system being used by many people?

	Probably lock them out of tables while they are vacuumed... Maybe
not really required in the end, possibly optional?

	Yea, they probably would appreciate that. They already have enough
on thier plate for 7.x as it is! :)

	No, provided that we don't do the identification number idea
(which the more I think about it, probably will not work). As for what
version support plpgsql, I don't know, one of the more hard-core pgsql
hackers can probably tell us that.

	Of course. If it ran on NT as well as Linux/Unix, that would be
even better. :)

	Why would we want any type of GUI (X11 or curses) for this sync
program. I imagine just a command line program with a few options (local
machine, remote machine, db name, etc...), and nothing else.
	Though I will take a look at your curses interface, as I have been
wanting to make a curses interface to a few db interfaces I have, in a
simple as manner as possible.

	Yea, I got my own web server (www.rkirkpat.net) with 1GB+ of disk
space available, sitting on a decent speed DSL. Even can setup of a
virtual server if we want (i.e. pgsync.rkirkpat.net :). CVS repository,
email lists, etc... possible with some effort (and time). 
	So, where should we start? TTYL.

	PS. The current pages on my web site are very out of date at the
moment (save for the pgsql information). I hope to have updated ones up
within the week.

Hi Guys,

Now for one of my REALLY rare posts.
Having done a little bit of distributed data systems, I figured I'd
pitch in a couple cents worth.

>    table in each database that needs to be re plicated. &nbsp;This

I just started reading this thread, but I figured I'd throw in a couple
suggestions for distributed data control  (a few idioms I've had to
deal with b4):
	- Never use time (not reliable from system to system).  Use
	  a version number of some sort that can stay consistent across
	  all replicas

	  This way, if a system's time is or goes out of wack, it doesn't
	  cause your database to disintegrate, and it's easier to track
	  conflicts (see below.  If using time, the algorithm gets
	  nightmarish)

	- On an insert, set to version 1

	- On an update, version++

	- On a delete, mark deleted, and add a delete stub somewhere for the
	  replicator process to deal with in sync'ing the databases.

	- If two records have the same version but different data, there's
	  a conflict.  A few choices:
	  	1.  Pick one as the correct one (yuck!! invisible data loss)
		2.  Store both copies, pick one as current, and alert 
		    database owner of the conflict, so they can deal with
		    it "manually."
		3.  If possible, some conflicts can be merged.  If a disjoint
		    set of fields were changed in each instance, these changes
		    may both be applied and the record merged.  (Problem:
		    takes a lot more space.  Requires a version number for
		    every field, or persistent storage of some old records.
		    However, this might help the "which fields changed" issue
		    you were talking about in #6)

	- A unique id across all systems should exist (or something that
	  effectively simulates a unique id.  Maybe a composition of the
	  originating oid (from the insert) and the originating database
	  (oid of the database's record?) might do it.  Store this as
	  an extra field in every record.  
	  
	  (Two extra fieldss so far: 'unique id' and 'version')

I do like your approach:  triggers and a separate process. (Maintainable!! :)

Anyway, just figured I'd throw in a few suggestions,
Duane

Hi all!

Here is a small patch to make postgres a distributed database. By
distributed I mean that you can have the same copy of the database on N
different machines and keep them all in sync.
It does not improve performances unless you distribute your clients in a
sensible manner. It does not allow you to do parallel selects.

The support page is : pages.infinit.net/daemon  and soon to be in
english.

The patch was tested with RedHat Linux 6.0 on Intel with kernel 2.2.11.
Only two machines where used so i'm not competely sure that it works
with more than two. -But it should-

I would like to know if somebody else is interested in this otherwise
i'm probably not gonna keep it growing. So please reply me to my e-mail
(P.Marchesso@videotron.ca) to give me an idea of the amount of people
interested in this.

Thanks all.

Philippe Marchesseault

Hi,

I look at your (Philippe's) replicator, but I don't good understand
your replication concept.


    node1:  SQL --IPC--> node-broker
                       |
                      TCP/IP
                       |
                    master-node --IPC--> replikator
                                         |   |   |
                                           libpq
                                         |   |   |
                                       node2 node..n     

(Is it right picture?)

If I good understand, all nodes make connection to master node and data
replicate "replicator" on this master node. But it (master node) is very
critical space in this concept - If master node not work replication for 
*all* nodes is lost. Hmm.. but I want use replication for high available
applications...

IMHO is problem with node registration / authentification on master node.
Why concept is not more upright? As:

	SQL --IPC--> node-replicator
			|  |  | 
		     via libpq send data to all nodes with
                     current client/backend auth.

	(not exist any master node, all nodes have connection to all nodes)	


Use replicator as external proces and copy data from SQL to this replicator
via IPC is (your) very good idea.

 Hi,

 I a little explore replication conception on Oracle and Sybase (in manuals).
(Know anyone some interesting links or publication about it?)

 Firstly, I sure, untimely is write replication to PgSQL now, if we
haven't exactly conception for it. It need more suggestion from more
developers. We need firstly answers for next qestion:

	1/ How replication concept choose for PG?
	2/ How manage transaction for nodes? (and we need define any 
           replication protocol for this)
	3/ How involve replication in current PG transaction code?

My idea (dream:-) is replication that allow you use full read-write on all
nodes and replication which use current transaction method in PG - not is
difference between more backends on one host or more backend on more hosts
- it makes "global transaction consistency".

Now is transaction manage via ICP (one host), my dream is alike manage 
this transaction, but between more host via TCP. (And make optimalization 
for this - transfer commited data/commands only.)


Any suggestion?


-------------------
Note:
 
(transaction oriented replication)

 Sybase - I. model (only one node is read-write) 

	 primary SQL data (READ-WRITE)
                |
	 replication agent (transaction log monitoring)
		|
	 primary distribution server (one or more repl. servers)
	        |               /  |  \
                |            nodes (READ-ONLY)
                |
         secondary dist. server
                          /  |  \
                       nodes (READ-ONLY)


       If primary SQL is read-write and the other nodes *read-only* 
       => system good work if connection is disable (data are save to
          replication-log and if connection is available log is write 
	  to node).   


 Sybase - II. model (all nodes read-write)

     	    SQL data 1 --->--+                        NODE I.
                |            |
                ^            |
	        |     replication agent 1 (transaction log monitoring)
                V        |
		|        V
                |        |
         replication server 1
                |
		^
                V
                |
         replication server 2                        NODE II.
                |         |
                ^         +-<-->--- SQL data 2
                |                    |                      
               replcation agent 2 -<--



Sorry, I not sure if I re-draw previous picture total good..

Two way replication on a single "table" is availabe in Lotus Notes. In
Notes, every record has a time-stamp, which contains the time of the
last update. (It also has a creation timestamp.) During replication,
timestamps are compared at the row/record level, and compared with the
timestamp of the last replication. If, for corresponding rows in two
replicas, the timestamp of one row is newer than the last replication,
the contents of this newer row is copied to the other replica. But if
both of the corresponding rows have newer timestamps, there is a
problem. The Lotus Notes solution is to:
  1. send a replication conflict message to the Notes Administrator,
which message contains full copies of both rows.
  2. copy the newest row over the less new row in the replicas.
  3. there is a mechanism for the Administrator to reverse the default
decision in 2, if the semantics of the message history, or off-line
investigation indicates that the wrong decision was made.

In practice, the Administrator is not overwhelmed with replication
conflict messages because updates usually only originate at the site
that originally created the row. Or updates fill only fields that were
originally 'TBD'. The full logic is perhaps more complicated than I have
described here, but it is already complicated enough to give you an idea
of what you're really being asked to do. I am not aware of a supplier of
relational database who really supports two way replication at the level
that Notes supports it, but Notes isn't a relational database.

The difficulty of the position that you appear to be in is that
management might believe that the full problem is solved in brand X
RDBMS, and you will have trouble convincing management that this is not
really true.

For a SCADA system (Supervisory Control and Data Akquisition) which consists
of one  master and one hot-standby server I have implemented such a
solution. To these UNIX servers client workstations are connected (NT and/or
UNIX). The database client programms run on client and server side.

When developing this approach I had to goals in mind:
1) Not to get dependend on the PostgreSQL sources since they change very
dynamically.
2) Not to get dependend on the fe/be protocol  since there are discussions
around to change it.

So the approach is quite simple: Forward all database requests to the
standby server on TCP/IP level.

On both servers the postmaster listens on port 5433 and not on 5432. On
standard port 5432 my program listens instead. This program forks twice for
every incomming connection. The first instance forwards all packets from the
frontend to both backends. The second instance receives the packets from all
backends and forwards the packets from the master backend to the frontend.
So a frontend running on a server machine connects to port 5432 of
localhost.

On the client machine runs another program (on NT as a service). This
program forks for every incomming connections twice. The first instance
forwards all packets to port 5432 of the current master server and the
second instance forwards the packets from the master server to the frontend.

During standby computer startup the database of the master computer is
dumped, zipped, copied to the standby computer, unzipped and loaded into
that database.
If a standby startup took place, all client connections are aborted to allow
a login into the standby database. The frontends need to reconnect in this
case. So the database of the standby computer is always in sync.

The disadvantage of this method is that a query cannot be canceled in the
standby server since the request key of this connections gets lost. But we
can live with that.

Both programms are able to run on Unix and on (native!) NT. On NT threads
are created instead of forked processes.

This approach is simple, but it is effective and it works.

We hope to survive this way until real replication will be implemented in
PostgreSQL.

This wouldn't work for READ COMMITTED isolation level.
But why do you want to log commands into WAL where each modification
is already logged in, hm, correct order?
Well, it has sense if you're looking for async replication but
you need not in two-phase commit for this and should aware about
problems with READ COMMITTED isolevel.

Back to two-phase commit - it's easiest part of work required for
distributed transaction processing.
Currently we place single commit record to log and transaction is
committed when this record (and so all other transaction records)
is on disk.
Two-phase commit:

1. For 1st phase we'll place into log "prepared-to-commit" record
   and this phase will be accomplished after record is flushed on disk.
   At this point transaction may be committed at any time because of
   all its modifications are logged. But it still may be rolled back
   if this phase failed on other sites of distributed system.

2. When all sites are prepared to commit we'll place "committed"
   record into log. No need to flush it because of in the event of
   crash for all "prepared" transactions recoverer will have to
   communicate other sites to know their statuses anyway.

That's all! It is really hard to implement distributed lock- and
communication- managers but there is no problem with logging two
records instead of one. Period.

I believe the issue here is that while SERIALIZABLE ISOLATION means all
queries can be run serially, our default is READ COMMITTED, meaning that
open transactions see committed transactions, even if the transaction
committed after our transaction started.  (FYI, see my chapter on
transactions for help,  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html.)

To do higher-level WAL, you would have to record not only the queries,
but the other queries that were committed at the start of each command
in your transaction.

Ideally, you could number every commit by its XID your log, and then
when processing the query, pass the "committed" transaction ids that
were visible at the time each command began.

In other words, you can replay the queries in transaction commit order,
except that you have to have some transactions committed at specific
points while other transactions are open, i.e.:

XID	Open XIDS	Query
500			UPDATE t SET col = 3;
501	500		BEGIN;
501	500		UPDATE t SET col = 4;
501			UPDATE t SET col = 5;
501			COMMIT;

This is a silly example, but it shows that 500 must commit after the
first command in transaction 501, but before the second command in the
transaction.  This is because UPDATE t SET col = 5 actually sees the
changes made by transaction 500 in READ COMMITTED isolation level.

I am not advocating this.  I think WAL is a better choice.  I just
wanted to outline how replaying the queries in commit order is 
insufficient.

Not to be confused with replication, my concept of synchronization is to
manage changes between a server table (or tables) and one or more mobile,
disconnected databases (i.e. PalmPilot, laptop, etc.).

I read through the notes in the TODO for this topic and devised a tool kit
for doing synchronization.  I hope that the Postgresql development community
will find this useful and will help me refine this concept by offering
insight, experience and some good old fashion hacking if you are so
inclined.

The bottom of this message describes how to use the attached files.

I look forward to your feedback.

Methodology:

I devised a concept that I call "session versioning".  This means that every
time a row changes it does NOT get a new version.  Rather it gets stamped
with the current session version common to all published tables.  Clients,
when they connect for synchronization, will immediately increment this
common version number reserve the result as a "post version" and then
increment the session version again.  This version number, implemented as a
sequence, is common to all synchronized tables and rows.

Any time the server makes changes to the row gets stamped with the current
session version, when the client posts its changes it uses the reserved
"post version".  The client then makes all it's changes stamping the changed
rows with it's reserved "post version" rather than the current version.  The
reason why is explained later.  It is important that the client post all its
own changes first so that it does not end up receiving records which changed
since it's last session that it is about to update anyway.

Reserving the post version is a two step process.  First, the number is
simply stored in a variable for later use.  Second, the value is added to a
lock table (last_stable) to indicate to any concurrent sessions that rows
with higher version numbers are to be considered "unstable" at the moment
and they should not attempt to retrieve them at this time.  Each client,
upon connection, will use the lowest value in this lock table (max_version)
to determine the upper boundary for versions it should retrieve.  The lower
boundary is simply the  previous session's "max_version" plus one.  Thus
when the client retrieves changes is uses the following SQL "where"
expression:

WHERE row_version >= max_version and row_version <= last_stable_version and
version <> this_post_version

The point of reserving and locking a post version is important in that it
allows concurrent synchronization by multiple clients.  The first, of many,
clients to connect basically dictates to all future clients that they must
not take any rows equal to or greater than the one which it just reserved
and locked.  The reason the session version is incremented a second time is
so that the server may continue to post changes concurrent with any client
changes and be certain that these concurrent server changes will not taint
rows the client is about to retrieve. Once the client is finished with it's
session it removes the lock on it's post version.

Partitioning data for use by each node is the next challenge we face.  How
can we control which "slice" of data each client receives?  A slice can be
horizontal or vertical within a table.  Horizontal slices are easy,  it's
just the where clause of an SQL statement that says "give me the rows that
match X criteria".  We handle this by storing and appending a where clause
to each client's retrieval statement  in addition to where clause described
above.  Actually, two where clauses are stored and appended.  One is per
client and one is per publication (table).

We defined horizontal slices by filtering rows.  Vertical slices are limits
by column.  The tool kit does provide a mechanism for pseudo vertical
partitioning.  When a client is "subscribed" to a publication, the toolkit
stores what columns that node is to receive during a session.  These are
stored in the subscribed_cols table.  While this does limit the number
columns transmitted, the insert/update/delete triggers do not recognize
changes based on columns.   The "pseudo" nature of our vertical partitioning
is evident by example:

Say you have a table with name, address and phone number as columns.  You
restrict a client to see only name and address.  This means that phone
number information will not be sent to the client during synchronization,
and the client can't attempt to alter the phone number of a given entry.
Great, but . . . if, on the server, the phone number (but not the name or
address) is changed, the entire row gets marked with a new version.  This
means that the name and address will get sent to the client even though they
didn't change.

Well, there's the flaw in vertical partitioning.  Other than wasting
bandwidth, the extra row does no harm to the process.  The workaround for
this is to highly normalize your schema when possible.

Collisions are the next crux one encounters with synchronization.  When two
clients retrieve the same row and both make (different)changes, which one is
correct?  So far the system operates totally independent of time.  This is
good because it doesn't rely on the server or client to keep accurate time.
We can just ignore time all together, but then we force our clients to
synchronize on a strict schedule in order to avoid (or reduce) collisions.
If every node synchronized immediately after making changes we could just
stop here.  Unfortunately this isn't reality.  Reality dictates that of two
clients: Client A & B will each pick up the same record on Monday.  A will
make changes on Monday, then leave for vacation.  B will make changes on
Wednesday because new information was gathered in A's absence.  Client B
posts those changes Wednesday.  Meanwhile, client A returns from vacation on
Friday and synchronizes his changes.  A over writes B's changes even though
A made changes before the most recent information was posted by B.

It is clear that we need some form of time stamp to cope with the above
example.  While clocks aren't the most reliable, they are the only common
version control available to solve this problem.  The system is set up to
accept (but not require) timestamps from clients and changes on the server
are time stamped.  The system, when presented a time stamp with a row, will
compare them to figure out who wins in a tie.   The system makes certain
"sanity" checks with regard to these time stamps.  A client may not attempt
to post a change with a timestamp that is more than one hour in the future
(according to what the server thinks "now" is) nor one hour before it's last
synchronization date/time.  The client row will be immediately placed into
the collision table if the timestamp is that far out of whack.
Implementations of the tool kit should take care to ensure that client &
server agree on what "now" is before attempting to submit changes with
timestamps.

Time stamps are not required.  Should a client be incapable of tracking
timestamps, etc.  The system will assume that any server row which has been
changed since the client's last session will win a tie.  This is quite error
prone, so timestamps are encouraged where possible.

Inserts pose an interesting challenge.  Since multiple clients cannot share
a sequence (often used as a primary key) while disconnected.  They will be
responsible for their own unique "row_id" when inserting records.   Inserts
accept any arbitrary key, and write back to the client a special kind of
update that gives the server's row_id.  The client is responsible for making
sure that this update takes place locally.

Deletes are the last portion of the process.  When deletes occur, the
row_id, version, etc. are stored in a "deleted" table.  These entries are
retrieved by the client using the same version filter as described above.
The table is pruned at the end of each session by deleting all records with
versions that are less than the lowest 'last_version' stored for each
client.

Having wrapped up the synchronization process, I'll move on to describe some
points about managing clients, publications and the like.

The tool kit is split into two objects: SyncManagement and Synchronization.
The Synchronization object exposes an API that client implementations use to
communicate and receive changes.  The management functions handle system
install and uninstall in addition to publication of tables and client
subscriptions.

Installation and uninstallation are handled by their corresponding functions
in the API.  All system tables are prefixed and suffixed with four
underscores, in hopes that this avoids conflict with an existing tables.
Calling the install function more than once will generate an error message.
Uninstall will remove all related tables, sequences,  functions and triggers
from the system.

The first step, after installing the system, is to publish a table.  A table
can be published more than once under different names.  Simply provide a
unique name as the second argument to the publish function.  Since object
names are restricted to 32 characters in Postgres, each table is given a
unique id and this id is used to create the trigger and sequence names.
Since one table can be published multiple times, but only needs one set of
triggers and one sequence for change management a reference count is kept so
that we know when to add/drop triggers and functions.  By default, all
columns are published, but the third argument to the publish function
accepts an array reference of column names that allows you to specify a
limited set.  Information about the table is stored in the "tables" table,
info about the publication is in the "publications" table and column names
are stored in "subscribed_cols" table.

The next step is to subscribe a client to a table.  A client is identified
by a user name and a node name.  The subscribe function takes three
arguments: user, node & publication.  The subscription process writes an
entry into the "subscribed" table with default values.  Of note, the
"RefreshOnce" attribute is set to true whenever a table is published.  This
indicates to the system that a full table refresh should be sent the next
time the client connects even if the client requests synchronization rather
than refresh.

The toolkit does not, yet, provide a way to manage the whereclause stored at
either the publication or client level.  To use or test this feature, you
will need to set the whereclause attributes manually.

Tables and users can be unpublished and unsubscribed using the corresponding
functions within the tool kit's management interface.  Because postgres
lacks an "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN" function, the unpublish function only
removes default values and indexes for those columns.

The API isn't the most robust thing in the world right now.  All functions
return undef on success and an error string otherwise (like DBD).  I hope to
clean up the API considerably over the next month.  The code has not been
field tested at this time.


The files attached are:

1) SynKit.pm (A perl module that contains install/uninstall functions and a
simple api for synchronization & management)

2) sync_install.pl (Sample code to demonstrate the installation, publishing
and subscribe process)

3) sync_uninstall.pl (Sample code to demonstrate the uninstallation,
unpublishing and unsubscribe process)


To use them on Linux (don't know about Win32 but should work fine):

 - set up a test database and make SURE plpgsql is installed

 - install perl 5.05 along with Date::Parse(TimeDate-1.1) , DBI and DBD::Pg
modules [www.cpan.org]

 - copy all three attached files to a test directory

 - cd to your test directory

 - edit all three files and change the three DBI variables to suit your
system (they are clearly marked)

 - % perl sync_install.pl

 - check out the tables, functions & triggers installed

 - % perl sync.pl

 - check out the 'sync_test' table, do some updates/inserts/deletes and run
sync.pl again
        NOTE: Sanity checks default to allow no more than 50% of the table
to be changed by the client in a single session.
        If you delete all (or most of) the rows  you will get errors when
you run sync.pl again! (by design)

 - % perl sync_uninstall.pl  (when you are done)

 - check out  the sample scripts and the perl module code (commented, but
not documented)

We have been researching replication for several months now, and
I have some opinions to share to the community for feedback,
discussion, and/or participation. Our goal is to get a replication
solution for PostgreSQL that will meet most needs of users
and applications alike (mission impossible theme here :). 

My research work along with others contributors has been collected
and presented here http://www.greatbridge.org/genpage?replication_top
If there is something missing, especially PostgreSQL related
work, I would like to know about it, and my apologies to any
one who got left off the list. This work is ongoing and doesn't
draw a conclusion, which IMHO should be left up to the user,
but I'm offering my opinions to spur discussion and/or feed back
from this list, and try not to offend any one.

Here's my opinion: of the approaches we've surveyed, the most
promising one is the Postgres-R project from the Information and
Communication Systems Group, ETH  in Zurich, Switzerland, originally 
produced by Bettina Kemme, Gustavo Alonso, and others.  Although 
Postgres-R is a synchronous approach, I believe it is the closest to 
the goal mentioned above. Here is an abstract of the advantages.

1) Postgres-R is built on the PostgreSQL-6.4.2 code base.  The 
replication 
functionality is an optional parameter, so there will be insignificant 
overhead for non replication situations. The replication and 
communication
managers are the two new modules added to the PostgreSQL code base.

2) The replication manager's main function is controlling the
replication protocol via a message handling process. It receives
messages from the local and remote backends and forwards write
sets and decision messages via the communication manager to the
other servers. The replication manager controls all the transactions 
running on the local server by keeping track of the states, including 
which protocol phase (read, send, lock, or write) the transaction is
in. The replication manager maintains a two way channel
implemented as buffered sockets to each backend.

3) The main task of the communication manager is to provide simple
socket based interface between the replication manager and the
group communication system (currently Ensemble). The
communication system is a cluster of servers connected via
the communication manager.  The replication manager also maintains
three one-way channels to the communication system: a broadcast
channel to send messages, a total-order channel to receive
totally orders write sets, and a no-order channel to listen for
decision messages from the communication system. Decision
messages can be received at any time where the reception of
totally ordered write sets can be blocked in certain phases.

4) Based on a two phase locking approach, all dead lock situations
are local and detectable by Postgres-R code base, and aborted.

5) The write set messages used to send database changes to other
servers, can use either the SQL statements or the actual tuples
changed. This is a parameter based on number of tuples changed
by a transaction. While sending the tuple changes reduces
overhead in query parse, plan and execution, there is a negative
effect in sending a large write set across the network.

6) Postgres-R uses a synchronous approach that keeps the data on 
all sites consistent and provides serializability. The user does not 
have to bother with conflict resolution, and receives the same 
correctness and consistency of a centralized system.

7) Postgres-R could be part of a good fault-resilient and load 
distribution 
solution.  It is peer-to-peer based and incurs low overhead propagating 
updates to the other cluster members.  All replicated databases locally 
process queries.

8) Compared to other synchronous replication strategies (e.g., standard 
distributed 2-phase-locking + 2-phase-commit), Postgres-R has much 
better performance using 2-phase-locking.


There are some issues that are not currently addressed by
Postgres-R, but some enhancements made to PostgreSQL since the
6.4.2 tree are very favorable to addressing these short comings.

1) The addition of WAL in 7.1 has the information for recovering 
failed/off-line servers, currently all the servers would have to be 
stopped, and a copy would be used to get all the servers synchronized
before starting again. 

2)Being synchronous, Postgres-R would not be a good solution 
for off line/WAN scenarios where asynchronous replication is 
required.  There are some theories on this issue which involve servers
connecting and disconnecting from the cluster.

3)As in any serialized synchronous approach there is  change in the 
flow of execution of a transaction; while most of these changes can 
be solved by calling newly developed functions at certain time points, 
synchronous replica control is tightly coupled with the concurrency 
control.
Hence, especially in PostgreSQL 7.2 some parts of the concurrency control
(MVCC) might have to be adjusted. This can lead to a slightly more 
complicated maintenance than a system that does not change the backend.

4)Partial replication is not addressed. 


Any feedback on this post will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Darren

what does "manager controls all the transactions" mean? I hope it does

Does this imply locking over different servers? That would mean a

Coming from a Sybase background I have some experience with
replication. The way it works in Sybase Replication server is as
follows:
- for each replicated database, there is a "log reader" process that
reads the WAL and captures only *committed transactions* to the
replication server. (it does not make much sense to replicate other
things IMHO :-).
- the replication server stores incoming data in a que ("stable
device"), until it is sure it has reached its final destination

- a replication server can send data to another replication server in
a compact (read: WAN friendly) way. A chain of replication servers can
be made, depending on network architecture)

- the final replication server makes a almost standard client
connection to the target database and translates the compact
transactions back to SQL statements. By using masks, extra
functionality can be built in. 

This kind of architecture has several advantages:
- only committed transactions are replicated which saves overhead
- it does not have very much impact on performance of the source
server (apart from reading the WAL)
- since every replication server has a stable device, data is stored
when the network is down and nothing gets lost (nor stops performing)
- because only the log reader and the connection from the final
replication server are RDBMS specific, it is possible to replicate
from MS to Oracle using a Sybase replication server (or different
versions etc).

I do not know how much of this is patented or copyrighted, but the
architecture seems elegant and robust to me. I have done
implementations of bi-directional replication too. It *is* possible
but does require some funky setup and maintenance. (but it is better
that letting offices on different continents working on the same
database :-)

just my 2 EURO cts  :-)

Yes, the above architecture is what almost every vendor of replication
software uses. And I'm sure if you worked much with Sybase, you hate the
garbage that their repserver is :). 

The architecture of postgres-r and repserver are fundamentally different
for a good reason: repserver only wants to replicate committed
transactions, while postgres-r is more of a 'clustering' solution (albeit
they don't say this word), and is capable to do much more than simple rep
server. 

I.E. you can safely put half of your clients to second server in a
replicated postgres-r cluster without being worried that a conflict (or a
wierd locking situation) may occur.

Try that with sybase, it is fundamentally designed for one-way
replication, and the fact that you can do one-way replication in both
directions doesn't mean its safe to do that!

I'm not sure how postgres-r handles network problems. To be useful, a good
replication solution must have an option of "no network->no updates" as
well as "no network->queue updates and send them later". However, it is
far easier to add queuing to a correct 'eager locking' database than it is
to add proper locking to a queue-based replicator.

Thanks for the feedback.  I'll try to address both your issues here.

The replication manager controls the transactions by serializing the 
write set messages. 
This ensures all transactions are committed in the same order on each 
server, so bugs
here are not allowed  ;-)

There is a branch of the Postgres-R code that has some failure detection 
implemented,
so we will have to merge this functionality with the version of 
Postgres-R we have, and
test this issue.  I'll let you the results.

I like this idea for recovering servers that have been down a short 
period of time, using WAL
to recover transactions missed during the outage.

There are some issues with the "log reader" approach:
1) The databases are not synchronized until the log reader completes its 
processing.
2) I'm not sure about Sybase, but the log reader sends SQL statements to 
the other servers
which are then parsed, planned and executed.  This over head could be 
avoided if only
the tuple changes are replicated.
3) Works fine for read only situations, but peer-to-peer applications 
using this approach
must be designed with a conflict resolution scheme. 

Don't get me wrong, I believe we can learn from the replication 
techniques used by commercial
databases like Sybase, and try to implement the good ones into 
PostgreSQL.  Postgres-R is
a synchronous approach which out performs the traditional approaches to 
synchronous replication.
Being based on PostgreSQL-6.4.2, getting this approach in the 7.2 tree 
might be better than
reinventing the wheel.

Thanks again,

Darren

If you only want synchronous replication, why not simply use triggers ?
All you would then need is remote query access and two phase commit,
and maybe a little script that helps create the appropriate triggers.

Doing a replicate all or nothing approach that only works synchronous
is imho not flexible enough.

Hello

I have hacked up a replication layer for Perl code accessing a
database throught the DBI interface. It works pretty well with MySQL
(I can run pre-bender slashcode replicated, haven't tried the more
recent releases).

Potentially this hack should also work with Pg but I haven't tried
yet. If someone would like to test it out with a complex Pg app and
let me know how it went that would be cool.

The replication layer is based on Eric Newton's Recall replication
library (www.fault-tolerant.org/recall), and requires that all
database accesses be through the DBI interface.

The replicas are live, in that every operation affects all the
replicas in real time. Replica outages are invisible to the user, so
long as a majority of the replicas are functioning. Disconnected
replicas can be used for read-only access.

The only code modification that should be required to use the
replication layer is to change the DSN in connect():

  my $replicas = '192.168.1.1:7000,192.168.1.2:7000,192.168.1.3:7000';
  my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:Recall:database=$replicas");

You should be able to install the replication modules with:

perl -MCPAN -eshell
cpan> install Replication::Recall::DBServer

and then install DBD::Recall (which doesn't seem to be accessible from
the CPAN shell yet, for some reason), by:

wget http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/AGUL/DBD-Recall-1.10.tar.gz
tar xzvf DBD-Recall-1.10.tar.gz
cd DBD-Recall-1.10
perl Makefile.PL
make install

I would be very interested in hearing about your experiences with
this...

Thanks

> which I believe is what the rserv implementation in contrib currently

> ... no?

We tried rserv, PG Link (Joseph Conway), and PosrgreSQL Replicator.  All
these projects are trigger based asynchronous replication.  They all have
some advantages over the current functionality of Postgres-R some of 
which I believe can be addressed:

1) Partial replication - being able to replicate just one or part of a
table(s)
2) They make no changes to the PostgreSQL code base. (Postgres-R can't 
address this one ;)
3) PostgreSQL Replicator has some very nice conflict resolution schemes.


Here are some disadvantages to using a "trigger based" approach:

1) Triggers simply transfer individual data items when they are modified,
they do not keep track of transactions.
2) The execution of triggers within a database imposes a performance 
overhead to that database.
3) Triggers require careful management by database administrators.  
Someone needs to keep track of all the "alarms" going off.
4) The activation of triggers in a database cannot be easily 
rolled back or undone.

I agree.  Partial and asynchronous replication need to be addressed, 
and some of the common functionality of Postgres-R could possibly 
be used to meet those needs. 
 

Thanks for your feedback,

I don't know about other *async* replication engines but Rserv
keeps track of transactions (if I understood you corectly).
Rserv transfers not individual modified data items but
*consistent* snapshot of changes to move slave database from
one *consistent* state (when all RI constraints satisfied)
to another *consistent* state.

What do you mean?

I thought Andreas did a good job of correcting me here. Transaction-
based replication with triggers do not apply to points 1 and 4.  I
should have made a distinction between non-transaction and 
transaction based replication with triggers.  I was not trying to
single out rserv or any other project, and I can see how my wording 
implies this misinterpretation (my apologies).

> What do you mean?

Once the trigger fires, it is not an easy task  to abort that 
execution via rollback or undo.  Again this is not an issue 
with a transaction-based trigger approach.


Sincerely,

Darren

Yes, points 2 and 3 are a given, although point 2 buys you the functionality
of transparent locking across all involved db servers.
Points 1 and 4 are only the case for a trigger mechanism that does 
not use remote connection and 2-phase commit. 

Imho an implementation that opens a separate client connection to the 
replication target is only suited for async replication, and for that a WAL 
based solution would probably impose less overhead.

Yes there is significant overhead with opening a connection to a 
client, so Postgres-R creates a pool of backends at start up, 
coupled with the group communication system (Ensemble) that
significantly reduces this issue.


Very good points,

Well as I read back the thread I see 2 different approaches to
replication:

1: tight integrated replication. 
pro:
- bi-directional (or multidirectional): updates are possible
everywhere
- A cluster of servers allways has the same state. 
- it does not matter to which server you connect
con:
- network between servers will be a bottleneck, especially if it is a
WAN connection
- only full replication possible
- what happens if one server is down? (or the network between) are
commits still possible

2: async replication
pro:
- long distance possible
- no problems with network outages
- only changes are replicated, selects do not have impact 
- no locking issues accross servers
- partial replication possible (many->one (datawarehouse), or one-many
(queries possible everywhere, updates only central) 
- goof for failover situations (backup server is standing by)
con:
- bidirectional replication hard to set up (you'll have to implement
conflict resolution according to your business rules)
- different servers are not guaranteed to be in the same state.

I can think of some scenarios where I would definitely want to
*choose* one of the options. A load-balanced web environment would
likely want the first option, but synchronizing offices in different
continents might not work with 2-phase commit over the network....

And we have not even started talking about *managing* replicated
environments. A lot of fail-over scenarios stop planning after the
backup host has take control. But how to get back?

Yes.  IIRC, it looks to be possible to support a form of async
replication using the Postgres-R approach: you allow the cluster
to break apart when communications fail, and then rejoin when
your link comes back to life.  (This can work in principle, how
close it is to reality is another question; but the rejoin operation
is the same as crash recovery, so you have to have it anyway.)

So this seems to me to allow getting most of the benefits of the async
approach.  OTOH it is difficult to see how to go the other way: getting
the benefits of a synchronous solution atop a basically-async
implementation doesn't seem like it can work.

I do not understand that point, if it is trigger based, you 
have all the flexibility you need. (only some tables, only some rows,
different rows to different targets ....), 
(or do you mean not all targets, that could also be achieved with triggers)

No, updates are not possible if one target is not reachable, 
that would not be synchronous and would again need business rules
to resolve conflicts.

Allowing updates when a target is not reachable would require admin 
intervention.

Currently with Postgres-R, it is one database replicating all tables to 
all servers in the group communication system.  There are some ways 
around
this by invoking the -r option when a SQL statement should be replicated, 
and leaving the -r option off for non-replicated scenarios.  IMHO this is
not a good solution.  

A better solution will need to be implemented, which involves a 
subscription table(s) with relation/server information.  There are two
ideas for subscribing and receiving replicated data.

1) Receiver driven propagation - A simple solution where all 
transactions are propagated and the receiving servers will reference
the subscription information before applying updates.

2) Sender driven propagation - A more optimal and complex solution 
where servers do not receive any messages regarding data items for 
which they have not subscribed

> No, updates are not possible if one target is not reachable,

AFAIK, Postgres-R can still replicate if one target is not reachable,
but only to the remaining servers ;).  

There is a scenario that could arise if a server issues a lock 
request then fails or goes off line.  There is code that checks 
for this condition, which needs to be merged with the branch we have.

> to resolve conflicts.

Yes the failed server would not be synchronized, and getting this
failed server back in sync needs to be addressed.

> Allowing updates when a target is not reachable would require admin
> intervention.

In its current state yes, but our goal would be to eliminate this
requirement as well.

I re-wrote RServ.pm to C, and wrote a replication daemon. It works, but it
works like the whole rserv project. I don't like it.

OK, what the hell do we need to do to get PostgreSQL replicating?

well. (Ie only rows with COUNTRY='Canada' go to 
slave A, and  rows with COUNTRY='China' go to slave B).
But I'm not sure when I'll get to that.

Support for conflict resolution(If allow edits to be made on the slaves) 
would be nice.

I hope to be able to send a tarball with the source to the pgpatches list 
within the next few days.

We've been using the system operationally for a number of months and have
been happy with it.

I hope you understand that replication,  done right,  is a massive
project.  I know that Darren any myself (and the rest of the pg-repl
folks) have been waiting till 7.2 went gold till we did anymore work.  I
think we hope to have master / slave replicatin working for 7.3 and then
target multimaster for 7.4.  At least that's the hope.

I did a similar thing. I took the rserv trigger "as is," but rewrote the
replication support code. What I eventually did was write a "snapshot daemon"
which created snapshot files. Then a "slave daemon" which would check the last
snapshot applied and apply all the snapshots, in order, as needed. One would
run one of these daemons per slave server.

I do know how hard replication is. I also understand how important it is.

If you guys have a project going, and need developers, I am more than willing.

DBMirror doesn't use snapshot's instead it records a log of transactions 
that are committed to the database in a pair of tables.  
In the case of an INSERT this is the row that is being added.
In the case of a delete the primary key of the row being deleted.

And in the case of an UPDATE, the primary key before the update along with 
all of the data the row should have after an update.

Then for each slave database a perl script walks though the transactions 
that are pending for that host and reconstructs SQL to send the row edits 
to that host.  A record of the fact that transaction Y has been sent to 
host X is also kept.

When transaction X has been sent to all of the hosts that are in the 
system it is then deleted from the Pending tables.

I suspect that all of the information I'm storing in the Pending tables is 
also being stored by Postgres in its log but I haven't investigated how 
the information could be extracted(or how long it is kept for).  That 
would  reduce the extra storage overhead that the replication system 
imposes.

As I remember(Its been a while since I've looked at it) RServ uses OID's 
in its tables to point to the data that needs to be replicated.  We tried 
a similar approach but found difficulties with doing partial updates.

The trigger model is not a very sophisticated one. I think I have a better
-- though more complicated -- one. This model would be able to handle
multiple masters and master->slave.

First of all, all machines in the cluster would have to be aware all the
machines in the cluster. This would have to be stored in a new system
table.

The FE/BE protocol would need to be modified to accepted parsed node trees
generated by pg_analyze_and_rewrite(). These could then be dispatched by 
the executing server, inside of pg_exec_query_string, to all other servers
in the cluster (excluding itself). Naturally, this dispatch would need to
be non-blocking.

pg_exec_query_string() would need to check that nodetags to make sure
selects and perhaps some commands are not dispatched.

Before the executing server runs finish_xact_command(), it would check
that the query was successfully executed on all machines otherwise
abort. Such a system would need a few configuration options: whether or
not you abort on failed replication to slaves, the ability to replicate
only certain tables, etc.

Naturally, this would slow down writes to the system (possibly a lot
depending on the performance difference between the executing machine and
the least powerful machine in the cluster), but most usages of postgresql
are read intensive, not write.

Any reason this model would not work?

What, then is the purpose of replication to multiple masters?

I can think of only two reasons why you want replication. (1) Redundancy, make
sure that if one server dies, then another server has the same data and is used
seamlessly. (2) Increase performance over one system.

In reason (1) I submit that a server load balance which sits on top of
PostgreSQL, and executes writes on both servers while distributing reads would
be best. This is a HUGE project. The load balancer must know EXACTLY how the
system is configured, which includes all functions and everything. 

In reason (2) your system would fail to provide the scalability that would be
needed. If writes take a long time, but reads are fine, what is the difference
between the trigger based replicator?

I have in the back of my mind, an idea of patching into the WAL stuff, and
using that mechanism to push changes out to the slaves.

Where one machine is still the master, but no trigger stuff, just a WAL patch.
Perhaps some shared memory paradigm to manage WAL visibility? I'm not sure
exactly, the idea hasn't completely formed yet.

What you describe sounds like a form of a two-stage commit protocol.

If the command worked on two of the replicated databases but failed on a 
third then the executing server would have to be able to undo the command
on the replicated databases as well as itself.

The problems with two stage commit type approches to replication are 
1) Speed as you mentioned.  Write speed isn't a concern for some 
applications but it is very important in others.

and 
2) All of the databases must be able to communicate with each other at 
all times in order for any edits to work.   If the servers are 
connected over some sort of WAN that periodically has short outages this 
is a problem.   Also if your using replication because you want to be able 
to take down one of the databases for short periods of time without 
bringing down the others your in trouble.


btw: I posted the alternative to Rserv that I mentioned the other day to 
the  pg-patches mailing list.  If anyone is intreasted you should be able 
to grab it off the archives.

I'm not that familiar with the whole replication issues in PostgreSQL,
however, I would be partial to replication that was based upon the
playback of the (a?) journal file.  (I believe that the WAL is a
journal file.)

By being based upon a journal file, it would be possible to accomplish
two significant items.  First, it would be possible to "restore" a
database to an exact state just before a failure.  Most commercial
databases provide the ability to do this.  Banks, etc. log the journal
files directly to tape to provide a complete transaction history such
that they can rebuild their database from any given snapshot.  (Note
that the journal file needs to be "editable" as a failure may be
"delete from x" with a missing where clause.)

This leads directly into the second advantage, the ability to have a
replicated database operating anywhere, over any connection on any
server.  Speed of writes would not be a factor.  In essence, as long
as the replicated database had a snapshot of the database and then was
provided with all journal files since the snapshot, it would be
possible to build a current database.  If the replicant got behind in
the processing, it would catch up when things slowed down.

In my opionion, the first advantage is in many ways most important.
Replication becomes simply the restoration of the database in realtime
on a second server.  The "replication" task becomes the definition of
a protocol for distributing the journal file.  At least one major
database vendor does replication (shadowing) in exactly this mannor.

Maybe I'm all wet and the journal file and journal playback already
exists.  If so, IMHO, basing replication off of this would be the
right direction.

IMHO the biggest problem with two phased commit is it doesn't scale.
The more servers
you add to the replica the slower it goes.  Also there's the potential
for dead locks across
server boundaries.

All true for two phased commit protocol.  To have multi master
replication, you must have all
systems communicating, but you can use a multicast group communication
system instead of
2PC.  Using total order messaging, you can ensure all changes are
delivered to all servers in the
replica in the same order.   This group communication system also allows
failures to be detected
while other servers in the replica continue processing.

A few of us are working with this theory, and trying to integrate with
7.2.  There is a working
model for 6.4, but its very limited.  (insert, update, and deletes)  We
are currently hosted at

http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pgreplication/projdisplay.php
But the site has been down the last 2 days.  I've contacted the web
master, but haven't seen
any results yet.  If any one knows what going on with gborg, I'd
appreciate a status.

Darren,
Given that different replication strategies will probably be developed 
for PG, do you envisage DBAs to be able to select the type of replication 
for their installation? I.e. Replication being selectable rther like 
storage structures?

Would be a killer bit of flexibility, given how enormous the impact of 
replication will be to corporate adoption of PG.

I can't speak for other replication solutions, but we are using the 
--with-replication or
-r parameter when starting postmaster.  Some day I hope there will be 
parameters for
master/slave partial/full and sync/async,  but it will be some time 
before we cross those
bridges.

I've been looking into database replication theory lately and have found
some interesting papers discussing various approaches.  (Here's
one paper that struck me as being very helpful,
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/460405.html )  So far I favour an
eager replication system which is predicated on a read local/write all
available. The system should not depend on two phase commit or primary
copy algorithms.  The former leads to the whole system being as quick as
the slowest machine.  In addition, 2 phase commit involves 2n messages for
each transaction which does not scale well at all.  This idea will also
have to take into account a crashed node which did not ack a transaction.
The primary copy algorithms I've seen suffer from a single point of
failure and potential bottlenecks at the primary node.

Instead I like the master to master or peer to peer algorithm as discussed
in the above paper.  This approach accounts for network partitions, nodes
leaving and joining a cluster and the ability to commit a transaction once
the communication module has determined the total order of the said
transaction, i.e. no need for waiting for acks.   This scales well and
research has shown it to increase the number of transactions/second a
database cluster can handle over a single node.

Postgres-R is another interesting approach which I think should be taken
seriously. Anyone interested can read a paper on this at
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/330257.html

Anyways, my two cents

I would point you to the info on gborg,  but it seems to be down at the

Here is another one from that same group, that addresses  the WAN issues.

FWIW, Sybase Replication Server does just such a thing.  

They have a secondary log marker (prevents the log from truncating past 
the oldest unreplicated transaction).  A thread within the system called 
the "rep agent" (but it use to be a separate process call the LTM), reads 
the log and forwards it to the rep server, once the rep server has the 
whole transaction and it is written to a stable device (aka synced to 
disk) the rep server responds to the LTM telling him it's OK to move the 
log marker forward.

Anyway, once the replication server proper has the transaction it uses a 
publish/subscribe methodology to see who wants get the update.

Bidirectional replication is done by making two oneway replications.  The 
whole thing is table based, it marks the tables as replicated or not in 
the database to save the trip to the repserver on un replicated tables.

Plus you can take parts of a database (replicate all rows where the 
country is "us" to this server and all the rows with "uk" to that server).  
Or opposite you can roll up smaller regional databases to bigger ones, 
it's very flexible.


Cheers,

Brian
