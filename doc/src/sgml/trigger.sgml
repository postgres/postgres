  <title>Triggers</title>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has various server-side function
   interfaces. Server-side functions can be written in SQL, PL/pgSQL,
   Tcl, or C. Trigger functions can be written in any of these
   languages except SQL. Note that statement-level trigger events are not
   supported in the current version. You can currently specify BEFORE or
   AFTER on INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE of a tuple as a trigger event.
  </para>

   <title>Trigger Definition</title>

   <para>
    If a trigger event occurs, the trigger manager (called by the Executor)
    sets up a TriggerData information structure (described below) and calls
    the trigger function to handle the event.
   </para>

   <para>
    The trigger function must be defined before the trigger itself can be
    created.  The trigger function must be declared as a 
    function taking no arguments and returning type <literal>opaque</>.
    (The trigger function receives its input through a TriggerData
    structure, not in the form of ordinary function arguments.)
    If the function is written in C, it must use the <quote>version 1</>
    function manager interface.
   </para>

   <para>
    The syntax for creating triggers is:

    <programlisting>
CREATE TRIGGER <replaceable>trigger</replaceable> [ BEFORE | AFTER ] [ INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE [ OR ... ] ]
    ON <replaceable>relation</replaceable> FOR EACH [ ROW | STATEMENT ]
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE <replaceable>procedure</replaceable>
     (<replaceable>args</replaceable>);
    </programlisting>

    where the arguments are:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       <replaceable>trigger</replaceable>
      </term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The trigger must have a name distinct from all other triggers on
	the same table.  The name is needed
	if you ever have to delete the trigger.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>BEFORE</term>
      <term>AFTER</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Determines whether the function is called before or after
	the event.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>INSERT</term>
      <term>DELETE</term>
      <term>UPDATE</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The next element of the command determines what event(s) will trigger
	the function.  Multiple events can be specified separated by OR.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable>relation</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The relation name indicates which table the event applies to.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>ROW</term>
      <term>STATEMENT</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The FOR EACH clause determines whether the trigger is fired for each
	affected row or before (or after) the entire statement has completed.
	Currently only the ROW case is supported.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable>procedure</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The procedure name is the function to be called.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable>args</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The arguments passed to the function in the TriggerData structure.
	This is either empty or a list of one or more simple literal
	constants (which will be passed to the function as strings).
       </para>

       <para>
	The purpose of including arguments in the trigger definition
	is to allow different
	triggers with similar requirements to call the same function.
	As an example, there could be a generalized trigger
	function that takes as its arguments two field names and puts the
	current user in one and the current timestamp in the other.
	Properly written, this trigger function would be independent of
	the specific table it is triggering on.  So the same function
	could be used for INSERT events on any table with suitable fields,
	to automatically track creation of records in a transaction table for
	example. It could also be used to track last-update events if
	defined as an UPDATE trigger.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Trigger functions return a HeapTuple to the calling Executor.  The return
    value is ignored for triggers fired AFTER an operation,
    but it allows BEFORE triggers to:

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Return NULL to skip the operation for the current tuple (and so the
       tuple will not be inserted/updated/deleted).
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       For INSERT and UPDATE triggers only, the returned tuple becomes the
       tuple which will be inserted or will replace the tuple being updated.
       This allows the trigger function to modify the row being inserted or
       updated.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    A BEFORE trigger that does not intend to cause either of these behaviors
    must be careful to return the same NEW tuple it is passed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that there is no initialization performed by the CREATE TRIGGER
    handler.  This may be changed in the future.
   </para>

   <para>
    If more than one trigger
    is defined for the same event on the same relation, the triggers will
    be fired in alphabetical order by name.  In the case of BEFORE triggers,
    the possibly-modified tuple returned by each trigger becomes the input
    to the next trigger.  If any BEFORE trigger returns NULL, the operation
    is abandoned and subsequent triggers are not fired.
   </para>

   <para>
    If a trigger function executes SQL-queries (using SPI) then these queries
    may fire triggers again. This is known as cascading triggers.  There is no
    direct limitation on the number of cascade levels.  It is possible for
    cascades to cause recursive invocation of the same trigger --- for
    example, an INSERT trigger might execute a query that inserts an
    additional tuple into the same table, causing the INSERT trigger to be
    fired again.  It is the trigger programmer's
    responsibility to avoid infinite recursion in such scenarios.
   </para>

  <sect1 id="trigger-manager">
   <title>Interaction with the Trigger Manager</title>

   <para>
    This section describes the low-level details of the interface to a
    trigger function.  This information is only needed when writing a
    trigger function in C.  If you are using a higher-level function
    language then these details are handled for you.
   </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      The interface described here applies for
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.1 and later.
      Earlier versions passed the TriggerData pointer in a global
      variable CurrentTriggerData.
     </para>
    </note>

   <para>
    When a function is called by the trigger manager, it is not passed any
    normal parameters, but it is passed a <quote>context</> pointer pointing to a
    TriggerData structure.  C functions can check whether they were called
    from the trigger manager or not by executing the macro
    <literal>CALLED_AS_TRIGGER(fcinfo)</literal>, which expands to
    <programlisting>
        ((fcinfo)->context != NULL && IsA((fcinfo)->context, TriggerData))
    </programlisting>
    If this returns TRUE, then it is safe to cast fcinfo->context to type
    <literal>TriggerData *</literal> and make use of the pointed-to
    TriggerData structure.
    The function must <emphasis>not</emphasis> alter the TriggerData
    structure or any of the data it points to.
   </para>

   <para>
    <structname>struct TriggerData</structname> is defined in
    <filename>commands/trigger.h</filename>:

   <title>Visibility of Data Changes</title>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> data changes visibility rule: during a query execution, data
    changes made by the query itself (via SQL-function, SPI-function, triggers)
    are invisible to the query scan.  For example, in query

    <programlisting>
INSERT INTO a SELECT * FROM a;
    </programlisting>

    tuples inserted are invisible for SELECT scan.  In effect, this
    duplicates the database table within itself (subject to unique index
    rules, of course) without recursing.
   </para>

   <para>
    But keep in mind this notice about visibility in the SPI documentation:

    <blockquote>
     <para>
Changes made by query Q are visible by queries that are started after
query Q, no matter whether they are started inside Q (during the
execution of Q) or after Q is done.
     </para>
    </blockquote>
   </para>

   <para>
    This is true for triggers as well so, though a tuple being inserted
    (tg_trigtuple) is not visible to queries in a BEFORE trigger, this tuple
    (just inserted) is visible to queries in an AFTER trigger, and to queries
    in BEFORE/AFTER triggers fired after this!
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="trigger-examples">
   <title>Examples</title>

   <para>
    There are more complex examples in
    <filename>src/test/regress/regress.c</filename> and
    in <filename>contrib/spi</filename>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is a very simple example of trigger usage.  Function trigf reports
    the number of tuples in the triggered relation ttest and skips the
    operation if the query attempts to insert NULL into x (i.e - it acts as a
    NOT NULL constraint but doesn't abort the transaction).
