   <title>Writing A Foreign Data Wrapper</title>

   </indexterm>

   <para>
    All operations on a foreign table are handled through its foreign data
    wrapper, which consists of a set of functions that the core server
    calls.  The foreign data wrapper is responsible for fetching
    data from the remote data source and returning it to the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> executor.  If updating foreign
    tables is to be supported, the wrapper must handle that, too.
    This chapter outlines how to write a new foreign data wrapper.
   </para>

   <para>
    The foreign data wrappers included in the standard distribution are good
    references when trying to write your own.  Look into the
    <filename>contrib</> subdirectory of the source tree.
    The <xref linkend="sql-createforeigndatawrapper"> reference page also has
    some useful details.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The SQL standard specifies an interface for writing foreign data wrappers.
     However, PostgreSQL does not implement that API, because the effort to
     accommodate it into PostgreSQL would be large, and the standard API hasn't
     gained wide adoption anyway.
    </para>

    <title>Foreign Data Wrapper Functions</title>

    <para>
     The FDW author needs to implement a handler function, and optionally
     a validator function. Both functions must be written in a compiled
     language such as C, using the version-1 interface.
     For details on C language calling conventions and dynamic loading,
     see <xref linkend="xfunc-c">.
    </para>

    <para>
     The handler function simply returns a struct of function pointers to
     callback functions that will be called by the planner, executor, and
     various maintenance commands.
     Most of the effort in writing an FDW is in implementing these callback
     functions.
     The handler function must be registered with
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> as taking no arguments and
     returning the special pseudo-type <type>fdw_handler</type>.  The
     callback functions are plain C functions and are not visible or
     callable at the SQL level.  The callback functions are described in
     <xref linkend="fdw-callbacks">.
    </para>

    <para>
     The validator function is responsible for validating options given in
     <command>CREATE</command> and <command>ALTER</command> commands for its
     foreign data wrapper, as well as foreign servers, user mappings, and
     foreign tables using the wrapper.
     The validator function must be registered as taking two arguments, a
     text array containing the options to be validated, and an OID
     representing the type of object the options are associated with (in
     the form of the OID of the system catalog the object would be stored
     in, either
     <literal>ForeignDataWrapperRelationId</>,
     <literal>ForeignServerRelationId</>,
     <literal>UserMappingRelationId</>,
     or <literal>ForeignTableRelationId</>).
     If no validator function is supplied, options are not checked at object
     creation time or object alteration time.

</programlisting>

     Obtain relation size estimates for a foreign table.  This is called
     at the beginning of planning for a query that scans a foreign table.
     <literal>root</> is the planner's global information about the query;
     <literal>baserel</> is the planner's information about this table; and
     <literal>foreigntableid</> is the <structname>pg_class</> OID of the
     foreign table.  (<literal>foreigntableid</> could be obtained from the
     planner data structures, but it's passed explicitly to save effort.)

    <para>
     This function should update <literal>baserel-&gt;rows</> to be the
     expected number of rows returned by the table scan, after accounting for
     the filtering done by the restriction quals.  The initial value of

     the target list to be emitted by the plan node,

<programlisting>
void
BeginForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node,
                  int eflags);
</programlisting>

     Begin executing a foreign scan. This is called during executor startup.
     It should perform any initialization needed before the scan can start,
     but not start executing the actual scan (that should be done upon the
     first call to <function>IterateForeignScan</>).
     The <structname>ForeignScanState</> node has already been created, but
     its <structfield>fdw_state</> field is still NULL.  Information about
     the table to scan is accessible through the
     <structname>ForeignScanState</> node (in particular, from the underlying
     <structname>ForeignScan</> plan node, which contains any FDW-private
     information provided by <function>GetForeignPlan</>).
     <literal>eflags</> contains flag bits describing the executor's
     operating mode for this plan node.
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that when <literal>(eflags &amp; EXEC_FLAG_EXPLAIN_ONLY)</> is
     true, this function should not perform any externally-visible actions;
     it should only do the minimum required to make the node state valid
     for <function>ExplainForeignScan</> and <function>EndForeignScan</>.
    </para>

    <para>
<programlisting>
TupleTableSlot *
IterateForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node);
</programlisting>

     Fetch one row from the foreign source, returning it in a tuple table slot
     (the node's <structfield>ScanTupleSlot</> should be used for this
     purpose).  Return NULL if no more rows are available.  The tuple table
     slot infrastructure allows either a physical or virtual tuple to be
     returned; in most cases the latter choice is preferable from a
     performance standpoint.  Note that this is called in a short-lived memory
     context that will be reset between invocations.  Create a memory context
     in <function>BeginForeignScan</> if you need longer-lived storage, or use
     the <structfield>es_query_cxt</> of the node's <structname>EState</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     The rows returned must match the <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</> target
     list if one was supplied, otherwise they must match the row type of the
     foreign table being scanned.  If you choose to optimize away fetching
     columns that are not needed, you should insert nulls in those column
     positions, or else generate a <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</> list with
     those columns omitted.
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s executor doesn't care
     whether the rows returned violate any constraints that were defined on
     the foreign table &mdash; but the planner does care, and may optimize
     queries incorrectly if there are rows visible in the foreign table that
     do not satisfy a declared constraint.  If a constraint is violated when
     the user has declared that the constraint should hold true, it may be
     appropriate to raise an error (just as you would need to do in the case
     of a data type mismatch).
    </para>

    <para>
<programlisting>
void
ReScanForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node);
</programlisting>

     Restart the scan from the beginning.  Note that any parameters the
     scan depends on may have changed value, so the new scan does not
     necessarily return exactly the same rows.
    </para>

    <para>
<programlisting>
void
EndForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node);
</programlisting>

     End the scan and release resources.  It is normally not important
     to release palloc'd memory, but for example open files and connections
     to remote servers should be cleaned up.

    <title>FDW Routines For Scanning Foreign Joins</title>

    <para>
     If an FDW supports performing foreign joins remotely (rather than
     by fetching both tables' data and doing the join locally), it should
     provide this callback function:
    </para>

    <para>
<programlisting>
void
GetForeignJoinPaths (PlannerInfo *root,
                     RelOptInfo *joinrel,
                     RelOptInfo *outerrel,
                     RelOptInfo *innerrel,
                     JoinType jointype,
                     JoinPathExtraData *extra);
</programlisting>
     Create possible access paths for a join of two (or more) foreign tables
     that all belong to the same foreign server.  This optional
     function is called during query planning.  As
     with <function>GetForeignPaths</>, this function should
     generate <structname>ForeignPath</> path(s) for the
     supplied <literal>joinrel</>, and call <function>add_path</> to add these
     paths to the set of paths considered for the join.  But unlike
     <function>GetForeignPaths</>, it is not necessary that this function
     succeed in creating at least one path, since paths involving local
     joining are always possible.
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that this function will be invoked repeatedly for the same join
     relation, with different combinations of inner and outer relations; it is
     the responsibility of the FDW to minimize duplicated work.
    </para>

    <para>
     If a <structname>ForeignPath</> path is chosen for the join, it will
     represent the entire join process; paths generated for the component
     tables and subsidiary joins will not be used.  Subsequent processing of
     the join path proceeds much as it does for a path scanning a single
     foreign table.  One difference is that the <structfield>scanrelid</> of
     the resulting <structname>ForeignScan</> plan node should be set to zero,
     since there is no single relation that it represents; instead,
     the <structfield>fs_relids</> field of the <structname>ForeignScan</>
     node represents the set of relations that were joined.  (The latter field
     is set up automatically by the core planner code, and need not be filled
     by the FDW.)  Another difference is that, because the column list for a
     remote join cannot be found from the system catalogs, the FDW must
     fill <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</> with an appropriate list
     of <structfield>TargetEntry</> nodes, representing the set of columns
     it will supply at run time in the tuples it returns.

    <title>FDW Routines For Updating Foreign Tables</title>

    <para>
     If an FDW supports writable foreign tables, it should provide
     some or all of the following callback functions depending on
     the needs and capabilities of the FDW:
    </para>

    <para>

                         Relation target_relation);
</programlisting>

     <command>UPDATE</> and <command>DELETE</> operations are performed
     against rows previously fetched by the table-scanning functions.  The
     FDW may need extra information, such as a row ID or the values of
     primary-key columns, to ensure that it can identify the exact row to
     update or delete.  To support that, this function can add extra hidden,
     or <quote>junk</>, target columns to the list of columns that are to be
     retrieved from the foreign table during an <command>UPDATE</> or
     <command>DELETE</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     To do that, add <structname>TargetEntry</> items to
     <literal>parsetree-&gt;targetList</>, containing expressions for the
     extra values to be fetched.  Each such entry must be marked
     <structfield>resjunk</> = <literal>true</>, and must have a distinct
     <structfield>resname</> that will identify it at execution time.
     Avoid using names matching <literal>ctid<replaceable>N</></literal>,
     <literal>wholerow</literal>, or
     <literal>wholerow<replaceable>N</></literal>, as the core system can
     generate junk columns of these names.
    </para>

    <para>
     This function is called in the rewriter, not the planner, so the
     information available is a bit different from that available to the
     planning routines.
     <literal>parsetree</> is the parse tree for the <command>UPDATE</> or
     <command>DELETE</> command, while <literal>target_rte</> and

    </para>

    <para>
     If the <function>AddForeignUpdateTargets</> pointer is set to
     <literal>NULL</>, no extra target expressions are added.
     (This will make it impossible to implement <command>DELETE</>

     Delete one tuple from the foreign table.

     <literal>rinfo</> is the <structname>ResultRelInfo</> struct describing
     the target foreign table.
     <literal>slot</> contains nothing useful upon call, but can be used to
     hold the returned tuple.
     <literal>planSlot</> contains the tuple that was generated by the

     carry any junk columns that were requested by
     <function>AddForeignUpdateTargets</>.  The junk column(s) must be used
     to identify the tuple to be deleted.
    </para>

    <para>
     The return value is either a slot containing the row that was deleted,

     The data in the returned slot is used only if the <command>DELETE</>
     query has a <literal>RETURNING</> clause or the foreign table has
     an <literal>AFTER ROW</> trigger.  Triggers require all columns, but the
     FDW could choose to optimize away returning some or all columns depending
     on the contents of the <literal>RETURNING</> clause.  Regardless, some
     slot must be returned to indicate success, or the query's reported row
     count will be wrong.

     <literal>estate</> is global execution state for the query.
     <literal>erm</> is the <structname>ExecRowMark</> struct describing
     the target foreign table and the row lock type (if any) to acquire.
     <literal>rowid</> identifies the tuple to be fetched.
     <literal>updated</> is an output parameter.

    <para>
     This function should return a palloc'ed copy of the fetched tuple,

bool
RecheckForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node, TupleTableSlot *slot);
</programlisting>
     Recheck that a previously-returned tuple still matches the relevant
     scan and join qualifiers, and possibly provide a modified version of
     the tuple.  For foreign data wrappers which do not perform join pushdown,
     it will typically be more convenient to set this to <literal>NULL</> and
     instead set <structfield>fdw_recheck_quals</structfield> appropriately.
     When outer joins are pushed down, however, it isn't sufficient to
     reapply the checks relevant to all the base tables to the result tuple,
     even if all needed attributes are present, because failure to match some
     qualifier might result in some attributes going to NULL, rather than in
     no tuple being returned.  <literal>RecheckForeignScan</> can recheck
     qualifiers and return true if they are still satisfied and false
     otherwise, but it can also store a replacement tuple into the supplied
     slot.
    </para>

    <para>
     To implement join pushdown, a foreign data wrapper will typically
     construct an alternative local join plan which is used only for
     rechecks; this will become the outer subplan of the
     <literal>ForeignScan</>.  When a recheck is required, this subplan
     can be executed and the resulting tuple can be stored in the slot.
     This plan need not be efficient since no base table will return more
     than one row; for example, it may implement all joins as nested loops.

    <para>
     The information in <literal>root</> and <literal>baserel</> can be used
     to reduce the amount of information that has to be fetched from the

     <literal>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</> is particularly interesting, as
     it contains restriction quals (<literal>WHERE</> clauses) that should be
     used to filter the rows to be fetched.  (The FDW itself is not required
     to enforce these quals, as the core executor can check them instead.)
     <literal>baserel-&gt;reltargetlist</> can be used to determine which
     columns need to be fetched; but note that it only lists columns that
     have to be emitted by the <structname>ForeignScan</> plan node, not
     columns that are used in qual evaluation but not output by the query.
    </para>

    <para>
     Various private fields are available for the FDW planning functions to
     keep information in.  Generally, whatever you store in FDW private fields
     should be palloc'd, so that it will be reclaimed at the end of planning.
    </para>

    <para>
     <literal>baserel-&gt;fdw_private</> is a <type>void</> pointer that is
     available for FDW planning functions to store information relevant to
     the particular foreign table.  The core planner does not touch it except
     to initialize it to NULL when the <literal>RelOptInfo</> node is created.
     It is useful for passing information forward from
     <function>GetForeignRelSize</> to <function>GetForeignPaths</> and/or
     <function>GetForeignPaths</> to <function>GetForeignPlan</>, thereby
     avoiding recalculation.
    </para>

    <para>
     <function>GetForeignPaths</> can identify the meaning of different
     access paths by storing private information in the
     <structfield>fdw_private</> field of <structname>ForeignPath</> nodes.
     <structfield>fdw_private</> is declared as a <type>List</> pointer, but
     could actually contain anything since the core planner does not touch
     it.  However, best practice is to use a representation that's dumpable
     by <function>nodeToString</>, for use with debugging support available
     in the backend.
    </para>

    <para>
     <function>GetForeignPlan</> can examine the <structfield>fdw_private</>
     field of the selected <structname>ForeignPath</> node, and can generate
     <structfield>fdw_exprs</> and <structfield>fdw_private</> lists to be
     placed in the <structname>ForeignScan</> plan node, where they will be
     available at execution time.  Both of these lists must be
     represented in a form that <function>copyObject</> knows how to copy.
     The <structfield>fdw_private</> list has no other restrictions and is
     not interpreted by the core backend in any way.  The
     <structfield>fdw_exprs</> list, if not NIL, is expected to contain
     expression trees that are intended to be executed at run time.  These
     trees will undergo post-processing by the planner to make them fully
     executable.
    </para>

    <para>
     In <function>GetForeignPlan</>, generally the passed-in target list can
     be copied into the plan node as-is.  The passed <literal>scan_clauses</> list
     contains the same clauses as <literal>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</>,
     but may be re-ordered for better execution efficiency.  In simple cases
     the FDW can just strip <structname>RestrictInfo</> nodes from the
     <literal>scan_clauses</> list (using <function>extract_actual_clauses</>) and put
     all the clauses into the plan node's qual list, which means that all the
     clauses will be checked by the executor at run time.  More complex FDWs
     may be able to check some of the clauses internally, in which case those
     clauses can be removed from the plan node's qual list so that the
     executor doesn't waste time rechecking them.
    </para>

    <para>
     As an example, the FDW might identify some restriction clauses of the
     form <replaceable>foreign_variable</> <literal>=</>
     <replaceable>sub_expression</>, which it determines can be executed on
     the remote server given the locally-evaluated value of the
     <replaceable>sub_expression</>.  The actual identification of such a
     clause should happen during <function>GetForeignPaths</>, since it would
     affect the cost estimate for the path.  The path's
     <structfield>fdw_private</> field would probably include a pointer to
     the identified clause's <structname>RestrictInfo</> node.  Then
     <function>GetForeignPlan</> would remove that clause from <literal>scan_clauses</>,
     but add the <replaceable>sub_expression</> to <structfield>fdw_exprs</>
     to ensure that it gets massaged into executable form.  It would probably
     also put control information into the plan node's
     <structfield>fdw_private</> field to tell the execution functions what
     to do at run time.  The query transmitted to the remote server would
     involve something like <literal>WHERE <replaceable>foreign_variable</> =
     $1</literal>, with the parameter value obtained at run time from
     evaluation of the <structfield>fdw_exprs</> expression tree.
    </para>

    <para>
     Any clauses removed from the plan node's qual list must instead be added
     to <literal>fdw_recheck_quals</> or rechecked by
     <literal>RecheckForeignScan</> in order to ensure correct behavior
     at the <literal>READ COMMITTED</> isolation level.  When a concurrent
     update occurs for some other table involved in the query, the executor
     may need to verify that all of the original quals are still satisfied for
     the tuple, possibly against a different set of parameter values.  Using
     <literal>fdw_recheck_quals</> is typically easier than implementing checks
     inside <literal>RecheckForeignScan</>, but this method will be
     insufficient when outer joins have been pushed down, since the join tuples
     in that case might have some fields go to NULL without rejecting the
     tuple entirely.
    </para>

    <para>
     Another <structname>ForeignScan</> field that can be filled by FDWs
     is <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</>, which describes the tuples returned by
     the FDW for this plan node.  For simple foreign table scans this can be
     set to <literal>NIL</>, implying that the returned tuples have the
     row type declared for the foreign table.  A non-<symbol>NIL</symbol> value must be a
     target list (list of <structname>TargetEntry</>s) containing Vars and/or
     expressions representing the returned columns.  This might be used, for
     example, to show that the FDW has omitted some columns that it noticed
     won't be needed for the query.  Also, if the FDW can compute expressions
     used by the query more cheaply than can be done locally, it could add
     those expressions to <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</>.  Note that join
     plans (created from paths made by <function>GetForeignJoinPaths</>) must
     always supply <structfield>fdw_scan_tlist</> to describe the set of
     columns they will return.
    </para>

    <para>
     The FDW should always construct at least one path that depends only on
     the table's restriction clauses.  In join queries, it might also choose
     to construct path(s) that depend on join clauses, for example
     <replaceable>foreign_variable</> <literal>=</>
     <replaceable>local_variable</>.  Such clauses will not be found in
     <literal>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</> but must be sought in the
     relation's join lists.  A path using such a clause is called a
     <quote>parameterized path</>.  It must identify the other relations
     used in the selected join clause(s) with a suitable value of
     <literal>param_info</>; use <function>get_baserel_parampathinfo</>
     to compute that value.  In <function>GetForeignPlan</>, the
     <replaceable>local_variable</> portion of the join clause would be added
     to <structfield>fdw_exprs</>, and then at run time the case works the
     same as for an ordinary restriction clause.
    </para>

    <para>
     If an FDW supports remote joins, <function>GetForeignJoinPaths</> should
     produce <structname>ForeignPath</>s for potential remote joins in much
     the same way as <function>GetForeignPaths</> works for base tables.
     Information about the intended join can be passed forward
     to <function>GetForeignPlan</> in the same ways described above.
     However, <structfield>baserestrictinfo</> is not relevant for join
     relations; instead, the relevant join clauses for a particular join are
     passed to <function>GetForeignJoinPaths</> as a separate parameter
     (<literal>extra-&gt;restrictlist</>).
    </para>

    <para>
     When planning an <command>UPDATE</> or <command>DELETE</>,
     <function>PlanForeignModify</> can look up the <structname>RelOptInfo</>
     struct for the foreign table and make use of the
     <literal>baserel-&gt;fdw_private</> data previously created by the
     scan-planning functions.  However, in <command>INSERT</> the target
     table is not scanned so there is no <structname>RelOptInfo</> for it.
     The <structname>List</> returned by <function>PlanForeignModify</> has
     the same restrictions as the <structfield>fdw_private</> list of a
     <structname>ForeignScan</> plan node, that is it must contain only
     structures that <function>copyObject</> knows how to copy.
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>INSERT</> with an <literal>ON CONFLICT</> clause does not
     support specifying the conflict target, as unique constraints or
     exclusion constraints on remote tables are not locally known. This
     in turn implies that <literal>ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE</> is not supported,
     since the specification is mandatory there.

    <title>Row Locking in Foreign Data Wrappers</title>

    <para>
     If an FDW's underlying storage mechanism has a concept of locking
     individual rows to prevent concurrent updates of those rows, it is
     usually worthwhile for the FDW to perform row-level locking with as
     close an approximation as practical to the semantics used in
     ordinary <productname>PostgreSQL</> tables.  There are multiple
     considerations involved in this.
    </para>

    <para>
     One key decision to be made is whether to perform <firstterm>early
     locking</> or <firstterm>late locking</>.  In early locking, a row is
     locked when it is first retrieved from the underlying store, while in
     late locking, the row is locked only when it is known that it needs to
     be locked.  (The difference arises because some rows may be discarded by
     locally-checked restriction or join conditions.)  Early locking is much
     simpler and avoids extra round trips to a remote store, but it can cause
     locking of rows that need not have been locked, resulting in reduced
     concurrency or even unexpected deadlocks.  Also, late locking is only
     possible if the row to be locked can be uniquely re-identified later.
     Preferably the row identifier should identify a specific version of the
     row, as <productname>PostgreSQL</> TIDs do.
    </para>

    <para>
     By default, <productname>PostgreSQL</> ignores locking considerations
     when interfacing to FDWs, but an FDW can perform early locking without
     any explicit support from the core code.  The API functions described
     in <xref linkend="fdw-callbacks-row-locking">, which were added
     in <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5, allow an FDW to use late locking if
     it wishes.
    </para>

    <para>
     An additional consideration is that in <literal>READ COMMITTED</>
     isolation mode, <productname>PostgreSQL</> may need to re-check
     restriction and join conditions against an updated version of some
     target tuple.  Rechecking join conditions requires re-obtaining copies
     of the non-target rows that were previously joined to the target tuple.
     When working with standard <productname>PostgreSQL</> tables, this is
     done by including the TIDs of the non-target tables in the column list
     projected through the join, and then re-fetching non-target rows when
     required.  This approach keeps the join data set compact, but it
     requires inexpensive re-fetch capability, as well as a TID that can
     uniquely identify the row version to be re-fetched.  By default,
     therefore, the approach used with foreign tables is to include a copy of
     the entire row fetched from a foreign table in the column list projected
     through the join.  This puts no special demands on the FDW but can
     result in reduced performance of merge and hash joins.  An FDW that is
     capable of meeting the re-fetch requirements can choose to do it the
     first way.
    </para>

    <para>
     For an <command>UPDATE</> or <command>DELETE</> on a foreign table, it
     is recommended that the <literal>ForeignScan</> operation on the target
     table perform early locking on the rows that it fetches, perhaps via the
     equivalent of <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</>.  An FDW can detect whether
     a table is an <command>UPDATE</>/<command>DELETE</> target at plan time
     by comparing its relid to <literal>root-&gt;parse-&gt;resultRelation</>,
     or at execution time by using <function>ExecRelationIsTargetRelation()</>.
     An alternative possibility is to perform late locking within the
     <function>ExecForeignUpdate</> or <function>ExecForeignDelete</>
     callback, but no special support is provided for this.
    </para>

    <para>
     For foreign tables that are specified to be locked by a <command>SELECT
     FOR UPDATE/SHARE</> command, the <literal>ForeignScan</> operation can
     again perform early locking by fetching tuples with the equivalent
     of <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE</>.  To perform late locking
     instead, provide the callback functions defined
     in <xref linkend="fdw-callbacks-row-locking">.
     In <function>GetForeignRowMarkType</>, select rowmark option
     <literal>ROW_MARK_EXCLUSIVE</>, <literal>ROW_MARK_NOKEYEXCLUSIVE</>,
     <literal>ROW_MARK_SHARE</>, or <literal>ROW_MARK_KEYSHARE</> depending
     on the requested lock strength.  (The core code will act the same
     regardless of which of these four options you choose.)
     Elsewhere, you can detect whether a foreign table was specified to be
     locked by this type of command by using <function>get_plan_rowmark</> at
     plan time, or <function>ExecFindRowMark</> at execution time; you must
     check not only whether a non-null rowmark struct is returned, but that
     its <structfield>strength</> field is not <literal>LCS_NONE</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Lastly, for foreign tables that are used in an <command>UPDATE</>,
     <command>DELETE</> or <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE</> command but
     are not specified to be row-locked, you can override the default choice
     to copy entire rows by having <function>GetForeignRowMarkType</> select
     option <literal>ROW_MARK_REFERENCE</> when it sees lock strength
     <literal>LCS_NONE</>.  This will cause <function>RefetchForeignRow</> to
     be called with that value for <structfield>markType</>; it should then
     re-fetch the row without acquiring any new lock.  (If you have
     a <function>GetForeignRowMarkType</> function but don't wish to re-fetch
     unlocked rows, select option <literal>ROW_MARK_COPY</>
     for <literal>LCS_NONE</>.)
