MSG000001.bin is a binary file, result of Microsoft MC compiler. MC compiler
can be downloaded for free with MS Core SDK but it is not included with MSYS
tools and I didn't find an alternative way to compile MC file.

To summarize: the command "MC pgmsgevent.mc" generates pgmsgevent.h,
pgmsgevent.rc, and MSG00001.bin files.  In MC file, we declare a string
with %s format, so we can write anything we want in the future without
needing to change the definition of this string.

To finish, because DllUnregisterServer and DllRegisterServer are system
defined entry points, we need to export these two functions with their names
without "decoration", so we cannot use auto generated .def files without
handy modifications.
