<Chapter Id="runtime">
 <Title>Server Runtime Environment</Title>

 <Para>
  This chapter discusses how to set up and run the database server
  and the interactions with the operating system.
 </para>

 <sect1 id="postgres-user">
  <title>The Postgres user account</title>

  <para>
   As with any other server daemon that is connected to the world at
   large, it is advisable to run Postgres under a separate user
   account. This user account should only own the data itself that is
   being managed by the server, and should not be shared with other
   daemons. (Thus, using the user <quote>nobody</quote> is a bad
   idea.) It is not advisable to install the executables as owned by
   this user account because that runs the risk of user-defined
   functions gone astray or any other exploits compromising the
   executable programs.
  </para>

  <para>
   To add a user account to your system, look for a command
   <command>useradd</command> or <command>adduser</command>. The user
   name <quote>postgres</quote> is often used but by no means
   required.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="creating-cluster">
  <title>Creating a database cluster</title>

  <para>
   Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage
   area on disk. We call this a <firstterm>database
   cluster</firstterm>. (<acronym>SQL</acronym> speaks of a catalog
   cluster instead.) A database cluster is a collection of databases
   that will be accessible through a single instance of a running
   database server. After initialization, a database cluster will
   contain one database named <literal>template1</literal>. As the
   name suggests, this will be used as a template for any subsequently
   created database; it should not be used for actual work.
  </para>

  <para>
   In file system terms, a database cluster will be a single directory
   under which all data will be stored. We call this the
   <firstterm>data directory</firstterm> or <firstterm>data
   area</firstterm>. It is completely up to you where you choose to
   store your data, there is no default, although locations such as
   <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</filename> or
   <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename> are popular. To initialize
   a database cluster, use the command <command>initdb</command>,
   which is installed with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. The
   desired file system location of your database system is indicated
   by the <option>-D</option> option, for example
<screen>
&gt; <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   Note that you must execute this command while being logged in to
   the Postgres user account, which is described in the previous
   section.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    As an alternative to the <option>-D</option> option, you can set
    the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will attempt to create the directory you
   specify if it does not already exist. It is likely that it won't
   have the permission to do so (if you followed our advice and
   created an unprivileged account). In that case you can create the
   directory yourself (as root) and transfer ownership of it or grant
   write access to it. Here is how this might work:
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>su postgres</userinput>
postgres&gt; <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will refuse to run if the data directory
   looks like it belongs to an already initialized installation.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because the data directory contains all the data stored in the
   database it is essential that it be well secured from unauthorized
   access. <command>initdb</command> therefore revokes access
   permissions from everyone but the Postgres user account.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="postmaster-start">
  <title>Starting the database server</title>

  <para>
   Before anyone can access the database you must start the database
   server. The database server is called
   <firstterm>postmaster</firstterm>.
   The postmaster must know where to find the data it is supposed
   to work on. This is done with the <option>-D</option> option. Thus,
   the simplest way to start the server is, for example,
<screen>
&gt; <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must
   again be done while logged in to the Postgres user account. Without
   a <option>-D</option>, the server will try to use the data
   directory in the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>; if
   neither of these works it will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   To start the <application>postmaster</application> in the
   background, use the usual shell syntax:
<screen>
&gt; <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt; logfile 1&gt;&amp;2 &amp;</userinput>
</screen>
   It is an extremely good idea to keep the server output around
   somewhere, as indicated here. It will help both for auditing
   purposes and to diagnose problems.
  </para>

  <para>
   The postmaster also takes a number of other command line options.
   For more information see the reference page and below under runtime
   configuration. In particular, in order for the postmaster to accept
   TCP/IP connections (rather than just Unix domain socket ones), you
   must also specify the <option>-i</option> option.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots up. This is not required; the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server can be run
   successfully from non-privileged accounts without root
   intervention.
  </para>

  <para>
   Different systems have different conventions for starting up
   daemons at boot time, so you are advised to familiarize yourself
   with them. Many systems have a file
   <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename> which is almost certainly
   no bad place to put such a command. Whatever you do, postmaster
   must be run by the <productname>Postgres</productname> user account
   <emphasis>and not by root</emphasis> or any other user. Therefore
   you probably always want to form your command lines along the lines
   of <literal>su -c '...' postgres</literal>, for example:
<programlisting>
nohup su -c 'postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data > server.log 2>&1' postgres &
</programlisting>
   (using the program <application>nohup</application> to prevent the
   server from dying when you log out).
  </para>

  <para>
   Here are a few more operating system specific suggestions.

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Edit the file <filename>rc.local</filename> on
      <productname>NetBSD</productname> or file
      <filename>rc2.d</filename> on <productname>Solaris</productname> to contain the
      following single line:
<programlisting>
su postgres -c "/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data"
</programlisting>
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      On <productname>FreeBSD</productname> edit
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/pgsql.sh</filename> to contain the
      following lines and make it <literal>chmod 755</literal> and
      <literal>chown root:bin</literal>.
<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
[ -x /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster ] && {
    su -l pgsql -c 'exec /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster
        -D/usr/local/pgsql/data
        -S -o -F > /usr/local/pgsql/errlog' &
    echo -n ' pgsql'
}
</programlisting>
      You may put the line breaks as shown above. The shell is smart
      enough to keep parsing beyond end-of-line if there is an
      expression unfinished. The exec saves one layer of shell under
      the postmaster process so the parent is init.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      On <productname>RedHat Linux</productname> add a file
      <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres.init</filename> 
       which is based on the example in <filename>contrib/linux/</filename>.
       Then make a softlink to this file from
       <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S98postgres.init</filename>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    While the <application>postmaster</application> is running, it's
    PID is in the file <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data
    directory. This is used as in interlock against multiple running
    postmaster on the same data directory and can also be used for
    shutting down the postmaster.
   </para>

   <para>
    The shell script wrapper <application>pg_ctl</application> that
    comes with <productname>Postgres</productname> can also be used to
    control starting (and stopping!) of the database server in
    intelligent fashion.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="postmaster-start-failures">
    <title>Server Startup Failures</title>

    <para>
     There are several common reasons for the postmaster to fail to
     start up. Check the postmaster's log file, or start it by hand
     (without redirecting standard output or standard error) to see
     what complaint messages appear. Some of the possible error
     messages are reasonably self-explanatory, but here are some that
     are not.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
FATAL: StreamServerPort: bind() failed: Address already in use
        Is another postmaster already running on that port?
</screen>
     This usually means just what it suggests: you accidentally
     started a second postmaster on the same port where one is already
     running. However, if the kernel error message is not
     <computeroutput>Address already in use</computeroutput> or some
     variant of that wording, there may be a different problem. For
     example, trying to start a postmaster on a reserved port number
     may draw something like
<screen>
&gt; <userinput>postmaster -i -p 666</userinput>
FATAL: StreamServerPort: bind() failed: Permission denied
        Is another postmaster already running on that port?
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     A message like
<screen>
IpcMemoryCreate: shmget(5440001, 83918612, 01600) failed: Invalid argument
FATAL 1:  ShmemCreate: cannot create region
</screen>
     probably means that your kernel's limit on the size of shared
     memory areas is smaller than the buffer area that Postgres is
     trying to create (83918612 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you don't have SysV-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround,
     you can try starting the postmaster with a smaller-than-normal
     number of buffers (<option>-B</option> switch). You will
     eventually want to reconfigure your kernel to increase the
     allowed shared memory size, however. You may see this message
     when trying to start multiple postmasters on the same machine, if
     their total space requests exceed the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     An error like
<screen>
IpcSemaphoreCreate: semget(5440026, 16, 0600) failed: No space left on device
</screen>
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that you've run out of disk
     space; it means that your kernel's limit on the number of SysV
     semaphores is smaller than the number
     <productname>Postgres</productname> wants to create. As above,
     you may be able to work around the problem by starting the
     postmaster with a reduced number of backend processes
     (<option>-N</option> switch), but you'll eventually want to
     increase the kernel limit.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="client-connection-problems">
    <title>Client Connection Problems</title>

    <para>
     Although the possible error conditions on the client side are
     both virtually infinite and application dependent, a few of them
     might be directly related to how the server was started up.
     Conditions other than those shown below should be documented with
     the respective client application.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
connectDB() -- connect() failed: Connection refused
Is the postmaster running (with -i) at 'server.joe.com' and accepting connections on TCP/IP port '5432'?
</screen>
     This is the generic <quote>I couldn't find a server to talk
     to</quote> failure. It looks like the above when TCP/IP
     communication is attempted. A common mistake is to forget the
     <option>-i</option> to the postmaster to allow TCP/IP
     connections.
    </para>

    <para>
     Alternatively, you'll get this when attempting
     Unix-socket communication to a local postmaster:
<screen>
connectDB() -- connect() failed: No such file or directory
Is the postmaster running at 'localhost' and accepting connections on Unix socket '5432'?
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to
     connect where it is supposed to. If there is in fact no
     postmaster running there, the kernel error message will typically
     be either <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> or
     <computeroutput>No such file or directory</computeroutput>, as
     illustrated. (It is particularly important to realize that
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> in this
     context does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that the postmaster
     got your connection request and rejected it -- that case will
     produce a different message, as shown in <xref
     linkend="client-authentication-problems">.) Other error messages
     such as <computeroutput>Connection timed out</computeroutput> may
     indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network
     connectivity.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 Id="runtime-config">
   <Title>Run-time configuration</Title>

   <para>
    There are a lot of configuration parameters that affect the
    behavior of the database system in some way or other. Here we
    describe how to set them and the following subsections will
    discuss each of them.
   </para>

   <para>
    All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
    value of one of the four types boolean, integer, floating point,
    string as described below. Boolean values are
    <literal>ON</literal>, <literal>OFF</literal>,
    <literal>TRUE</literal>, <literal>FALSE</literal>,
    <literal>YES</literal>, <literal>NO</literal>,
    <literal>1</literal>, <literal>0</literal> (case-insensitive) or
    any non-ambiguous prefix of these.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to set these options is to create a file
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> in the data directory (e.g.,
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</filename>). An example of how
    this file could look like is this:
<programlisting>
# This is a comment
log_connections = yes
syslog = 2
</programlisting>
    As you see, options are one per line. The equal sign between name
    and value is optional. White space is insignificant, blank lines
    are ignored. Hash marks (<quote>#</quote>) introduce comments
    anywhere.
   </para>

   <para>
    The configuration file is reread whenever the postmaster receives
    a SIGHUP signal. This signal is also propagated to all running
    backend processes, so that running sessions get the new default.
    Alternatively, you can send the signal to only one backend process
    directly.
   </para>

   <para>
    A second way to set these configuration parameters is to give them
    as a command line option to the postmaster, such as
<programlisting>
postmaster --log-connections=yes --syslog=2
</programlisting>
    which would have the same effect as the previous example.
   </para>

   <para>
    Occasionally it is also useful to give a command line option to
    one particular backend session only. The environment variable
    <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> can be used for this purpose on the
    client side:
<programlisting>
env PGOPTIONS='--geqo=off' psql
</programlisting>
    (This works for any client application, not just
    <application>psql</application>.) Note that this won't work for
    options that are necessarily fixed once the server is started,
    such as the port number.
   </para>

   <para>
    Finally, some options can be changed in individual SQL sessions
    with the <command>SET</command> command, for example
<screen>
=&gt; <userinput>SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;</userinput>
</screen>
    See the SQL command language reference for details on the syntax.

        Various tuning parameters for the genetic query optimization
        algorithm: The pool size is the number of individuals in one
        population. Valid values are between 128 and 1024. If it is
        set to 0 (the default) a pool size of 2^(QS+1), where QS
        is the number of relations in the query, is taken. The effort
        is used to calculate a default for generations. Valid values
        are between 1 and 80, 40 being the default. Generations
        specifies the number of iterations in the algorithm. The
        number must be a positive integer. If 0 is specified then
        Effort * Log2(PoolSize) is used. The run time of the algorithm
        is roughly proportional to the sum of pool size and
        generations. The selection bias is the selective pressure
        within the population. Values can be from 1.50 to 2.00; the
        latter is the default. The random seed can be set to get
        reproduceable results from the algorithm. If it is set to -1
        then the algorithm behaves non-deterministically.

        (such as <literal>WHERE (a=1 AND b=2) OR (a=2 AND b=3)
        ...</literal>) into a UNION query. This method can be faster
        than the default implementation, but it doesn't necessarily
        give exactly the same results, since UNION implicitly adds a
        SELECT DISTINCT clause to eliminate identical output rows.
        KSQO is commonly used when working with products like
        <productname>Microsoft Access</productname>, which tend to
        generate queries of this form.

       <para>
        The KSQO algorithm used to be absolutely essential for queries
        with many OR'ed AND clauses, but in
        <productname>Postgres</productname> 7.0 and later the standard
        planner handles these queries fairly successfully. Hence the
        default is OFF.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        If this is option is on, the <productname>Postgres</> backend
        will use the <function>fsync()</> system call in several
        places to make sure that updates are physically written to
        disk and will not hang around in the write caches. This
        increases the chance that a database installation will still
        be usable after a operating system or hardware crashes by a
        large amount. (Crashes of the database server itself do
        <emphasis>not</> affect this consideration.)
       </para>

       <para>
        However, this operation severely slows down
        <productname>Postgres</>, because at all those points it has
        to block and wait for the operating system to flush the
        buffers. Without <function>fsync</>, the operating system is
        allowed to do its best in buffering, sorting, and delaying
        writes, so this can be a <emphasis>very</> big perfomance
        increase. However, if the system crashes, parts of the data of
        a transaction that has already been committed -- according to
        the information on disk -- will still hang around in memory.
        Inconsistent data (i.e., data corruption) is therefore likely
        to occur.
       </para>

       <para>
        This option is the subject of an eternal debate in the
        <productname>Postgres</> user and developer communities. Some
        always leave it off, some turn it off only for bulk loads,
        where there is a clear restart point if something goes wrong,
        some leave it on just to be on the safe side. Because it is
        the safe side, on is also the default. If you trust your

  <para>
   While doing a project for a company in Moscow, Russia, I
   encountered the problem that <productname>Postgres</> had no
   support of national alphabets. After looking for possible
   workarounds I decided to develop support of locale myself. I'm not
   a C programmer but already had some experience with locale
   programming when I work with <productname>Perl</> (debugging) and
   <productname>Glimpse</>. After several days of digging through the
   <productname>Postgres</> source tree I made very minor corections
   to <filename>src/backend/utils/adt/varlena.c</> and
   <filename>src/backend/main/main.c</> and got what I needed! I did
   support only for <envar>LC_CTYPE</envar> and
   <envar>LC_COLLATE</envar>, but later <envar>LC_MONETARY</envar> was
   added by others. I got many messages from people about this patch
   so I decided to send it to developers and (to my surprise) it was
   incorporated into the <productname>Postgres</> distribution.
  </para>

  <para>
   People often complain that locale doesn't work for them. There are
   several common mistakes:
   
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Didn't properly configure <productname>Postgres</> before
      compilation. You must run <filename>configure</> with the

     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Didn't setup environment correctly when starting postmaster. You
      must define environment variables <envar>LC_CTYPE</envar> and
      <envar>LC_COLLATE</envar> before running postmaster because
      backend gets information about locale from environment. I use
      following shell script:
<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh

export LC_CTYPE=koi8-r
export LC_COLLATE=koi8-r
postmaster -B 1024 -S -D/usr/local/pgsql/data/ -o '-Fe'

       This is the <firstterm>Immediate Shutdown</firstterm> which
       will cause the postmaster to send a SIGUSR1 to all backends and
       exit immediately (without properly shutting down the database
       system). When WAL is implemented, this will lead to recovery on
       startup. Right now it's not recommendable to use this option.

   <caution>
    <para>
     If at all possible, do not use SIGKILL to shut down the
     postmaster. This can cause data corruption and will prevent the
     cleaning up of shared memory resources, which you will have to
     do yourself in that case.
    </para>
   </caution>

   The PID of the postmaster process can be found using the
   <application>ps</application> program, or from the file
   <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. So for
   example, to do a fast shutdown:
<screen>
&gt; <userinput>kill -INT `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   The program <application>pg_ctl</application> is a shell script
   wrapper that provides a convenient interface to these functions.

  <para>
   One can use <productname>ssh</productname> to encrypt the network
   connection between clients and a
   <productname>Postgres</productname> server. Done properly, this
   should lead to an adequately secure network connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   First make sure that an <productname>ssh</productname> server is
   running properly on the same machine as
   <productname>Postgres</productname> and that you can log in using
   ssh as some user. Then you can establish a secure tunnel with a
   command like this from the client machine:
<programlisting>
&gt; <userinput>ssh -L 3333:foo.com:5432 joe@foo.com</userinput>
</programlisting>
   The first number in the <option>-L</option> argument, 3333, is the
   port number of your end of the tunnel; it can be chosen freely. The
   second number, 5432, is the remote end of the tunnel -- the port
   number your backend is using. The name or the address in between
   the port numbers is the host with the database server you are going
   to connect to. In order to connect to the database server using
   this tunnel, you connect to port 3333 on the local machine:
<programlisting>
psql -h localhost -p 3333 template1
</programlisting>
   To the database server it will then look as though you are really
   user <literal>joe@foo.com</literal> and it will use whatever
   authentication procedure was set up for this user. In order for the
   tunnel setup to succeed you must be allowed to connect via ssh as
   joe@foo.com, just as if you had attempted to use ssh to set up a
   terminal session.
