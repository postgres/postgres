<Chapter Id="runtime">
 <Title>Server Run-time Environment</Title>

 <Para>
  This chapter discusses how to set up and run the database server
  and the interactions with the operating system.

  <title>The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> User Account</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>postgres user</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   As with any other server daemon that is connected to outside world,
   it is advisable to run <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> under a
   separate user account. This user account should only own the data
   that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other
   daemons. (For example, using the user <literal>nobody</literal> is a bad
   idea.) It is not advisable to install executables owned by
   this user because compromised systems could then modify their own 
   binaries.
  </para>

  <para>
   To add a Unix user account to your system, look for a command
   <command>useradd</command> or <command>adduser</command>. The user
   name <systemitem>postgres</systemitem> is often used but is by no
   means required.

  <title>Creating a Database Cluster</title>

   <primary>database cluster</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>data area</primary>
   <see>database cluster</see>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage
   area on disk. We call this a <firstterm>database cluster</firstterm>.
   (<acronym>SQL</acronym> uses the term catalog cluster instead.) A
   database cluster is a collection of databases is accessible by a
   single instance of a running database server. After initialization, a
   database cluster will contain a database named
   <literal>template1</literal>. As the name suggests, this will be used
   as a template for subsequently created databases; it should not be
   used for actual work.  (See <xref linkend="managing-databases"> for information
   about creating databases.)
  </para>

  <para>
   In file system terms, a database cluster will be a single directory
   under which all data will be stored. We call this the <firstterm>data
   directory</firstterm> or <firstterm>data area</firstterm>. It is
   completely up to you where you choose to store your data.  There is no
   default, although locations such as
   <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</filename> or
   <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename> are popular. To initialize a
   database cluster, use the command <command>initdb</command>,<indexterm><primary>initdb</></> which is
   installed with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. The desired
   file system location of your database system is indicated by the
   <option>-D</option> option, for example
<screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   Note that you must execute this command while logged into the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account, which is
   described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    As an alternative to the <option>-D</option> option, you can set
    the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
    <indexterm><primary><envar>PGDATA</envar></primary></indexterm>
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will attempt to create the directory you
   specify if it does not already exist. It is likely that it will not
   have the permission to do so (if you followed our advice and created
   an unprivileged account). In that case you should create the
   directory yourself (as root) and change the owner to be the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user. Here is how this might
   be done:
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
root# <userinput>su postgres</userinput>
postgres$ <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will refuse to run if the data directory
   looks like it it has already been initialized.</para>

  <para>
   Because the data directory contains all the data stored in the
   database, it is essential that it be secured from unauthorized
   access. <command>initdb</command> therefore revokes access
   permissions from everyone but the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user.
  </para>

  <para>
   However, while the directory contents are secure, the default
   client authentication setup allows any local user to connect to the
   database and even become the database superuser. If you do not
   trust other local users, we recommend you use
   <command>initdb</command>'s <option>-W</option> or
   <option>--pwprompt</option> option to assign a password to the
   database superuser.<indexterm><primary>password</><secondary>of the
   superuser</></indexterm> After <command>initdb</command>, modify
   the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file to use <literal>md5</> or
   <literal>password</> instead of <literal>trust</> authentication
   <emphasis>before</> you start the server for the first time. (Other
   approaches include using <literal>ident</literal> authentication or
   file system permissions to restrict connections. See <xref
   linkend="client-authentication"> for more information.)
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> also initializes the default
   locale<indexterm><primary>locale</></> for the database cluster.
   Normally, it will just take the locale settings in the environment
   and apply them to the initialized database.  It is possible to
   specify a different locale for the database; more information about
   that can be found in <xref linkend="locale">.  The sort order used
   within a particular database cluster is set by
   <command>initdb</command> and cannot be changed later, short of
   dumping all data, rerunning <command>initdb</command>, and
   reloading the data. So it's important to make this choice correctly
   the first time.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="postmaster-start">
  <title>Starting the Database Server</title>

  <para>
   Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database
   server. The database server program is called
   <command>postmaster</command>.<indexterm><primary>postmaster</></>
   The <command>postmaster</command> must know where to
   find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the
   <option>-D</option> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the
   server is:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be
   done while logged into the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user
   account. Without <option>-D</option>, the server will try to use
   the data directory in the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
   If neither of these succeed, it will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   To start the <command>postmaster</command> in the
   background, use the usual shell syntax:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</userinput>
</screen>
   It is an important to store the server's <systemitem>stdout</> and
   <systemitem>stderr</> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help
   for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <xref
   linkend="logfile-maintenance"> for a more thorough discussion of log
   file handling.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The <command>postmaster</command> also takes a number of other
   command line options. For more information, see the reference page
   and <xref linkend="runtime-config"> below. In particular, in order
   for the server to accept
   TCP/IP<indexterm><primary>TCP/IP</primary></indexterm> connections
   (rather than just Unix-domain socket ones), you must specify the
   <option>-i</option> option.
  </para>

  <para>
   This shell syntax can get tedious quickly.  Therefore the shell
   script wrapper
   <command>pg_ctl</command><indexterm><primary>pg_ctl</primary></indexterm>
   is provided to simplify some tasks.  For example:
<programlisting>
pg_ctl start -l logfile
</programlisting>
   will start the server in the background and put the output into the
   named log file. The <option>-D</option> option has the same meaning
   here as in the <command>postmaster</command>. <command>pg_ctl</command> is also
   capable of stopping the server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots.<indexterm><primary>booting</><secondary>starting
   the server during</></> Autostart scripts are operating
   system-specific.  There are a few distributed with
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> in the
   <filename>contrib/start-scripts</> directory. This may require root
   privileges.
  </para>

  <para>
   Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons
   at boot time. Many systems have a file
   <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>. Others use
   <filename>rc.d</> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be
   run by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account
   <emphasis>and not by root</emphasis> or any other user. Therefore you
   probably should form your commands using <literal>su -c '...'
   postgres</literal>.  For example:
<programlisting>
su -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog' postgres
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Here are a few more operating system specific suggestions. (Always
   replace these with the proper installation directory and the user
   name.)

     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

  </para>

   <para>
    While the <command>postmaster</command> is running, its
    <acronym>PID</acronym> is stored in the file
    <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. This is
    used to prevent multiple <command>postmaster</command> processes
    running in the same data directory and can also be used for
    shutting down the <command>postmaster</command> process.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="postmaster-start-failures">
    <title>Server Start-up Failures</title>

    <para>
     There are several common reasons the server might fail to
     start. Check the server's log file, or start it by hand (without
     redirecting standard output or standard error) and see what error
     messages appear. Below we explain some of the most common error
     messages in more detail.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
     This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start
     another <command>postmaster</command> on the same port where one is already running.
     However, if the kernel error message is not <computeroutput>Address
     already in use</computeroutput> or some variant of that, there may
     be a different problem. For example, trying to start a <command>postmaster</command>
     on a reserved port number may draw something like:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postmaster -i -p 666</userinput>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Permission denied
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 666? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     A message like
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument
DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5440001, size=4011376640, 03600).
</screen>
     probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is
     smaller than the work area <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
     is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you
     can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number
     of buffers (<option>-B</option> switch). You will eventually want
     to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory
     size. You may also see this message when trying to start multiple
     servers on the same machine, if their total space requested
     exceeds the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     An error like
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create semaphores: No space left on device
DETAIL:  Failed system call was semget(5440126, 17, 03600).
</screen>
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean you've run out of disk
     space. It means your kernel's limit on the number of <systemitem
     class="osname">System V</> semaphores is smaller than the number
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> wants to create. As above,
     you may be able to work around the problem by starting the
     server with a reduced number of allowed connections
     (<option>-N</option> switch), but you'll eventually want to
     increase the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you get an <quote>illegal system call</> error, it is likely that
     shared memory or semaphores are not supported in your kernel at
     all. In that case your only option is to reconfigure the kernel to
     enable these features.
    </para>

    <para>
     Details about configuring <systemitem class="osname">System V</>
     <acronym>IPC</> facilities are given in <xref linkend="sysvipc">.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="client-connection-problems">
    <title>Client Connection Problems</title>

    <para>
     Although the error conditions possible on the client side are quite
     varied and application-dependent, a few of them might be directly
     related to how the server was started up. Conditions other than
     those shown below should be documented with the respective client
     application.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "server.joe.com" and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
</screen>
     This is the generic <quote>I couldn't find a server to talk
     to</quote> failure. It looks like the above when TCP/IP
     communication is attempted. A common mistake is to forget to
     configure the server to allow TCP/IP connections.
    </para>

    <para>
     Alternatively, you'll get this when attempting Unix-domain socket
     communication to a local server:
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to
     connect to the right place. If there is in fact no server
     running there, the kernel error message will typically be either
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> or
     <computeroutput>No such file or directory</computeroutput>, as
     illustrated. (It is important to realize that
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> in this context
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that the server got your
     connection request and rejected it. That case will produce a
     different message, as shown in <xref
     linkend="client-authentication-problems">.) Other error messages
     such as <computeroutput>Connection timed out</computeroutput> may
     indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network
     connectivity.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="runtime-config">
   <Title>Run-time Configuration</Title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>configuration</primary>
    <secondary>of the server</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    There are a lot of configuration parameters that affect the
    behavior of the database system. In this subsection, we describe
    how to set configuration parameters; the following subsections
    discuss each parameter in detail.
   </para>

   <para>
    All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
    value of one of the four types: boolean, integer, floating point,
    and string. Boolean values are <literal>ON</literal>,
    <literal>OFF</literal>, <literal>TRUE</literal>,
    <literal>FALSE</literal>, <literal>YES</literal>,
    <literal>NO</literal>, <literal>1</literal>, <literal>0</literal>
    (case-insensitive) or any non-ambiguous prefix of these.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to set these parameters is to edit the file
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename><indexterm><primary>postgresql.conf</></>
    in the data directory. (A default file is installed there.) An
    example of what this file might look like is:
<programlisting>
# This is a comment
log_connections = yes
syslog = 2
search_path = '$user, public'
</programlisting>
    One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
    value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant and blank lines are
    ignored. Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) introduce comments
    anywhere.  Parameter values that are not simple identifiers or
    numbers should be single-quoted.
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm>
     <primary>SIGHUP</primary>
    </indexterm>
    The configuration file is reread whenever the
    <command>postmaster</command> process receives a
    <systemitem>SIGHUP</> signal (which is most easily sent by means
    of <literal>pg_ctl reload</>). The <command>postmaster</command>
    also propagates this signal to all currently running server
    processes so that existing sessions also get the new
    value. Alternatively, you can send the signal to a single server
    process directly.
   </para>

   <para>
    A second way to set these configuration parameters is to give them
    as a command line option to the <command>postmaster</command>, such as:
<programlisting>
postmaster -c log_connections=yes -c syslog=2
</programlisting>
    Command-line options override any conflicting settings in
    <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Occasionally it is also useful to give a command line option to
    one particular session only. The environment variable
    <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> can be used for this purpose on the
    client side:
<programlisting>
env PGOPTIONS='-c geqo=off' psql
</programlisting>
    (This works for any <application>libpq</>-based client application, not just
    <application>psql</application>.) Note that this won't work for
    parameters that are fixed when the server is started, such as the port
    number.
   </para>

   <para>
    Furthermore, it is possible to assign a set of option settings to
    a user or a database.  Whenever a session is started, the default
    settings for the user and database involved are loaded.  The
    commands <command>ALTER DATABASE</command> and <command>ALTER
    USER</command>, respectively, are used to configure these
    settings.  Per-database settings override anything received
    from the <command>postmaster</command> command-line or the
    configuration file, and in turn are overridden by per-user
    settings; both are overridden by per-session options.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some parameters can be changed in individual <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    sessions with the <xref linkend="SQL-SET" endterm="SQL-SET-title">
    command, for example:
<screen>
SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;
</screen>
    If <command>SET</> is allowed, it overrides all other sources of
    values for the parameter.  Superusers are allowed to <command>SET</>
    more values than ordinary users.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <xref linkend="SQL-SHOW" endterm="SQL-SHOW-title">
    command allows inspection of the current values of all parameters.
   </para>

   <para>
    The virtual table <structname>pg_settings</structname>
    (described in <xref linkend="view-pg-settings">) also allows
    displaying and updating session run-time parameters.  It is equivalent
    to <command>SHOW</> and <command>SET</>, but can be more convenient
    to use because it can be joined with other tables, or selected from using
    any desired selection condition.

        This variable specifies one or more shared libraries that are

        initialization function after the library name. For example
        <literal>'$libdir/mylib:mylib_init'</literal> would cause
        <literal>mylib</> to be preloaded and <literal>mylib_init</>
        to be executed. If more than one library is to be loaded,
        separate their names with commas.

        If this option is on, the <productname>PostgreSQL</> server
        will use the <function>fsync()</> system call in several places

       <para>
        However, using <function>fsync()</function> results in a
        performance penalty: when a transaction is committed,
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> must wait for the

        <varname>fsync</varname> is disabled, the operating system is
        allowed to do its best in buffering, ordering, and delaying
        writes. This can result in significantly improved performance.
        However, if the system crashes, the results of the last few
        committed transactions may be lost in part or whole. In the
        worst case, unrecoverable data corruption may occur.
       </para>

       <para>
        Due to the risks involved, there is no universally correct

       These configuration parameters provide a crude method for
       influencing the query plans chosen by the query optimizer. If
       the default plan chosen by the optimizer for a particular query
       is not optimal, a temporary solution may be found by using one
       of these configuration parameters to force the optimizer to
       choose a better plan. Other ways to improve the quality of the
       plans chosen by the optimizer include configuring the <xref
       linkend="runtime-config-query-constants"
       endterm="runtime-config-query-constants-title">, running
       <command>ANALYZE</command> more frequently, and increasing the
       amount of statistics collected for a particular column using
       <command>ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS</command>.

       <para>
        Various tuning parameters for the genetic query optimization
        algorithm: The pool size is the number of individuals in one
        population. Valid values are between 128 and 1024. If it is set
        to 0 (the default) a pool size of 2^(QS+1), where QS is the
        number of <literal>FROM</> items in the query, is taken. The effort is used
        to calculate a default for generations. Valid values are between
        1 and 80, 40 being the default. Generations specifies the number
        of iterations in the algorithm. The number must be a positive
        integer. If 0 is specified then <literal>Effort *
        Log2(PoolSize)</literal> is used. The run time of the algorithm
        is roughly proportional to the sum of pool size and generations.
        The selection bias is the selective pressure within the
        population. Values can be from 1.50 to 2.00; the latter is the
        default.

        The planner will flatten explicit inner <literal>JOIN</> constructs

        flattening of inner <literal>JOIN</>s, allowing explicit

        This variable specifies the order in which schemas are searched
        when an object (table, data type, function, etc.) is referenced by a
        simple name with no schema component.  When there are objects of
        identical names in different schemas, the one found first
        in the search path is used.  An object that is not in any of the
        schemas in the search path can only be referenced by specifying
        its containing schema with a qualified (dotted) name.
       </para>

       <para>
        The value for <varname>search_path</varname> has to be a comma-separated
        list of schema names.  If one of the list items is
        the special value <literal>$user</literal>, then the schema
        having the name returned by <function>SESSION_USER</> is substituted, if there
        is such a schema.  (If not, <literal>$user</literal> is ignored.)
       </para>

       <para>
        The system catalog schema, <literal>pg_catalog</>, is always
        searched, whether it is mentioned in the path or not.  If it is
        mentioned in the path then it will be searched in the specified
        order.  If <literal>pg_catalog</> is not in the path then it will
        be searched <emphasis>before</> searching any of the path items.
        It should also be noted that the temporary-table schema,
        <literal>pg_temp_<replaceable>nnn</></>, is implicitly searched before any of
        these.
       </para>

       <para>
        When objects are created without specifying a particular target
        schema, they will be placed in the first schema listed
        in the search path.  An error is reported if the search path is
        empty.

       <para>
        The default value for this parameter is
        <literal>'$user, public'</literal> (where the second part will be
        ignored if there is no schema named <literal>public</>).
        This supports shared use of a database (where no users
        have private schemas, and all share use of <literal>public</>),
        private per-user schemas, and combinations of these.  Other
        effects can be obtained by altering the default search path
        setting, either globally or per-user.

       <para>
        The current effective value of the search path can be examined

        <function>current_schemas()</>.  This is not quite the same as
        examining the value of <varname>search_path</varname>, since
        <function>current_schemas()</> shows how the requests
        appearing in <varname>search_path</varname> were resolved.

        This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait on a lock
        before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The
        check for deadlock is relatively slow, so the server doesn't run
        it every time it waits for a lock. We (optimistically?) assume
        that deadlocks are not common in production applications and
        just wait on the lock for a while before starting the check for a
        deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time
        wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of
        real deadlock errors. The default is 1000 (i.e., one second),
        which is probably about the smallest value you would want in
        practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it.
        Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time,
        so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before
        the waiter decides to check for deadlock.

        <productname>PostgreSQL</> has historically also accepted
        <literal>\'</>. However, use of <literal>\'</> creates security risks
        because in some client character set encodings, there are multibyte
        characters in which the last byte is numerically equivalent to ASCII
        <literal>\</>.  If client-side code does escaping incorrectly then a
        SQL-injection attack is possible.  This risk can be prevented by
        making the server reject queries in which a quote mark appears to be
        escaped by a backslash.

        return the null value (using the correct interpretation) they are not

   <para>
    Shared memory and semaphores are collectively referred to as
    <quote><systemitem class="osname">System V</>
    <acronym>IPC</></quote> (together with message queues, which are not
    relevant for <productname>PostgreSQL</>). Almost all modern
    operating systems provide these features, but not all of them have
    them turned on or sufficiently sized by default, especially systems
    with BSD heritage. (For the <systemitem class="osname">QNX</> and
    <systemitem class="osname">BeOS</> ports, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
    provides its own replacement implementation of these facilities.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The complete lack of these facilities is usually manifested by an
    <errorname>Illegal system call</> error upon server start. In
    that case there's nothing left to do but to reconfigure your
    kernel.  <productname>PostgreSQL</> won't work without them.
   </para>

   <para>
    When <productname>PostgreSQL</> exceeds one of the various hard
    <acronym>IPC</> limits, the server will refuse to start and
    should leave an instructive error message describing the problem
    encountered and what to do about it. (See also <xref
    linkend="postmaster-start-failures">.) The relevant kernel
    parameters are named consistently across different systems; <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters"> gives an overview. The methods to set
    them, however, vary. Suggestions for some platforms are given below.
    Be warned that it is often necessary to reboot your machine, and
    possibly even recompile the kernel, to change these settings.

   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>SHMMAX</primary></indexterm> The most important
    shared memory parameter is <varname>SHMMAX</>, the maximum size, in
    bytes, of a shared memory segment. If you get an error message from
    <function>shmget</> like <errorname>Invalid argument</>, it is
    possible that this limit has been exceeded. The size of the required
    shared memory segment varies both with the number of requested
    buffers (<option>-B</> option) and the number of allowed connections
    (<option>-N</> option), although the former is the most significant.
    (You can, as a temporary solution, lower these settings to eliminate
    the failure.) As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size by multiplying the number of buffers and the
    block size (8 kB by default) plus ample overhead (at least half a
    megabyte). Any error message you might get will contain the size of
    the failed allocation request.
   </para>

   <para>
    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<varname>SHMMIN</>), which should be at most
    approximately 256 kB for <productname>PostgreSQL</> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<varname>SHMMNI</>) or per-process (<varname>SHMSEG</>) should
    not cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero. Some
    systems also have a limit on the total amount of shared memory in
    the system; see the platform-specific instructions below.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<option>-N</> option), in sets of 16.  Each such set will also
    contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <quote>magic
    number</quote>, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <varname>SEMMNS</>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <literal>max_connections</> plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections (see the formula in <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters">).  The parameter <varname>SEMMNI</>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <literal>ceil(max_connections / 16)</>. Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <errorname>No space
    left on device</>, from the function <function>semget</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    In some cases it might also be necessary to increase
    <varname>SEMMAP</> to be at least on the order of
    <varname>SEMMNS</>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <varname>SEMMSL</> parameter, which determines how many
    semaphores can be in a set, must be at least 17 for
    <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Various other settings related to <quote>semaphore undo</>, such as
    <varname>SEMMNU</> and <varname>SEMUME</>, are not of concern
    for <productname>PostgreSQL</>.

        <para>
         By default, only 4 MB of shared memory is supported. Keep in
         mind that shared memory is not pageable; it is locked in RAM.
         To increase the amount of shared memory supported by your
         system, add the following to your kernel configuration
         file. A <varname>SHMALL</> value of 1024 represents 4 MB of
         shared memory. The following increases the maximum shared
         memory area to 32 MB:
<programlisting>
options "SHMALL=8192"
options "SHMMAX=\(SHMALL*PAGE_SIZE\)"
</programlisting>
         For those running 4.3 or later, you will probably need to increase
         <varname>KERNEL_VIRTUAL_MB</> above the default <literal>248</>.
         Once all changes have been made, recompile the kernel, and reboot.

<screen>
$ <userinput>bpatch -r sysptsize</>
<computeroutput>0x9 = 9</>
</screen>
        Next, add <varname>SYSPTSIZE</> as a hard-coded value in the
        kernel configuration file. Increase the value you found using
        <command>bpatch</>. Add 1 for every additional 4 MB of

   <title>Resource Limits</title>

   <para>
    Unix-like operating systems enforce various kinds of resource limits
    that might interfere with the operation of your
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server. Of particular
    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a <quote>hard</quote> and a
    <quote>soft</quote> limit. The soft limit is what actually counts
    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <function>setrlimit</function> is responsible for setting these
    parameters. The shell's built-in command <command>ulimit</command>
    (Bourne shells) or <command>limit</command> (<application>csh</>) is
    used to control the resource limits from the command line. On
    BSD-derived systems the file <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>
    controls the various resource limits set during login. See the
    operating system documentation for details. The relevant
    parameters are <varname>maxproc</varname>,
    <varname>openfiles</varname>, and <varname>datasize</varname>. For
    example:
<programlisting>
default:\
...
        :datasize-cur=256M:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :openfiles-cur=256:\
...
</programlisting>
    (<literal>-cur</literal> is the soft limit.  Append
    <literal>-max</literal> to set the hard limit.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Kernels can also have system-wide limits on some resources.
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      On <productname>Linux</productname>
      <filename>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</filename> determines the
      maximum number of open files that the kernel will support.  It can
      be changed by writing a different number into the file or by
      adding an assignment in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.
      The maximum limit of files per process is fixed at the time the
      kernel is compiled; see
      <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt</filename> for
      more information.

     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server uses one process
    per connection so you should provide for at least as many processes
    as allowed connections, in addition to what you need for the rest
    of your system.  This is usually not a problem but if you run
    several servers on one machine things might get tight.
   </para>

   <para>
    The factory default limit on open files is often set to
    <quote>socially friendly</quote> values that allow many users to
    coexist on a machine without using an inappropriate fraction of
    the system resources.  If you run many servers on a machine this
    is perhaps what you want, but on dedicated servers you may want to
    raise this limit.
   </para>

   <para>
    On the other side of the coin, some systems allow individual
    processes to open large numbers of files; if more than a few
    processes do so then the system-wide limit can easily be exceeded.
    If you find this happening, and you do not want to alter the system-wide
    limit, you can set <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s
    <varname>max_files_per_process</varname> configuration parameter to
    limit the consumption of open files.

    <filename>postmaster</filename> process) if the memory demands of
    another process cause the system to run out of virtual memory.
   </para>

   <para>
    If this happens, you will see a kernel message that looks like
    this (consult your system documentation and configuration on where
    to look for such a message):
<programlisting>
Out of Memory: Killed process 12345 (postmaster). 
</programlisting>
    This indicates that the <filename>postmaster</filename> process
    has been terminated due to memory pressure.
    Although existing database connections will continue to function
    normally, no new connections will be accepted.  To recover,
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will need to be restarted.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to avoid this problem is to run
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    on a machine where you can be sure that other processes will not
    run the machine out of memory.
   </para>

   <para>
    On Linux 2.6 and later, a better solution is to modify the kernel's
    behavior so that it will not <quote>overcommit</> memory.  This is
    done by selecting strict overcommit mode via sysctl:
<programlisting>
sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2
</programlisting>
    or placing an equivalent entry in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</>.
    You may also wish to modify the related setting 
    <literal>vm.overcommit_ratio</>.  For details see the kernel documentation
    file <filename>Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some vendors' Linux 2.4 kernels are reported to have early versions
    of the 2.6 overcommit sysctl.  However, setting
    <literal>vm.overcommit_memory</> to 2
    on a kernel that does not have the relevant code will make
    things worse not better.  It is recommended that you inspect
    the actual kernel source code (see the function
    <function>vm_enough_memory</> in the file <filename>mm/mmap.c</>)
    to verify what is supported in your copy before you try this in a 2.4
    installation.  The presence of the <filename>overcommit-accounting</>
    documentation file should <emphasis>not</> be taken as evidence that the
    feature is there.  If in any doubt, consult a kernel expert or your
    kernel vendor.

  <title>Shutting Down the Server</title>

  <indexterm zone="postmaster-shutdown">

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   There are several ways to shut down the database server. You control
   the type of shutdown by sending different signals to the
   <command>postmaster</command> process.

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem><indexterm><primary>SIGTERM</></></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       After receiving <systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem>, the server
       disallows new connections, but lets existing sessions end their
       work normally. It shuts down only after all of the sessions
       terminate normally. This is the <firstterm>Smart
       Shutdown</firstterm>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><systemitem>SIGINT</systemitem><indexterm><primary>SIGINT</></></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The server disallows new connections and sends all existing
       server processes <systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem>, which will cause them
       to abort their current transactions and exit promptly. It then
       waits for the server processes to exit and finally shuts down. This is the
       <firstterm>Fast Shutdown</firstterm>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem><indexterm><primary>SIGQUIT</></></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      This is the <firstterm>Immediate Shutdown</firstterm>, which
      will cause the <command>postmaster</command> process to send a
      <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem> to all child processes and exit
      immediately (without properly shutting itself down). The child processes
      likewise exit immediately upon receiving
      <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem>. This will lead to recovery (by
      replaying the WAL log) upon next start-up. This is recommended
      only in emergencies.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
  </para>

   <important>
    <para>
     It is best not to use <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> to shut down
     the server. This will prevent the server from releasing
     shared memory and semaphores, which may then have to be done by
     manually.
    </para>
   </important>

  <para>
   The <acronym>PID</> of the <command>postmaster</command> process can be found using the
   <command>ps</command> program, or from the file
   <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. So for
   example, to do a fast shutdown:
<screen>
$ <userinput>kill -INT `head -1 /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   The program <command>pg_ctl</command> is a shell script
   that provides a more convenient interface for shutting down the
   server.

 <sect1 id="ssl-tcp">
  <title>Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSL</title>

  <indexterm zone="ssl-tcp">
   <primary>SSL</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> has native support for using
   <acronym>SSL</> connections to encrypt client/server communications
   for increased security. This requires that
   <productname>OpenSSL</productname> is installed on both client and
   server systems and that support in <productname>PostgreSQL</> is
   enabled at build time (see <xref linkend="installation">).
  </para>

  <para>
   With <acronym>SSL</> support compiled in, the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> server can be started with
   <acronym>SSL</> enabled by setting the parameter
   <varname>ssl</varname> to on in <filename>postgresql.conf</>. When
   starting in <acronym>SSL</> mode, the server will look for the
   files <filename>server.key</> and <filename>server.crt</> in the
   data directory, which should contain the server private key
   and certificate, respectively. These files must be set up correctly
   before an <acronym>SSL</>-enabled server can start. If the private key is
   protected with a passphrase, the server will prompt for the
   passphrase and will not start until it has been entered.
  </para>

  <para>
   The server will listen for both standard and <acronym>SSL</>
   connections on the same TCP port, and will negotiate with any
   connecting client on whether to use <acronym>SSL</>. See <xref
   linkend="client-authentication"> about how to force the server to
   require use of <acronym>SSL</> for certain connections.
  </para>

  <para>
   For details on how to create your server private key and certificate,
   refer to the <productname>OpenSSL</> documentation. A simple
   self-signed certificate can be used to get started for testing, but a
   certificate signed by a certificate authority (<acronym>CA</>) (either one of the global
   <acronym>CAs</> or a local one) should be used in production so the
   client can verify the server's identity. To create a quick
   self-signed certificate, use the following
   <productname>OpenSSL</productname> command:
<programlisting>
openssl req -new -text -out server.req
</programlisting>
   Fill out the information that <command>openssl</> asks for. Make sure
   that you enter the local host name as <quote>Common Name</>; the challenge
   password can be left blank. The program will generate a key that is
   passphrase protected; it will not accept a passphrase that is less
   than four characters long. To remove the passphrase (as you must if
   you want automatic start-up of the server), run the commands
<programlisting>
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
rm privkey.pem
</programlisting>
   Enter the old passphrase to unlock the existing key. Now do
<programlisting>
openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt
chmod og-rwx server.key
</programlisting>
   to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate and to copy the
   key and certificate to where the server will look for them.

 <sect1 id="ssh-tunnels">
  <title>Secure TCP/IP Connections with <application>SSH</application> Tunnels</title>

  <indexterm zone="ssh-tunnels">
   <primary>ssh</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   One can use <application>SSH</application> to encrypt the network
   connection between clients and a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server. Done properly, this
   provides an adequately secure network connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   First make sure that an <application>SSH</application> server is
   running properly on the same machine as the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server and that you can log in using
   <command>ssh</command> as some user. Then you can establish a secure
   tunnel with a command like this from the client machine:
<programlisting>
ssh -L 3333:foo.com:5432 joe@foo.com
</programlisting>
   The first number in the <option>-L</option> argument, 3333, is the
   port number of your end of the tunnel; it can be chosen freely. The
   second number, 5432, is the remote end of the tunnel: the port
   number your server is using. The name or the address in between
   the port numbers is the host with the database server you are going
   to connect to. In order to connect to the database server using
   this tunnel, you connect to port 3333 on the local machine:
<programlisting>
psql -h localhost -p 3333 template1
</programlisting>
   To the database server it will then look as though you are really
   user <literal>joe@foo.com</literal> and it will use whatever
   authentication procedure was set up for this user. In order for the
   tunnel setup to succeed you must be allowed to connect via
   <command>ssh</command> as <literal>joe@foo.com</literal>, just
   as if you had attempted to use <command>ssh</command> to set up a
   terminal session.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    Several other applications exist that can provide secure tunnels using
    a procedure similar in concept to the one just described.
