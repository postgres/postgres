1.1)	What do I need to install PostgreSQL on HP-UX?

PostgreSQL 7.3 should work on Series 700/800 PA-RISC machines running
HP-UX 10.X or 11.X, given appropriate system patch levels and build
tools.  At least one developer routinely tests on HPUX 10.20 and we
have reports of successful installations on HPUX 11.00 and 11.11.

Aside from the PostgreSQL source distribution, you will need GNU make
(HP's make will not do), and either GNU gcc or HP's full ANSI C compiler.
If you intend to build from CVS sources rather than a distribution tarball,
you will also need flex (GNU lex) and bison (GNU yacc).

I'd also recommend making sure you are fairly up-to-date on HP
patches.  At a minimum, if you are building 64 bit binaries on on HPUX
11.11 you may need PHSS_26263 (11.11) or a successor patch otherwise
initdb may hang:

    PHSS_26263  s700_800 11.11 ld(1) and linker tools cumulative patch

On general principles you should be current on libc and ld/dld
patches, as well as compiler patches if you are using HP's C compiler.
See HP's support sites such as http://itrc.hp.com and
ftp://us-ffs.external.hp.com/ for free copies of their latest patches.


1.2)	Anything special about the build/install procedure?

If you have both HP's C compiler and GCC's, then you might want to
explicitly select the compiler to use when you run `configure':
	./configure CC=cc
for HP's C compiler, or
	./configure CC=gcc
for GCC.  If you omit this setting, then configure will pick gcc
if it has a choice.

The default install target location is /usr/local/pgsql, which
you might want to change to something under /opt.  If so, use
the --prefix switch to configure.

If you are building on a PA-RISC 2.0 machine and want the compiled
binaries to run on PA-RISC 1.1 machines you will need to specify
+DAportable in CFLAGS.


1.3)	OK, it seemed to build and install, but the regression test fails.

There are several "expected failures" due to differences between HPUX
and the regression test reference platform used by the PostgreSQL
group.  All of these should be compensated for by the regression test
comparison mechanism, with the possible exception of some
low-order-digit differences in the geometry tests, which vary depending
on which compiler and math library versions you use.

Any other error is cause for suspicion.

The parallel regression test script (gmake check) is known to lock up
when run under HP's Bourne shells: /usr/bin/sh and /sbin/sh.  This is a
known defect JAGad84609, the fix for which is not yet in any released
HP-UX version or shell patches.  To work around it, use ksh to run the
regression script:
	gmake SHELL=/bin/ksh check

If you see that the tests have stopped making progress and only a shell
process is consuming CPU, kill the shell process and start over with the
above command.
