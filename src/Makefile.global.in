# NOTES
#    Essentially all Postgres make files include this file and use the 
#    variables it sets.  
#
#    To override the default setting, create a Makefile.custom in this
#    directory and put your defines there. (Makefile.custom is included
#    near the end of this file).  Sometimes, a variable gets set in
#    Makefile.global after Makefile.custom has been included, so you can't
#    simply set that variable in Makefile.custom.  In those cases, there is
#    often another variable (like CUSTOM_COPT) that you can set in 
#    Makefile.custom that influences the later setting of the true variable
#    of interest (like CFLAGS) by Makefile.global.
#
#
#    If you change any of these defines you probably have to 
#       make clean; make
#    since no dependencies are created for these. (of course you can 
#    be crafty and check what files really depend on them and just remake
#    those).
#        
#    Before including this file, you must set the SRCDIR variable to the 
#    path of the top of the Postgres source tree (the directory that 
#    contains this file).

# Following are settings pertaining to the postgres build and 
# installation.  
# of the port.
#
# Ignore BSD_SHLIB if you're not using one of the BSD ports.  But if you
# are, and it's one that doesn't have shared libraries (NetBSD/vax is an
# example of this), set BSD_SHLIB to null in Makefile.custom.

# and other target destinations are rooted.  Of course, each of these is 
# changable separately.

# Where the postgres executables live (changeable by just putting them
# somewhere else and putting that directory in your shell PATH)

# Where libpq.a gets installed.  You must put it where your loader will
# look for it if you wish to use the -lpq convention.  Otherwise you
# can just put the absolute pathname to the library at the end of your
# command line.

# COPT
#
# COPT is for options that the sophisticated builder might want to vary 
# from one build to the next, like options to build Postgres with debugging
# information included.  COPT is meant to be set on the make command line, 
# for example with the command "make COPT=-g".  The value you see set here
# is the default that gets used if the builder does not give a value for
# COPT on his make command.
#
# There is a nonobvious relationship between -O (optimization) and 
# -Werror (consider all warnings fatal).  On some systems, if you don't
# optimize, you will always get some warnings because the system header
# files will include some unreferenced functions in the code.  These are
# functions that are supposed to be inline, so there wouldn't ordinarily
# be an "unreferenced" problem, but if you don't enable optimization, no
# inlining can happen, and hence the problem.  Therefore, we include 
# if you override -O, you override -Werror as well.
#
# CUSTOM_COPT is something the user may set in Makefile.custom

# Common values for COPT are: -g for debuggable binaries, -m486 if you are
# using a i486 or better.
