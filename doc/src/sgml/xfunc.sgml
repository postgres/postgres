  <title id="xfunc-title">Extending <acronym>SQL</acronym>: Functions</title>

  <para>
   As  it  turns  out,  part of defining a new type is the
   definition of functions  that  describe  its  behavior.
   Consequently,  while  it  is  possible  to define a new
   function without defining a new type,  the  reverse  is
   not  true.   We therefore describe how to add new functions 
   to <productname>Postgres</productname> before  describing  
   how  to  add  new types.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>Postgres</productname>  <acronym>SQL</acronym>  
   provides  three types of functions:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      query language functions 
      (functions written in <acronym>SQL</acronym>)
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      procedural language 
      functions (functions written in, for example, PLTCL or PLSQL)
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      programming  
      language  functions  (functions  written in a compiled 
      programming language such as <acronym>C</acronym>)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   Every kind
   of  function  can take a base type, a composite type or
   some combination as arguments (parameters).   In  addition, 
   every kind of function can return a base type or
   a composite type.  It's easiest to define <acronym>SQL</acronym> 
   functions, so we'll start with those.  Examples in this section 
   can also be found in <filename>funcs.sql</filename> 
   and <filename>funcs.c</filename>.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="xfunc-sql">
   <title>Query Language (<acronym>SQL</acronym>) Functions</title>

   <para>
    SQL functions execute an arbitrary list of SQL queries, returning
    the results of the last query in the list.  SQL functions in general
    return sets.  If their returntype is not specified as a
    <literal>setof</literal>,
    then an arbitrary element of the last query's result will be returned.
   </para>

   <para>
    The body of a SQL function following AS
    should be a list of queries separated by semicolons and
    bracketed within single-quote marks.  Note that quote marks used in
    the queries must be escaped, by preceding them with a backslash.
   </para>

   <para>
    Arguments to the SQL function may be referenced in the queries using
    a $n syntax: $1 refers to the first argument, $2 to the second, and so
    on.  If an argument is complex, then a <firstterm>dot</firstterm>
    notation (e.g. "$1.emp") may be
    used to access attributes of the argument or
    to invoke functions.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Examples</title>

    <para>
     To illustrate a simple SQL function, consider the following,
     which might be used to debit a bank account:

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION tp1 (int4, float8) 
    RETURNS int4
    AS 'UPDATE bank 
        SET balance = bank.balance - $2
        WHERE bank.acctountno = $1;
        SELECT 1;'
LANGUAGE 'sql';
     </programlisting>

     A user could execute this function to debit account 17 by $100.00 as
     follows:

     <programlisting>
SELECT tp1( 17,100.0);
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     The following more interesting example takes a single argument of type
     EMP, and retrieves multiple results:

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION hobbies (EMP) RETURNS SETOF hobbies
    AS 'SELECT hobbies.* FROM hobbies
        WHERE $1.name = hobbies.person'
    LANGUAGE 'sql';
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title><acronym>SQL</acronym> Functions on Base Types</title>

    <para>
     The simplest possible <acronym>SQL</acronym> function has no arguments and
     simply returns a base type, such as <literal>int4</literal>:
     
     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION one() 
    RETURNS int4
    AS 'SELECT 1 as RESULT;' 
    LANGUAGE 'sql';

SELECT one() AS answer;

+-------+
|answer |
+-------+
|1      |
+-------+
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     Notice that we defined a column name for  the  function's result
     (with  the  name  RESULT),  but this column name is not visible
     outside the function.  Hence,  the  result  is labelled answer
     instead of one.
    </para>
    <para>
     It's almost as easy to define <acronym>SQL</acronym> functions  
     that take base types as arguments.  In the example below, notice
     how we refer to the arguments within the function as $1
     and $2:

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION add_em(int4, int4) 
    RETURNS int4
    AS 'SELECT $1 + $2;' 
    LANGUAGE 'sql';

SELECT add_em(1, 2) AS answer;

+-------+
|answer |
+-------+
|3      |
+-------+
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title><acronym>SQL</acronym> Functions on Composite Types</title>

    <para>
     When  specifying  functions with arguments of composite
     types (such as EMP), we must  not  only  specify  which
     argument  we  want (as we did above with $1 and $2) but
     also the attributes of  that  argument.   For  example,
     take the function double_salary that computes what your
     salary would be if it were doubled:

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION double_salary(EMP) 
    RETURNS int4
    AS 'SELECT $1.salary * 2 AS salary;' 
    LANGUAGE 'sql';

SELECT name, double_salary(EMP) AS dream
    FROM EMP
    WHERE EMP.cubicle ~= point '(2,1)';


+-----+-------+
|name | dream |
+-----+-------+
|Sam  | 2400  |
+-----+-------+
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     Notice the use of the syntax $1.salary.
     Before launching into the  subject  of  functions  that
     return  composite  types,  we  must first introduce the
     function notation for projecting attributes.  The  simple  way 
     to explain this is that we can usually use the
     notations attribute(table)  and  table.attribute  interchangably:

     <programlisting>
--
-- this is the same as:
--  SELECT EMP.name AS youngster FROM EMP WHERE EMP.age &lt; 30
--
SELECT name(EMP) AS youngster
    FROM EMP
    WHERE age(EMP) &lt; 30;

+----------+
|youngster |
+----------+
|Sam       |
+----------+
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     As  we shall see, however, this is not always the case.
     This function notation is important when we want to use
     a  function that returns a single row.  We do this
     by assembling the entire row within the  function,
     attribute  by attribute.  This is an example of a function 
     that returns a single EMP row:

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION new_emp() 
    RETURNS EMP
    AS 'SELECT text ''None'' AS name,
        1000 AS salary,
        25 AS age,
        point ''(2,2)'' AS cubicle'
    LANGUAGE 'sql';
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     In this case we have specified each of  the  attributes
     with  a  constant value, but any computation or expression 
     could have been substituted for these constants.
     Defining a function like this can be tricky.   Some  of
     the more important caveats are as follows:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The  target  list  order must be exactly the same as
	that in which the attributes appear  in  the  CREATE
	TABLE statement that defined the composite type.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	You must typecast the expressions to match the
	composite type's definition, or you will get errors like this:
	<programlisting>
	 <computeroutput>
ERROR:  function declared to return emp returns varchar instead of text at column 1
	 </computeroutput>
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	When calling a function that returns a row, we
        cannot retrieve the entire row.  We must either
        project an attribute out of the row or pass the
        entire row into another function.

	<programlisting>
SELECT name(new_emp()) AS nobody;

+-------+
|nobody |
+-------+
|None   |
+-------+
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The reason why, in general, we must use the function
        syntax  for projecting attributes of function return
        values is that the parser  just  doesn't  understand
        the  other (dot) syntax for projection when combined
        with function calls.

	<programlisting>
SELECT new_emp().name AS nobody;
NOTICE:parser: syntax error at or near "."
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>     
    <para>
     Any collection of commands in the  <acronym>SQL</acronym>  query  
     language can be packaged together and defined as a function.
     The commands can include updates (i.e.,
     <command>INSERT</command>, <command>UPDATE</command>, and
     <command>DELETE</command>) as well
     as <command>SELECT</command> queries.  However, the final command 
     must be a <command>SELECT</command> that returns whatever is
     specified as the function's returntype.

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION clean_EMP () 
    RETURNS int4
    AS 'DELETE FROM EMP 
        WHERE EMP.salary &lt;= 0;
        SELECT 1 AS ignore_this;'
    LANGUAGE 'sql';

SELECT clean_EMP();

   <title>Procedural Language Functions</title>

   <para>
    Procedural languages aren't built into Postgres. They are offered
    by loadable modules. Please refer to the documentation for the
    PL in question for details about the syntax and how the AS
    clause is interpreted by the PL handler.
   </para>

   <para>
    There are currently three procedural languages available in the standard
    <productname>Postgres</productname> distribution (PLSQL, PLTCL and
    PLPERL), and other languages can be defined.
    Refer to <xref linkend="xplang"> for
    more information.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="xfunc-internal">
   <title>Internal Functions</title>

   <para>
    Internal functions are functions written in C that have been statically
    linked into the <productname>Postgres</productname> backend
    process. The AS
    clause gives the C-language name of the function, which need not be the
    same as the name being declared for SQL use.
    (For reasons of backwards compatibility, an empty AS
    string is accepted as meaning that the C-language function name is the
    same as the SQL name.)  Normally, all internal functions present in the
    backend are declared as SQL functions during database initialization,
    but a user could use <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>
    to create additional alias names for an internal function.
   </para>

   <para>
    Internal functions are declared in <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>
    with language name <literal>internal</literal>.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="xfunc-c">
   <title>Compiled (C) Language Functions</title>

   <para>
    Functions written in C can be compiled into dynamically loadable
    objects (also called shared libraries), and used to implement user-defined
    SQL functions.  The first time a user-defined function in a particular
    loadable object file is called in a backend session,
    the dynamic loader loads that object file into memory so that the
    function can be called.  The <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>
    for a user-defined function must therefore specify two pieces of
    information for the function: the name of the loadable
    object file, and the C name (link symbol) of the specific function to call
    within that object file.  If the C name is not explicitly specified then
    it is assumed to be the same as the SQL function name.

    <note>
     <para>
      After it is used for the first time, a dynamically loaded user
      function is retained in memory, and future calls to the function
      in the same session will only incur the small overhead of a symbol table
      lookup.
     </para>
    </note>
   </para>

   <para>
    The string that specifies the object file (the first string in the AS
    clause) should be the <emphasis>full path</emphasis> of the object
    code file for the function, bracketed by single quote marks.  If a
    link symbol is given in the AS clause, the link symbol should also be
    bracketed by single quote marks, and should be exactly the
    same as the name of the function in the C source code. On Unix systems
    the command <command>nm</command> will print all of the link
    symbols in a dynamically loadable object.

    <note>
     <para>
      <productname>Postgres</productname> will not compile a function
      automatically; it must be compiled before it is used in a CREATE
      FUNCTION command.  See below for additional information.
     </para>
    </note>
   </para>

   <para>
    Two different calling conventions are currently used for C functions.
    The newer "version 1" calling convention is indicated by writing
    a <literal>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1()</literal> macro call for the function,
    as illustrated below.  Lack of such a macro indicates an old-style
    ("version 0") function.  The language name specified in CREATE FUNCTION
    is 'C' in either case.  Old-style functions are now deprecated
    because of portability problems and lack of functionality, but they
    are still supported for compatibility reasons.
   </para>

    <title>Base Types in C-Language Functions</title>

    <para>
     The following table gives the C type required for parameters in the C
     functions that will be loaded into Postgres.  The "Defined In"
     column gives the actual header file (in the
     <filename>.../src/backend/</filename>
     directory) that the equivalent C type is defined.  Note that you should
     always include <filename>postgres.h</filename> first, and that in turn

    <para>
     Internally, <productname>Postgres</productname> regards a
     base type as a "blob  of memory."   The  user-defined  
     functions that you define over a type in turn define the 
     way  that  <productname>Postgres</productname> can operate  
     on  it.  That is, <productname>Postgres</productname> will 
     only store and retrieve the data from disk and use  your  
     user-defined functions to input, process, and output the data.
     Base types can have one of three internal formats:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	pass by value, fixed-length
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	pass by reference, fixed-length
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	pass by reference, variable-length
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     By-value  types  can  only be 1, 2 or 4 bytes in length
     (also 8 bytes, if sizeof(Datum) is 8 on your machine).
     You should be careful 
     to define your types such that  they  will  be  the  same  
     size (in bytes) on all architectures.  For example, the 
     <literal>long</literal> type is dangerous because  it  
     is 4 bytes on some machines and 8 bytes on others, whereas 
     <literal>int</literal>  type  is  4  bytes  on  most  
     Unix machines  (though  not  on most 
     personal computers).  A reasonable implementation of  
     the  <literal>int4</literal>  type  on  Unix
     machines might be:
     
<programlisting>
/* 4-byte integer, passed by value */
typedef int int4;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     On  the  other hand, fixed-length types of any size may
     be passed by-reference.  For example, here is a  sample
     implementation of a <productname>Postgres</productname> type:
     
<programlisting>
/* 16-byte structure, passed by reference */
typedef struct
{
    double  x, y;
} Point;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Only  pointers  to  such types can be used when passing
     them in and out of <productname>Postgres</productname> functions.
     To return a value of such a type, allocate the right amount of
     memory with <literal>palloc()</literal>, fill in the allocated memory,
     and return a pointer to it.  (Alternatively, you can return an input
     value of the same type by returning its pointer.  <emphasis>Never</>
     modify the contents of a pass-by-reference input value, however.)
    </para>

    <para>
     Finally, all variable-length types must also be  passed
     by  reference.   All  variable-length  types must begin
     with a length field of exactly 4 bytes, and all data to
     be  stored within that type must be located in the memory 
     immediately  following  that  length  field.   The
     length  field  is  the  total  length  of the structure
     (i.e.,  it  includes  the  size  of  the  length  field
     itself).  We can define the text type as follows:

<programlisting>
typedef struct {
    int4 length;
    char data[1];
} text;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Obviously,  the  data  field shown here is not long enough to hold
     all possible strings; it's impossible to declare such
     a  structure  in  <acronym>C</acronym>.  When manipulating 
     variable-length types, we must  be  careful  to  allocate  
     the  correct amount  of memory and initialize the length field.  
     For example, if we wanted to  store  40  bytes  in  a  text
     structure, we might use a code fragment like this:

<programlisting>
#include "postgres.h"
...
char buffer[40]; /* our source data */
...
text *destination = (text *) palloc(VARHDRSZ + 40);
destination-&gt;length = VARHDRSZ + 40;
memmove(destination-&gt;data, buffer, 40);
...
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Now that we've gone over all of the possible structures
     for base types, we can show some examples of real functions.

    <para>
     We present the <quote>old style</quote> calling convention first --- although
     this approach is now deprecated, it's easier to get a handle on
     initially.  In the version-0 method, the arguments and result
     of the C function are just declared in normal C style, but being
     careful to use the C representation of each SQL data type as shown
     above.
    </para>

    <para>
     Here are some examples:

<programlisting>
#include "postgres.h"
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

/* By Value */
         
int
add_one(int arg)
{
    return arg + 1;
}

/* By Reference, Fixed Length */

float8 *
add_one_float8(float8 *arg)
{
    float8    *result = (float8 *) palloc(sizeof(float8));

    *result = *arg + 1.0;
       
    return result;
}

Point *
makepoint(Point *pointx, Point *pointy)
{
    Point     *new_point = (Point *) palloc(sizeof(Point));

    new_point->x = pointx->x;
    new_point->y = pointy->y;
       
    return new_point;
}

/* By Reference, Variable Length */

text *
copytext(text *t)
{
    /*
     * VARSIZE is the total size of the struct in bytes.
     */
    text *new_t = (text *) palloc(VARSIZE(t));
    VARATT_SIZEP(new_t) = VARSIZE(t);
    /*
     * VARDATA is a pointer to the data region of the struct.
     */
    memcpy((void *) VARDATA(new_t), /* destination */
           (void *) VARDATA(t),     /* source */
           VARSIZE(t)-VARHDRSZ);    /* how many bytes */
    return new_t;
}

text *
concat_text(text *arg1, text *arg2)
{
    int32 new_text_size = VARSIZE(arg1) + VARSIZE(arg2) - VARHDRSZ;
    text *new_text = (text *) palloc(new_text_size);

    VARATT_SIZEP(new_text) = new_text_size;
    memcpy(VARDATA(new_text), VARDATA(arg1), VARSIZE(arg1)-VARHDRSZ);
    memcpy(VARDATA(new_text) + (VARSIZE(arg1)-VARHDRSZ),
           VARDATA(arg2), VARSIZE(arg2)-VARHDRSZ);
    return new_text;
}
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Supposing that the above code has been prepared in file
     <filename>funcs.c</filename> and compiled into a shared object,
     we could define the functions to <productname>Postgres</productname>
     with commands like this:
     
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION add_one(int4) RETURNS int4
     AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/funcs.so' LANGUAGE 'c'
     WITH (isStrict);

-- note overloading of SQL function name add_one()
CREATE FUNCTION add_one(float8) RETURNS float8
     AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/funcs.so',
        'add_one_float8'
     LANGUAGE 'c' WITH (isStrict);

CREATE FUNCTION makepoint(point, point) RETURNS point
     AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/funcs.so' LANGUAGE 'c'
     WITH (isStrict);
                         
CREATE FUNCTION copytext(text) RETURNS text
     AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/funcs.so' LANGUAGE 'c'
     WITH (isStrict);

CREATE FUNCTION concat_text(text, text) RETURNS text
     AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/funcs.so' LANGUAGE 'c'
     WITH (isStrict);
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Here <replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable> stands for the full path to
     the <productname>Postgres</productname> source tree.  Note that
     depending on your system, the filename for a shared object might
     not end in <literal>.so</literal>, but in <literal>.sl</literal>
     or something else; adapt accordingly.
    </para>

    <para>
     Notice that we have specified the functions as "strict", meaning that
     the system should automatically assume a NULL result if any input
     value is NULL.  By doing this, we avoid having to check for NULL inputs
     in the function code.  Without this, we'd have to check for NULLs
     explicitly, for example by checking for a null pointer for each
     pass-by-reference argument.  (For pass-by-value arguments, we don't
     even have a way to check!)
    </para>

    <para>
     Although this calling convention is simple to use,
     it is not very portable; on some architectures there are problems
     with passing smaller-than-int data types this way.  Also, there is
     no simple way to return a NULL result, nor to cope with NULL arguments
     in any way other than making the function strict.  The version-1
     convention, presented next, overcomes these objections.
    </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Version-1 Calling Conventions for C-Language Functions</title>

    <para>
     The version-1 calling convention relies on macros to suppress most
     of the complexity of passing arguments and results.  The C declaration
     of a version-1 function is always
<programlisting>
Datum funcname(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
</programlisting>
     In addition, the macro call
<programlisting>
PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(funcname);
</programlisting>
     must appear in the same source file (conventionally it's written
     just before the function itself).  This macro call is not needed
     for "internal"-language functions, since Postgres currently assumes
     all internal functions are version-1.  However, it is
     <emphasis>required</emphasis> for dynamically-loaded functions.
    </para>

    <para>
     In a version-1 function, each actual argument is fetched using a
     <function>PG_GETARG_<replaceable>xxx</replaceable>()</function>
     macro that corresponds to the argument's datatype, and the result
     is returned using a
     <function>PG_RETURN_<replaceable>xxx</replaceable>()</function>
     macro for the return type.
    </para>

    <para>
     Here we show the same functions as above, coded in version-1 style:

<programlisting>
#include "postgres.h"
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "fmgr.h"

/* By Value */

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(add_one);
         
Datum
add_one(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    int32   arg = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);

    PG_RETURN_INT32(arg + 1);
}

/* By Reference, Fixed Length */

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(add_one_float8);

Datum
add_one_float8(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    /* The macros for FLOAT8 hide its pass-by-reference nature */
    float8   arg = PG_GETARG_FLOAT8(0);

    PG_RETURN_FLOAT8(arg + 1.0);
}

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(makepoint);

Datum
makepoint(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    /* Here, the pass-by-reference nature of Point is not hidden */
    Point     *pointx = PG_GETARG_POINT_P(0);
    Point     *pointy = PG_GETARG_POINT_P(1);
    Point     *new_point = (Point *) palloc(sizeof(Point));

    new_point->x = pointx->x;
    new_point->y = pointy->y;
       
    PG_RETURN_POINT_P(new_point);
}

/* By Reference, Variable Length */

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(copytext);

Datum
copytext(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    text     *t = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0);
    /*
     * VARSIZE is the total size of the struct in bytes.
     */
    text     *new_t = (text *) palloc(VARSIZE(t));
    VARATT_SIZEP(new_t) = VARSIZE(t);
    /*
     * VARDATA is a pointer to the data region of the struct.
     */
    memcpy((void *) VARDATA(new_t), /* destination */
           (void *) VARDATA(t),     /* source */
           VARSIZE(t)-VARHDRSZ);    /* how many bytes */
    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(new_t);
}

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(concat_text);

Datum
concat_text(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    text  *arg1 = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0);
    text  *arg2 = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(1);
    int32 new_text_size = VARSIZE(arg1) + VARSIZE(arg2) - VARHDRSZ;
    text *new_text = (text *) palloc(new_text_size);

    VARATT_SIZEP(new_text) = new_text_size;
    memcpy(VARDATA(new_text), VARDATA(arg1), VARSIZE(arg1)-VARHDRSZ);
    memcpy(VARDATA(new_text) + (VARSIZE(arg1)-VARHDRSZ),
           VARDATA(arg2), VARSIZE(arg2)-VARHDRSZ);
    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(new_text);
}
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     The <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command> commands are the same as
     for the version-0 equivalents.
    </para>

    <para>
     At first glance, the version-1 coding conventions may appear to
     be just pointless obscurantism.  However, they do offer a number
     of improvements, because the macros can hide unnecessary detail.
     An example is that in coding add_one_float8, we no longer need to
     be aware that float8 is a pass-by-reference type.  Another
     example is that the GETARG macros for variable-length types hide
     the need to deal with fetching "toasted" (compressed or
     out-of-line) values.  The old-style <function>copytext</function>
     and <function>concat_text</function> functions shown above are
     actually wrong in the presence of toasted values, because they
     don't call <function>pg_detoast_datum()</function> on their
     inputs.  (The handler for old-style dynamically-loaded functions
     currently takes care of this detail, but it does so less
     efficiently than is possible for a version-1 function.)
    </para>

    <para>
     One big improvement in version-1 functions is better handling of NULL
     inputs and results.  The macro <function>PG_ARGISNULL(n)</function>
     allows a function to test whether each input is NULL (of course, doing
     this is only necessary in functions not declared <quote>strict</>).
     As with the
     <function>PG_GETARG_<replaceable>xxx</replaceable>()</function> macros,
     the input arguments are counted beginning at zero.
     To return a NULL result, execute <function>PG_RETURN_NULL()</function>;
     this works in both strict and non-strict functions.
    </para>

    <para>
     The version-1 function call conventions make it possible to
     return <quote>set</quote> results and implement trigger functions and
     procedural-language call handlers.  Version-1 code is also more
     portable than version-0, because it does not break ANSI C restrictions
     on function call protocol.  For more details see
     <filename>src/backend/utils/fmgr/README</filename> in the source
     distribution.

   <sect2>
    <title>Composite Types in C-Language Functions</title>

    <para>
     Composite types do not  have  a  fixed  layout  like  C
     structures.   Instances of a composite type may contain
     null fields.  In addition,  composite  types  that  are
     part  of  an  inheritance  hierarchy may have different
     fields than other members of the same inheritance hierarchy.    
     Therefore,  <productname>Postgres</productname>  provides  
     a  procedural interface for accessing fields of composite types  
     from C.  As <productname>Postgres</productname> processes 
     a set of rows, each row will be passed into your 
     function as an  opaque  structure of type <literal>TUPLE</literal>.
     Suppose we want to write a function to answer the query

<programlisting>
SELECT name, c_overpaid(emp, 1500) AS overpaid
FROM emp
WHERE name = 'Bill' OR name = 'Sam';
</programlisting>

     In the query above, we can define c_overpaid as:
     
<programlisting>
#include "postgres.h"
#include "executor/executor.h"  /* for GetAttributeByName() */

bool
c_overpaid(TupleTableSlot *t, /* the current row of EMP */
           int32 limit)
{
    bool isnull;
    int32 salary;

    salary = DatumGetInt32(GetAttributeByName(t, "salary", &amp;isnull));
    if (isnull)
        return (false);
    return salary &gt; limit;
}

/* In version-1 coding, the above would look like this: */

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(c_overpaid);

Datum
c_overpaid(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    TupleTableSlot  *t = (TupleTableSlot *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    int32            limit = PG_GETARG_INT32(1);
    bool isnull;
    int32 salary;

    salary = DatumGetInt32(GetAttributeByName(t, "salary", &amp;isnull));
    if (isnull)
        PG_RETURN_BOOL(false);
    /* Alternatively, we might prefer to do PG_RETURN_NULL() for null salary */

    PG_RETURN_BOOL(salary &gt; limit);
}
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     <function>GetAttributeByName</function> is the 
     <productname>Postgres</productname> system function that
     returns attributes out of the current row.  It has
     three arguments: the argument of type <type>TupleTableSlot*</type> passed into
     the  function, the name of the desired attribute, and a
     return parameter that tells whether  the  attribute
     is  null.   <function>GetAttributeByName</function> returns a Datum
     value that you can convert to the proper datatype by using the
     appropriate <function>DatumGet<replaceable>XXX</replaceable>()</function> macro.
    </para>

    <para>
     The  following  query  lets  <productname>Postgres</productname>  
     know  about  the <function>c_overpaid</function> function:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION c_overpaid(emp, int4) 
RETURNS bool
AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/obj/funcs.so' 
LANGUAGE 'c';
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     While there are ways to construct new rows or modify  
     existing rows from within a C function, these
     are far too complex to discuss in this manual.
    </para>

    <title>Writing Code</title>

    <para>
     We now turn to the more difficult task of writing  
     programming  language  functions.  Be warned: this section
     of the manual will not make you a programmer.  You must
     have  a  good  understanding of <acronym>C</acronym>
     (including the use of pointers and the malloc memory manager)  
     before  trying to write <acronym>C</acronym> functions for 
     use with <productname>Postgres</productname>. While  it may 
     be possible to load functions written in languages other 
     than <acronym>C</acronym> into  <productname>Postgres</productname>,  
     this  is  often difficult  (when  it  is possible at all) 
     because other languages, such as <acronym>FORTRAN</acronym> 
     and <acronym>Pascal</acronym> often do not follow the same 
     <firstterm>calling convention</firstterm>
     as <acronym>C</acronym>.  That is, other
     languages  do  not  pass  argument  and  return  values
     between functions in the same way.  For this reason, we
     will assume that your  programming  language  functions
     are written in <acronym>C</acronym>.
    </para>

    <para>
     The  basic  rules  for building <acronym>C</acronym> functions 
     are as follows:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The relevant header (include) files are installed under

	You can use <literal>pg_config --includedir</literal> to find
	out where it is on your system (or the system that your
	users will be running on).  For very low-level work you might
	need to have a complete <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
	source tree available.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	When allocating memory, use the
	<productname>Postgres</productname> routines
	<function>palloc</function> and <function>pfree</function>
	instead of the corresponding <acronym>C</acronym> library
	routines <function>malloc</function> and
	<function>free</function>.  The memory allocated by
	<function>palloc</function> will be freed automatically at the
	end of each transaction, preventing memory leaks.

	fields of your structure, there may be several bytes of
	alignment padding (holes in the structure) that may contain
	garbage values.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Most of the internal <productname>Postgres</productname> types
	are declared in <filename>postgres.h</filename>, while the function
	manager interfaces (<symbol>PG_FUNCTION_ARGS</symbol>, etc.)
	are in <filename>fmgr.h</filename>, so you will need to
	include at least these two files.  For portability reasons it's best
	to include <filename>postgres.h</filename> <emphasis>first</>,
	before any other system or user header files.
	Including <filename>postgres.h</filename> will also include
	<filename>c.h</filename>,

	for you.

   <title>Function Overloading</title>

   <para>
    More than one function may be defined with the same name, so long as
    the arguments they take are different.  In other words, function names
    can be <firstterm>overloaded</firstterm>.
    A function may also have the same name as an attribute.  In the case

    an attribute of the complex type, the attribute will always be used.

   <sect2>
    <title>Name Space Conflicts</title>

    <para>
     As of <productname>Postgres</productname> 7.0, the alternative
     form of the AS clause for the SQL
     <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command> command
     decouples the SQL function name from the function name in the C
     source code. This is now the preferred technique to accomplish
     function overloading.
    </para>

    <sect3>
     <title>Pre-7.0</title>

     <para>
      For functions written in C, the SQL name declared in
      <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>
      must be exactly the same as the actual name of the function in the
      C code (hence it must be a legal C function name).
     </para>

     <para>
      There is a subtle implication of this restriction: while the
      dynamic loading routines in most operating systems are more than 
      happy to allow you to load any number of shared libraries that 
      contain conflicting (identically-named) function names, they may 
      in fact botch the load in interesting ways.  For example, if you
      define a dynamically-loaded function that happens to have the
      same name as a function built into Postgres, the DEC OSF/1 dynamic 
      loader causes Postgres to call the function within itself rather than 
      allowing Postgres to call your function.  Hence, if you want your
      function to be used on different architectures, we recommend that 
      you do not overload C function names.
     </para>

     <para>
      There is a clever trick to get around the problem just described.
      Since there is no problem overloading SQL functions, you can 
      define a set of C functions with different names and then define 
      a set of identically-named SQL function wrappers that take the
      appropriate argument types and call the matching C function.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another solution is not to use dynamic loading, but to link your
      functions into the backend statically and declare them as INTERNAL
      functions.  Then, the functions must all have distinct C names but
      they can be declared with the same SQL names (as long as their
      argument types differ, of course).  This way avoids the overhead of
      an SQL wrapper function, at the cost of more effort to prepare a
      custom backend executable.  (This option is only available in version
      6.5 and later, since prior versions required internal functions to
      have the same name in SQL as in the C code.)
