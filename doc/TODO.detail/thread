Dear Sirs,

I have been lurking on the PostgreSQL hackers list for about 3 months now
and your names comes up more than any with helpful info about the project
so I was hoping you could help me.

Let me cut to the chase.  I have been experimenting with 7.0.2 source to
see if I could create a mutlti-threaded version of the backend so
I could link directly from java ( I have a fe<->be protocol that I use for
my apps). Needless to say I got into much more than I bargained for.  I
now have a version that works and it has some nice benefits that are very
helpful to a project that I am working on.  What I gained was

prepared statements outside of spi
batched commits (fsync)
one connection per thread
	multiple threads per process
		multiple processes per installation

I never really intended for anyone else to see the work so I drifted
pretty far from the original code.  I also ended up using Solaris threads
rather than pthreads,  I did my own implementation of the bufmgr.c and
gram.y, and used Solaris implementation of mutex in place of S_LOCK and
TAS. I grabbed all global variables and put them in an environment
variable that is thread local.  I also did some really stupid
things like making TransactionId uint64 and making all my inserts use the
same oid.

My question is this.  I would like to get some critical feedback and
suggestions about the work from others.  What is the best way to go about
this?  I thought about trying to create a project on greatbridge.org
but I am rather new to open source and the code needs commented properly
and cleaned up before too many try and look at it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance,

Myron Scott

I moved all global variables to a thread global variable which is accessed
by the method GetEnv().  Which looks like this

Env* GetEnv(void) {
	Env* env;
	thr_getspecific(*envkey,(void*)&env);
	return env;
}

The Env struct includes the CurrentMemoryContext, TopMemoryContext,
PortalHeapMemory for each instance of a connection (one thread per
connection). So, for example,
EndPortalAllocMode uses GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext

void
EndPortalAllocMode()
{
	PortalHeapMemory context;

	AssertState(PortalManagerEnabled);
	AssertState(IsA(GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext,
PortalHeapMemory));

	context = (PortalHeapMemory) GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext;
	AssertState(PointerIsValid(context->block));		/* XXX
Trap(...) */

	/* free current mode */
	AllocSetReset(&HEAPMEMBLOCK(context)->setData);
	MemoryContextFree((MemoryContext)
PortalHeapMemoryGetVariableMemory(context),
					  context->block);

	/* restore previous mode */
	context->block = FixedStackPop(&context->stackData);
}

For anyone interested,

I have posted my multi-threaded version of PostgreSQL here.

http://www.sacadia.com/mtpg.html

It is based on 7.0.2 and the TAO CORBA ORB which is here.

I know it's a major undertaking, but since the work is sort of done,
have you guys considered the port to solaris threads and seeing about
making a pthreads port of that?

I know it would probably get you considerable gains under Windows
at the expense of dropping some really really legacy system.

Or you could do what apache (is rumored) does and have it do either
threads or processes or both...

I have put a new version of my multi-threaded
postgresql experiment at

http://www.sacadia.com/mtpg.html

This one actually works.  I have added a server
based on omniORB, a CORBA 2.3 ORB from ATT.  It
   is much smaller than TAO and uses the thread per
connection model.  I haven't added the java side
of the JNI interface yet but the C++ side is there.

It's still not stable but it is much better than
the last.

There are many many globals I had to work around including all the memory
management stuff.  I basically threw everything into and "environment"
variable which I stored in a thread specific using thr_setspecific.

Performance is acually very good for what I am doing.  I was able to batch
commit transactions which cuts down on fsync calls, use prepared
statements from my client using CORBA, and the various locking calls for
the threads (cond_wait,mutex_lock, and sema_wait) seem pretty fast.  I did
some performance tests for inserts 

20 clients, 900 inserts per client, 1 insert per transaction, 4 different
tables.

7.0.2    About    10:52 average completion
multi-threaded    2:42 average completion
7.1beta3          1:13 average completion

If I increased the number of inserts per transaction, multi-threaded got
closer to 7.1 for inserts.  I haven't tested other other types of
commands
yet.
