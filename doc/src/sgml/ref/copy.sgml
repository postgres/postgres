  <title>
   Description
  </title>
  <para>
   <command>COPY</command> moves data between
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> tables and standard file-system
   files. <command>COPY TO</command> copies the contents of a table
   <emphasis>to</> a file, while <command>COPY FROM</command> copies
   data <emphasis>from</> a file to a table (appending the data to
   whatever is in the table already).
  </para>

  <para>
   If a list of columns is specified, <command>COPY</command> will
   only copy the data in the specified columns to or from the file.
   If there are any columns in the table that are not in the column list,
   <command>COPY FROM</command> will insert the default values for
   those columns.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>COPY</command> with a file name instructs the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> backend to directly read from
   or write to a file. The file must be accessible to the backend and
   the name must be specified from the viewpoint of the backend. When
   <filename>stdin</filename> or <filename>stdout</filename> is
   specified, data is transmitted via the connection between the
   client frontend and the backend.
    
    <tip>
     <para>
      Do not confuse <command>COPY</command> with the
      <application>psql</application> instruction
      <command>\copy</command>. <command>\copy</command> invokes
      <command>COPY FROM stdin</command> or <command>COPY TO
      stdout</command>, and then fetches/stores the data in a file
      accessible to the <application>psql</application> client. Thus,
      file accessibility and access rights depend on the client rather
      than the backend when <command>\copy</command> is used.
     </para>
    </tip>
   </para>

    Notes
   </title>
   <para>
    <command>COPY</command> can only be used with plain tables, not
    with views.
   </para>

   <para>
    The BINARY keyword will force all data to be
    stored/read as binary format rather than as text.  It is
    somewhat faster than the normal copy command, but a binary copy
    file is not portable across machine architectures.
    </para>

    <para>
    By default, a text copy uses a tab ("\t") character as a delimiter
    between fields. The field delimiter may be changed to any other
    single character with the keyword <option>DELIMITER</option>. Characters
	in data fields that happen to match the delimiter character will be
    backslash quoted.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    You must have <firstterm>select privilege</firstterm> on any table
    whose values are read by <command>COPY TO</command>, and
    <firstterm>insert privilege</firstterm> on a table into which values
    are being inserted by <command>COPY FROM</command>. The backend also
    needs appropriate Unix permissions for any file read or written by
    <command>COPY</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>COPY FROM</command> will invoke any triggers and check
    constraints on the destination table. However, it will not invoke rules.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>COPY</command> stops operation at the first error. This
    should not lead to problems in the event of a <command>COPY
    TO</command>, but the target relation will already have received
    earlier rows in a <command>COPY FROM</command>. These rows will not
    be visible or accessible, but they still occupy disk space. This may
    amount to a considerable amount of wasted disk space if the failure
    happened well into a large copy operation. You may wish to invoke
    <command>VACUUM</command> to recover the wasted space.
   </para>

   <para>
    Files named in a <command>COPY</command> command are read or written
    directly by the backend, not by the client application. Therefore,
    they must reside on or be accessible to the database server machine,
    not the client. They must be accessible to and readable or writable
    by the <application>PostgreSQL</application> user (the user ID the
    server runs as), not the client. <command>COPY</command> naming a
    file is only allowed to database superusers, since it allows reading
    or writing any file that the backend has privileges to access.
    
    <tip>
     <para>
      The
      <application>psql</application> instruction <command>\copy</command>
      reads or writes files on the client machine with the client's
      permissions, so it is not restricted to superusers.
     </para>
    </tip>
   </para>

   <para>
    It is recommended that the file name used in <command>COPY</command>
    always be specified as an absolute path. This is enforced by the
    backend in the case of <command>COPY TO</command>, but for
    <command>COPY FROM</command> you do have the option of reading from
    a file specified by a relative path. The path will be interpreted
    relative to the backend's working directory (somewhere below
    <filename>$PGDATA</filename>), not the client's working directory.

   <title>Text Format</title>
   <para>
    When <command>COPY</command> is used without the BINARY option,
    the file read or written is a text file with one line per table row.
    Columns (attributes) in a row are separated by the delimiter character.
    The attribute values themselves are strings generated by the
    output function, or acceptable to the input function, of each
    attribute's data type.  The specified null-value string is used in
    place of attributes that are NULL.
    <command>COPY FROM</command> will raise an error if any line of the
    input file contains more or fewer columns than are expected.
   </para>
   <para>
    If OIDS is specified, the OID is read or written as the first column,
    preceding the user data columns.  (An error is raised if OIDS is
    specified for a table that does not have OIDs.)
   </para>
   <para>
    End of data can be represented by a single line containing just
    backslash-period (<literal>\.</>).  An end-of-data marker is
    not necessary when reading from a Unix file, since the end of file
    serves perfectly well; but an end marker must be provided when copying
    data to or from a client application.
   </para>
   <para>
    Backslash characters (<literal>\</>) may be used in the
    <command>COPY</command> data to quote data characters that might
    otherwise be taken as row or column delimiters. In particular, the
    following characters <emphasis>must</> be preceded by a backslash if
    they appear as part of an attribute value: backslash itself,
    newline, and the current delimiter character.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following special backslash sequences are recognized by
    <command>COPY FROM</command>:

   <informaltable>
    <tgroup cols="2">
     <thead>
      <row>
       <entry>Sequence</entry>

      <row>
       <entry><literal>\</><replaceable>digits</></entry>
       <entry>Backslash followed by one to three octal digits specifies
       the character with that numeric code</entry>
      </row>
     </tbody>
    </tgroup>
   </informaltable>

    Presently, <command>COPY TO</command> will never emit an octal-digits
    backslash sequence, but it does use the other sequences listed above
    for those control characters.
   </para>
   <para>
    Never put a backslash before a data character <literal>N</> or period
    (<literal>.</>). Such pairs will be mistaken for the default null string
    or the end-of-data marker, respectively.  Any other backslashed character
    that is not mentioned in the above table will be taken to represent itself.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is strongly recommended that applications generating COPY data convert
    data newlines and carriage returns to the <literal>\n</> and
    <literal>\r</> sequences respectively.  At present
    (<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.2 and older versions) it is
    possible to represent a data carriage return without any special quoting,
    and to represent a data newline by a backslash and newline.  However,
    these representations will not be accepted by default in future releases.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that the end of each row is marked by a Unix-style newline
    ("\n").  Presently, <command>COPY FROM</command> will not behave as
    desired if given a file containing DOS- or Mac-style newlines.
    This is expected to change in future releases.

     The file header consists of 24 bytes of fixed fields, followed

      <term>Signature</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
12-byte sequence <literal>PGBCOPY\n\377\r\n\0</> --- note that the null
is a required part of the signature.  (The signature is designed to allow
easy identification of files that have been munged by a non-8-bit-clean
transfer.  This signature will be changed by newline-translation
filters, dropped nulls, dropped high bits, or parity changes.)

       <para>
int32 constant 0x01020304 in source's byte order. Potentially, a reader
could engage in byte-flipping of subsequent fields if the wrong byte
order is detected here.

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Flags field</term>

       <para>
int32 bit mask to denote important aspects of the file format. Bits are
numbered from 0 (<acronym>LSB</>) to 31 (<acronym>MSB</>) --- note that this field is stored
with source's endianness, as are all subsequent integer fields. Bits
16-31 are reserved to denote critical file format issues; a reader
should abort if it finds an unexpected bit set in this range. Bits 0-15
are reserved to signal backwards-compatible format issues; a reader
should simply ignore any unexpected bits set in this range. Currently
only one flag bit is defined, and the rest must be zero:

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Header extension area length</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
int32 length in bytes of remainder of header, not including self.  In
the initial version this will be zero, and the first tuple follows
immediately.  Future changes to the format might allow additional data
to be present in the header.  A reader should silently skip over any header
extension data it does not know what to do with.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
The header extension area is envisioned to contain a sequence of
self-identifying chunks.  The flags field is not intended to tell readers
what is in the extension area.  Specific design of header extension contents
is left for a later release.
    </para>

    <para>
     This design allows for both backwards-compatible header additions (add
     header extension chunks, or set low-order flag bits) and
     non-backwards-compatible changes (set high-order flag bits to signal such
     changes, and add supporting data to the extension area if needed).

     Tuples
    </title>
    <para>
Each tuple begins with an int16 count of the number of fields in the
tuple.  (Presently, all tuples in a table will have the same count, but
that might not always be true.)  Then, repeated for each field in the
tuple, there is an int16 <structfield>typlen</> word possibly followed by field data.
The <structfield>typlen</> field is interpreted thus:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Zero</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Field is NULL.  No data follows.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>&gt; 0</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Field is a fixed-length data type.  Exactly N
	bytes of data follow the <structfield>typlen</> word.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-1</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Field is a <literal>varlena</> data type.  The next four
	bytes are the <literal>varlena</> header, which contains
	the total value length including itself.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>&lt; -1</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Reserved for future use.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
For non-NULL fields, the reader can check that the <structfield>typlen</> matches the
expected <structfield>typlen</> for the destination column.  This provides a simple
but very useful check that the data is as expected.
    </para>

    <para>
There is no alignment padding or any other extra data between fields.
Note also that the format does not distinguish whether a data type is
pass-by-reference or pass-by-value.  Both of these provisions are
deliberate: they might help improve portability of the files (although
of course endianness and floating-point-format issues can still keep
you from moving a binary file across machines).
    </para>

    <para>
If OIDs are included in the dump, the OID field immediately follows the
field-count word.  It is a normal field except that it's not included
in the field-count.  In particular it has a <structfield>typlen</> --- this will allow
handling of 4-byte vs 8-byte OIDs without too much pain, and will allow
OIDs to be shown as NULL if that ever proves desirable.

     File Trailer
    </title>
    <para>
     The file trailer consists of an int16 word containing -1.  This is
     easily distinguished from a tuple's field-count word.
    </para>

    <para>
     A reader should report an error if a field-count word is neither -1
     nor the expected number of columns.  This provides an extra
     check against somehow getting out of sync with the data.

   The following is the same data, output in binary format on a
   Linux/i586 machine. The data is shown after filtering through the
   Unix utility <command>od -c</command>. The table has three fields;
   the first is <type>char(2)</type>, the second is <type>text</type>,
   and the third is <type>integer</type>. All the rows have a null value
   in the third field.
