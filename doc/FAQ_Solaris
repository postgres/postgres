1) What tools do I need to build and install PostgreSQL on Solaris?

You will need

- GNU zip (for installing the documentation)
- GNU make
- GNU readline library (optional)

Both GCC and the Sun compiler suite work.

If you like Solaris packages, you can find these tools here:

If you prefer sources, look here:

2) Why do I get problems when building with OpenSSL support?

When you build PostgreSQL with OpenSSL support you will probably get
compilation errors in the following files:

src/backend/libpq/crypt.c
src/backend/libpq/password.c
src/interfaces/libpq/fe-auth.c
src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c

This is because of a namespace conflict between the standard
/usr/include/crypt.h header and the header files provided by OpenSSL.
We believe that this should be fixed by OpenSSL.

The problem can be worked around by removing the inclusion of
<crypt.h> in these four files.
