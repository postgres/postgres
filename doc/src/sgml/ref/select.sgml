   Description
  </title>
  <para>
   <command>SELECT</command> will return rows from one or more tables.
   Candidates for selection are rows which satisfy the WHERE condition;
   if WHERE is omitted, all rows are candidates.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-where" endterm="sql-where-title">.)
  </para>

  <para>
   Actually, the returned rows are not directly the rows produced by the
   FROM/WHERE/GROUP BY/HAVING clauses; rather, the output rows are formed
   by computing the SELECT output expressions for each selected row.
   <command>*</command> can be written in the output list as a shorthand
   for all the columns of the selected rows.  Also, one can write
   <replaceable class="PARAMETER">table_name</replaceable><command>.*</command>
   as a shorthand for the columns coming from just that table.
  </para>

  <para>
   DISTINCT will eliminate duplicate rows from the result.  ALL (the
   default) will return all candidate rows, including duplicates.
  </para>

  <para>
   DISTINCT ON eliminates rows that match on all the
   specified expressions, keeping only the first row of each set of
   duplicates.  The DISTINCT ON expressions are interpreted using the
   same rules as for ORDER BY items; see below.
   Note that the <quote>first row</quote> of each set is unpredictable
   unless ORDER BY is used to ensure that the desired
   row appears first.  For example,
   <programlisting>
        SELECT DISTINCT ON (location) location, time, report
        FROM weatherReports
        ORDER BY location, time DESC;
   </programlisting>
   retrieves the most recent weather report for each location.  But if
   we had not used ORDER BY to force descending order of time values
   for each location, we'd have gotten a report of unpredictable age
   for each location.
  </para>

  <para>
   The GROUP BY clause allows a user to divide a table
   into groups of rows that match on one or more values.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-groupby" endterm="sql-groupby-title">.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The HAVING clause allows selection of only those groups of rows
   meeting the specified condition.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-having" endterm="sql-having-title">.)
  </para>
   
  <para>
   The ORDER BY clause causes the returned rows to be sorted in a specified
   order.  If ORDER BY is not given, the rows are returned in whatever order
   the system finds cheapest to produce.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-orderby" endterm="sql-orderby-title">.)
  </para>
   
  <para>
   <command>SELECT</command> queries can be combined using UNION,
   INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operators.  Use parentheses if necessary to
   determine the ordering of these operators.
  </para>
   
  <para>
   The UNION operator computes the collection of rows
   returned by the queries involved.
   Duplicate rows are eliminated unless ALL is specified.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-union" endterm="sql-union-title">.)
  </para>
   
  <para>
   The INTERSECT operator computes the rows that are common to both queries.
   Duplicate rows are eliminated unless ALL is specified.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-intersect" endterm="sql-intersect-title">.)
  </para>
   
  <para>
   The EXCEPT operator computes the rows returned by the first query but
   not the second query.
   Duplicate rows are eliminated unless ALL is specified.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-except" endterm="sql-except-title">.)
  </para>
   
  <para>
   The LIMIT clause allows a subset of the rows produced by the query
   to be returned to the user.
   (See <xref linkend="sql-limit" endterm="sql-limit-title">.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The FOR UPDATE clause causes the <command>SELECT</command>
   statement to lock the selected rows against concurrent updates.
  </para>
   
  <para>
   You must have SELECT privilege to a table to read its values
   (See the <command>GRANT</command>/<command>REVOKE</command> statements).
   Use of FOR UPDATE requires UPDATE privilege as well.

    FROM Clause
   </title>

   <para>
    The FROM clause specifies one or more source tables for the
    <command>SELECT</command>.  If multiple sources are specified, the
    result is conceptually the Cartesian product of all the rows in
    all the sources --- but usually qualification conditions are added
    to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the Cartesian
    product.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a FROM item is a simple table name, it implicitly includes rows
    from sub-tables (inheritance children) of the table.
    <command>ONLY</command> will
    suppress rows from sub-tables of the table.  Before
    <Productname>PostgreSQL</Productname> 7.1,
    this was the default result, and adding sub-tables was done
    by appending <command>*</command> to the table name.
    This old behavior is available via the command 
    <command>SET SQL_Inheritance TO OFF</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
    A FROM item can also be a parenthesized
    sub-<command>SELECT</command> (note that an alias clause is
    required for a sub-<command>SELECT</command>!).  This is an
    extremely useful feature since it's the only way to get multiple
    levels of grouping, aggregation, or sorting in a single query.
   </para>

   <para>
    A FROM item can be a table function (typically, a function that returns
    multiple rows and/or columns, though actually any function can be used).
    The function is invoked with the given argument value(s), and then its
    output is scanned as though it were a table.
   </para>

   <para>
    In some cases it is useful to define table functions that can return
    different column sets depending on how they are invoked.  To support this,
    the table function can be declared as returning the pseudo-type
    <type>record</>.  When such a function is used in FROM, it must be
    followed by an alias, or the keyword <literal>AS</> alone,
    and then by a parenthesized list of column names and types. This provides
    a query-time composite type definition. The composite type definition
    must match the actual composite type returned from the function, or an
    error will be reported at run-time.
   </para>

   <para>
    Finally, a FROM item can be a JOIN clause, which combines two simpler
    FROM items.  (Use parentheses if necessary to determine the order
    of nesting.)
   </para>

   <para>
    A CROSS JOIN or INNER JOIN is a simple Cartesian product,
    the same as you get from listing the two items at the top level of FROM.
    CROSS JOIN is equivalent to INNER JOIN ON (TRUE), that is, no rows are
    removed by qualification.  These join types are just a notational
    convenience, since they do nothing you couldn't do with plain FROM and
    WHERE.
   </para>

   <para>
    LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows in the qualified Cartesian product
    (i.e., all combined rows that pass its ON condition), plus one copy of each
    row in the left-hand table for which there was no right-hand row that
    passed the ON condition.  This left-hand row is extended to the full
    width of the joined table by inserting null values for the right-hand columns.
    Note that only the <literal>JOIN</>'s own ON or USING condition is considered while
    deciding which rows have matches.  Outer ON or WHERE conditions are
    applied afterwards.
   </para>

   <para>
    Conversely, RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all the joined rows, plus one row
    for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left).
    This is just a notational
    convenience, since you could convert it to a LEFT OUTER JOIN by switching
    the left and right inputs.
   </para>

   <para>
    FULL OUTER JOIN returns all the joined rows, plus one row for each
    unmatched left-hand row (extended with nulls on the right), plus one row
    for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left).
   </para>

   <para>
    For all the JOIN types except CROSS JOIN, you must write exactly one of
    ON <replaceable class="PARAMETER">join_condition</replaceable>,
    USING ( <replaceable class="PARAMETER">join_column_list</replaceable> ),
    or NATURAL.  ON is the most general case: you can write any qualification
    expression involving the two tables to be joined.
    A USING column list ( a, b, ... ) is shorthand for the ON condition
    left_table.a = right_table.a AND left_table.b = right_table.b ...
    Also, USING implies that only one of each pair of equivalent columns will
    be included in the JOIN output, not both.  NATURAL is shorthand for
    a USING list that mentions all similarly-named columns in the tables.

    arbitrary expressions (an extension to SQL92),
    including fields that do not appear in the
    SELECT result list.
    Thus the following statement is legal:
    <programlisting>
SELECT name FROM distributors ORDER BY code;
    </programlisting>
    A limitation of this feature is that an ORDER BY clause applying to the
    result of a UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT query may only specify an output
    column name or number, not an expression.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    Note that if an ORDER BY item is a simple name that matches both
    a result column name and an input column name, ORDER BY will interpret
    it as the result column name.  This is the opposite of the choice that
    GROUP BY will make in the same situation.  This inconsistency is
    mandated by the SQL92 standard.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    Optionally one may add the key word <literal>DESC</> (descending)
    or <literal>ASC</> (ascending) after each column name in the
    <literal>ORDER BY</> clause.  If not specified, <literal>ASC</> is
    assumed by default.  Alternatively, a specific ordering operator
    name may be specified.  <literal>ASC</> is equivalent to
    <literal>USING &lt;</> and <literal>DESC</> is equivalent to
    <literal>USING &gt;</>.
   </para>

   <para>
   The null value sorts higher than any other value in a domain. In other
   words, with ascending sort order nulls sort at the end and with
   descending sort order nulls sort at the beginning.

    LIMIT allows you to retrieve just a portion of the rows that are generated
    by the rest of the query.  If a limit count is given, no more than that
    many rows will be returned.  If an offset is given, that many rows will
    be skipped before starting to return rows.
   </para>

   <para>
    When using LIMIT, it is a good idea to use an ORDER BY clause that
    constrains the result rows into a unique order.  Otherwise you will get
    an unpredictable subset of the query's rows---you may be asking for
    the tenth through twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what
    ordering?  You don't know what ordering unless you specify ORDER BY.
   </para>

   <para>
    As of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.0, the
    query optimizer takes LIMIT into account when generating a query plan,
    so you are very likely to get different plans (yielding different row
    orders) depending on what you use for LIMIT and OFFSET.  Thus, using
    different LIMIT/OFFSET values to select different subsets of a query
    result <emphasis>will give inconsistent results</emphasis> unless
    you enforce a predictable result ordering with ORDER BY.  This is not
    a bug; it is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not
    promise to deliver the results of a query in any particular order
    unless ORDER BY is used to constrain the order.

   </para>

   <para>
    FOR UPDATE causes the rows retrieved by the query to be locked as
    though for update.  This prevents them from being modified or
    deleted by other transactions until the current transaction ends;
    that is, other transactions that attempt
    <command>UPDATE</command>, <command>DELETE</command>, or
    <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</command> of these rows will be blocked
    until the current transaction ends.  Also, if an
    <command>UPDATE</command>, <command>DELETE</command>, or
    <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</command> from another transaction has
    already locked a selected row or rows, <command>SELECT FOR
    UPDATE</command> will wait for the other transaction to complete,
    and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the
    row was deleted).  For further discussion see the concurrency
    chapter of the &cite-user;.
   </para>

   <para>
    If specific tables are named in FOR UPDATE, then only rows coming
    from those tables are locked; any other tables used in the
    <command>SELECT</command> are simply read as usual.
   </para>

   <para>
    FOR UPDATE cannot be used in contexts where returned rows can't be clearly
    identified with individual table rows; for example it can't be used with
    aggregation.
   </para>

   <para>
    FOR UPDATE may appear before LIMIT for compatibility with
    pre-7.3 applications.  However, it effectively executes after LIMIT,
    and so that is the recommended place to write it.

   <title>Extensions</title>

   <para>
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows one to omit 
the <command>FROM</command> clause from a query. This feature
was retained from the original PostQUEL query language.  It has
a straightforward use to compute the results of simple expressions:

  <programlisting>
SELECT 2+2;

 ?column?
----------
        4
  </programlisting>

Some other <acronym>SQL</acronym> databases cannot do this except by
introducing a dummy one-row table to do the select from.  A less
obvious use is to abbreviate a normal select from one or more tables:

  <programlisting>
SELECT distributors.* WHERE distributors.name = 'Westward';

 did | name
-----+----------
 108 | Westward
  </programlisting>

This works because an implicit FROM item is added for each table that is
referenced in the query but not mentioned in FROM.  While this is a convenient
shorthand, it's easy to misuse.  For example, the query
  <programlisting>
SELECT distributors.* FROM distributors d;
  </programlisting>
is probably a mistake; most likely the user meant
  <programlisting>
SELECT d.* FROM distributors d;
  </programlisting>
rather than the unconstrained join
  <programlisting>
SELECT distributors.* FROM distributors d, distributors distributors;
  </programlisting>
that he will actually get.  To help detect this sort of mistake,
<Productname>PostgreSQL</Productname> 7.1
and later will warn if the implicit-FROM feature is used in a query that also
contains an explicit FROM clause.
