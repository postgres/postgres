* Allow CLUSTER on all tables at once, and improve CLUSTER
* Generate error on CREATE OPERATOR of ~~, ~ and and ~*
* Add SIMILAR TO to allow character classes, 'pg_[a-c]%'
* Auto-destroy sequence on DROP of table with SERIAL(Ryan)
* Allow LOCK TABLE tab1, tab2, tab3 so all tables locked in unison
* Allow INSERT/UPDATE of system-generated oid value for a row
* Allow ESCAPE '\' at the end of LIKE for ANSI compliance
* Rewrite the LIKE handling by rewriting the user string with the 
  supplied ESCAPE
* Move LIKE index optimization handling to the optimizer
* Allow RULE recompilation
  
CLIENTS

* Make NULL's come out at the beginning or end depending on the 
  ORDER BY direction
* Allow flag to control COPY input/output of NULLs
* Update reltuples from COPY command
* Allow psql \copy to allow delimiters

* Allow queries across multiple databases

MISC

* Increase identifier length(NAMEDATALEN) if small performance hit
* Allow row re-use without vacuum(Vadim)
* Create a background process for each database that runs while
  database is idle, finding superceeded rows, gathering stats and vacuuming
* Add UNIQUE capability to non-btree indexes
* Certain indexes will not shrink, i.e. oid indexes with many inserts
* Restore unused oid's on backend exit if no one else has gotten oids
* Have UPDATE/DELETE clean out indexes
* Allow WHERE restriction on ctid
* Allow cursors to be DECLAREd/OPENed/CLOSEed outside transactions

* Allow subqueries in target list
* Put sort files, large objects in their on directory

* Allow BLCKSZ <= 64k, not <= 32k

PERFORMANCE
-----------

FSYNC

* Allow transaction commits with rollback with no-fsync performance
* Prevent fsync in SELECT-only queries

INDEXES

* Use indexes in ORDER BY for restrictive data sets, min(), max()
* Pull requested data directly from indexes, bypassing heap data
* Use index to restrict rows returned by multi-key index when used with
  non-consecutive keys or OR clauses, so fewer heap accesses
* Convert function(constant) into a constant for index use
* Allow LIMIT ability on single-table queries that have no ORDER BY to use
  a matching index
* Improve LIMIT processing by using index to limit rows processed
* Have optimizer take LIMIT into account when considering index scans
* Make index creation use psort code, because it is now faster(Vadim)
* Allow creation of sort temp tables > 1 Gig
* Create more system table indexes for faster cache lookups
* fix indexscan() so it does leak memory by not requiring caller to free
* Improve _bt_binsrch() to handle equal keys better, remove _bt_firsteq()(Tom)
* Allow SELECT * FROM tab WHERE int2col = 4 use int2col index

CACHE

* Cache most recent query plan(s?)
* Shared catalog cache, reduce lseek()'s by caching table size in shared area
* elog() flushes cache, try invalidating just entries from current xact,
  perhaps using invalidation cache


MISC

* Allow compression of log and meta data
* Update pg_statistic table to remove operator column
* Allow char() not to use variable-sized header to reduce disk size
* Do async I/O to do better read-ahead of data
* Fix memory exhaustion when using many OR's
* Get faster regex() code from Henry Spencer <henry@zoo.utoronto.ca>
  when it is available
* Use mmap() rather than SYSV shared memory(?)
* Process const = const parts of OR clause in separate pass
* Make oid use oidin/oidout not int4in/int4out in pg_type.h
* Improve Subplan list handling
* Allow Subplans to use efficient joins(hash, merge) with upper variable
* use fmgr_info()/fmgr_faddr() instead of fmgr() calls in high-traffic
  places, like GROUP BY, UNIQUE, index processing, etc.
* improve dynamic memory allocation by introducing tuple-context memory
  allocation
* fix memory leak in cache code when non-existant table is referenced
* In WHERE tab1.x=3 AND tab1.x=tab2.y, add tab2.y=3
* pass atttypmod through parser in more cases(Bruce)
* remove duplicate type in/out functions for disk and net

SOURCE CODE
-----------
* Add use of 'const' for varibles in source tree
* Fix C optimizer problem where fmgr_ptr calls return different types
* Add needed includes and removed unneede include files(Bruce)
* Fix port tests and __i386__/i386 test
