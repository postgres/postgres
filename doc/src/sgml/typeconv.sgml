<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> statements can, intentionally or not, require
mixing of different data types in the same expression. 
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has extensive facilities for
evaluating mixed-type expressions.
</para>

<para>
In many cases a user will not need
to understand the details of the type conversion mechanism.
However, the implicit conversions done by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
can affect the results of a query.  When necessary, these results
can be tailored by a user or programmer
using <emphasis>explicit</emphasis> type conversion.
</para>

<para>
This chapter introduces the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
type conversion mechanisms and conventions.
Refer to the relevant sections in <xref linkend="datatype"> and <xref linkend="functions">
for more information on specific data types and allowed functions and
operators.

<title>Overview</title>

<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> is a strongly typed language. That is, every data item
has an associated data type which determines its behavior and allowed usage.
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has an extensible type system that is
much more general and flexible than other <acronym>SQL</acronym> implementations.
Hence, most type conversion behavior in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
should be governed by general rules rather than by <foreignphrase>ad hoc</> heuristics, to allow
mixed-type expressions to be meaningful even with user-defined types.
</para>

<para>
The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> scanner/parser decodes lexical
elements into only five fundamental categories: integers, floating-point numbers, strings,
names, and key words.  Constants of most non-numeric types are first classified as
strings. The <acronym>SQL</acronym> language definition allows specifying type
names with strings, and this mechanism can be used in
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to start the parser down the correct
path. For example, the query

<screen>
SELECT text 'Origin' AS "label", point '(0,0)' AS "value";

 label  | value
--------+-------
 Origin | (0,0)
(1 row)
</screen>

has two literal constants, of type <type>text</type> and <type>point</type>.
If a type is not specified for a string literal, then the placeholder type
<type>unknown</type> is assigned initially, to be resolved in later
stages as described below.
</para>

<para>
There are four fundamental <acronym>SQL</acronym> constructs requiring
distinct type conversion rules in the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
parser:

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Operators
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows expressions with
prefix and postfix unary (one-argument) operators,
as well as binary (two-argument) operators.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Function calls
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Much of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> type system is built around a
rich set of functions. Function calls can have one or more arguments.
Since <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> permits function
overloading, the function name alone does not uniquely identify the function
to be called; the parser must select the right function based on the data
types of the supplied arguments.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Value Storage
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> <command>INSERT</command> and <command>UPDATE</command> statements place the results of
expressions into a table. The expressions in the statement must be matched up
with, and perhaps converted to, the types of the target columns.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>UNION</literal>, <literal>CASE</literal>, and <literal>ARRAY</literal> constructs
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Since all query results from a unionized <literal>SELECT</literal> statement
must appear in a single set of columns, the types of the results of each
<literal>SELECT</> clause must be matched up and converted to a uniform set.
Similarly, the branch expressions of a <literal>CASE</> construct must be
converted to a common type so that the <literal>CASE</> expression as a whole
has a known output type.  The same holds for <literal>ARRAY</> constructs.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
The system catalogs store information about which conversions, called
<firstterm>casts</firstterm>, between data types are valid, and how to
perform those conversions.  Additional casts can be added by the user
with the <command>CREATE CAST</command> command.  (This is usually
done in conjunction with defining new data types.  The set of casts
between the built-in types has been carefully crafted and is best not
altered.)
</para>

<indexterm>
 <primary>data type</primary>
 <secondary>category</secondary>
</indexterm>

<para>
An additional heuristic is provided in the parser to allow better guesses
at proper behavior for <acronym>SQL</acronym> standard types. There are
several basic <firstterm>type categories</firstterm> defined: <type>boolean</type>,
<type>numeric</type>, <type>string</type>, <type>bitstring</type>, <type>datetime</type>, <type>timespan</type>, <type>geometric</type>, <type>network</type>,
and user-defined. Each category, with the exception of user-defined, has
one or more <firstterm>preferred types</firstterm> which are preferentially
selected when there is ambiguity.
In the user-defined category, each type is its own preferred type.
Ambiguous expressions (those with multiple candidate parsing solutions)
can therefore often be resolved when there are multiple possible built-in types, but
they will raise an error when there are multiple choices for user-defined
types.
</para>

<para>
All type conversion rules are designed with several principles in mind:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Implicit conversions should never have surprising or unpredictable outcomes.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
User-defined types, of which the parser has no <foreignphrase>a priori</> knowledge, should be
<quote>higher</quote> in the type hierarchy. In mixed-type expressions, native types shall always
be converted to a user-defined type (of course, only if conversion is necessary).
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
User-defined types are not related. Currently, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
does not have information available to it on relationships between types, other than
hardcoded heuristics for built-in types and implicit relationships based on
available functions and casts.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
There should be no extra overhead from the parser or executor
if a query does not need implicit type conversion.
That is, if a query is well formulated and the types already match up, then the query should proceed
without spending extra time in the parser and without introducing unnecessary implicit conversion
calls into the query.
</para>

<para>
Additionally, if a query usually requires an implicit conversion for a function, and
if then the user defines a new function with the correct argument types, the parser
should use this new function and will no longer do the implicit conversion using the old function.
</para>

   The specific operator to be used in an operator invocation is determined

since an unknown-type literal does look like a string.) Otherwise, if
all the remaining candidates accept the same type category, select that
category; otherwise fail because the correct choice cannot be deduced
without more clues.  Now discard
candidates that do not accept the selected type category.  Furthermore,
if any candidate accepts a preferred type at a given argument position,

<para>
Some examples follow.
</para>

<example>
<title>Exponentiation Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
There is only one exponentiation
operator defined in the catalog, and it takes arguments of type 
<type>double precision</type>.
The scanner assigns an initial type of <type>integer</type> to both arguments
of this query expression:
<screen>
SELECT 2 ^ 3 AS "exp";

 exp
-----
   8
(1 row)
</screen>

So the parser does a type conversion on both operands and the query
is equivalent to

<screen>
SELECT CAST(2 AS double precision) ^ CAST(3 AS double precision) AS "exp";
</screen>
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>String Concatenation Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
A string-like syntax is used for working with string types as well as for
working with complex extension types.
Strings with unspecified type are matched with likely operator candidates.
</para>

<para>
An example with one unspecified argument:
<screen>
SELECT text 'abc' || 'def' AS "text and unknown";

 text and unknown
------------------
 abcdef
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
In this case the parser looks to see if there is an operator taking <type>text</type>
for both arguments. Since there is, it assumes that the second argument should
be interpreted as of type <type>text</type>.
</para>

<para>
Here is a concatenation on unspecified types:
<screen>
SELECT 'abc' || 'def' AS "unspecified";

 unspecified
-------------
 abcdef
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
In this case there is no initial hint for which type to use, since no types
are specified in the query. So, the parser looks for all candidate operators
and finds that there are candidates accepting both string-category and
bit-string-category inputs.  Since string category is preferred when available,
that category is selected, and then the 
preferred type for strings, <type>text</type>, is used as the specific
type to resolve the unknown literals to.
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>Absolute-Value and Factorial Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> operator catalog has several
entries for the prefix operator <literal>@</>, all of which implement
absolute-value operations for various numeric data types.  One of these
entries is for type <type>float8</type>, which is the preferred type in
the numeric category.  Therefore, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
will use that entry when faced with a non-numeric input:
<screen>
SELECT @ '-4.5' AS "abs";
 abs
-----
 4.5
(1 row)
</screen>
Here the system has performed an implicit conversion from <type>text</type> to <type>float8</type>
before applying the chosen operator.  We can verify that <type>float8</type> and
not some other type was used:
<screen>
SELECT @ '-4.5e500' AS "abs";

ERROR:  "-4.5e500" is out of range for type double precision
</screen>
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, the postfix operator <literal>!</> (factorial)
is defined only for integer data types, not for <type>float8</type>.  So, if we
try a similar case with <literal>!</>, we get:
<screen>
SELECT '20' ! AS "factorial";

ERROR:  operator is not unique: "unknown" !
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You may need to add explicit
type casts.
</screen>
This happens because the system can't decide which of the several
possible <literal>!</> operators should be preferred.  We can help
it out with an explicit cast:
<screen>
SELECT CAST('20' AS int8) ! AS "factorial";

      factorial

<example>
<title>Rounding Function Argument Type Resolution</title>

<para>
There is only one <function>round</function> function with two
arguments.  (The first is <type>numeric</type>, the second is
<type>integer</type>.)  So the following query automatically converts
the first argument of type <type>integer</type> to
<type>numeric</type>:

<screen>
SELECT round(4, 4);

 round
--------
 4.0000
(1 row)
</screen>

That query is actually transformed by the parser to
<screen>
SELECT round(CAST (4 AS numeric), 4);
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Since numeric constants with decimal points are initially assigned the
type <type>numeric</type>, the following query will require no type
conversion and may therefore be slightly more efficient:
<screen>
SELECT round(4.0, 4);
</screen>
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>Substring Function Type Resolution</title>

<para>
There are several <function>substr</function> functions, one of which
takes types <type>text</type> and <type>integer</type>.  If called
with a string constant of unspecified type, the system chooses the
candidate function that accepts an argument of the preferred category
<literal>string</literal> (namely of type <type>text</type>).

<screen>
SELECT substr('1234', 3);

 substr
--------
     34
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If the string is declared to be of type <type>varchar</type>, as might be the case
if it comes from a table, then the parser will try to convert it to become <type>text</type>:
<screen>
SELECT substr(varchar '1234', 3);

 substr
--------
     34
(1 row)
</screen>

This is transformed by the parser to effectively become
<screen>
SELECT substr(CAST (varchar '1234' AS text), 3);
</screen>
</para>
<para>
<note>
<para>
The parser learns from the <structname>pg_cast</> catalog that
<type>text</type> and <type>varchar</type>
are binary-compatible, meaning that one can be passed to a function that
accepts the other without doing any physical conversion.  Therefore, no
explicit type conversion call is really inserted in this case.
</para>
</note>
</para>

<para>
And, if the function is called with an argument of type <type>integer</type>, the parser will
try to convert that to <type>text</type>:
<screen>
SELECT substr(1234, 3);

 substr
--------
     34
(1 row)
</screen>

This actually executes as
<screen>
SELECT substr(CAST (1234 AS text), 3);
</screen>
This automatic transformation can succeed because there is an
implicitly invocable cast from <type>integer</type> to
<type>text</type>.

taking two arguments of which the first is that type and the second is of type
<type>integer</type>, and returning the same type.  If one is found, it is applied,
passing the column's declared length as the second parameter.

----------------------+--------
 abcdef               |     20
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
What has really happened here is that the two unknown literals are resolved
to <type>text</type> by default, allowing the <literal>||</literal> operator
to be resolved as <type>text</type> concatenation.  Then the <type>text</type>
result of the operator is converted to <type>bpchar</type> (<quote>blank-padded
char</>, the internal name of the <type>character</type> data type) to match the target
column type.  (Since the types <type>text</type> and
<type>bpchar</type> are binary-compatible, this conversion does
not insert any real function call.)  Finally, the sizing function
<literal>bpchar(bpchar, integer)</literal> is found in the system catalog
and applied to the operator's result and the stored column length.  This
type-specific function performs the required length check and addition of
padding spaces.
