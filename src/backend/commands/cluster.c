/*
 * The repack code allows for processing multiple tables at once. Because
 * of this, we cannot just run everything on a single transaction, or we
 * would be forced to acquire exclusive locks on all the tables being
 * clustered, simultaneously --- very likely leading to deadlock.
 *
 * To solve this we follow a similar strategy to VACUUM code, processing each
 * relation in a separate transaction. For this to work, we need to:
 *
 *	- provide a separate memory context so that we can pass information in
 *	  a way that survives across transactions
 *	- start a new transaction every time a new relation is clustered
 *	- check for validity of the information on to-be-clustered relations,
 *	  as someone might have deleted a relation behind our back, or
 *	  clustered one on a different index
 *	- end the transaction
 *
 * The single-relation case does not have any such overhead.
 *
 * We also allow a relation to be repacked following an index, but without
 * naming a specific one.  In that case, the indisclustered bit will be
 * looked up, and an ERROR will be thrown if no so-marked index is found.
