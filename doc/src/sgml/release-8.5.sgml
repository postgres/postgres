    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      PostgreSQL alpha releases are snapshots of development code. They
      are intended to preview and test upcoming features and to provide
      the possibility for early feedback. They should not be used in
      production installations or active development projects. While the
      PostgreSQL code is continuously subject to a number of automated
      and manual tests, alpha releases might have serious bugs. Also
      features may be changed incompatibly or removed at any time during
      the development cycle.
    </para>
    <para>
      The development cycle of a PostgreSQL major release alternates
      between periods of development and periods of integration work,
      called commit fests, normally one month each. Alpha releases are
      planned to be produced at the end of every commit fest, thus every
      two months. Since the first commit fest starts within a month from
      the beginning of development altogether, early alpha releases are
      not indicative of the likely feature set of the final release.
    </para>
    <para>
      The release notes below highlight user visible changes and new
      features. There are normally numerous bug fixes and performance
      improvements in every new snapshot of PostgreSQL, and it would be
      too bulky to attempt to list them all. Note that many bug fixes are
      also backported to stable releases of PostgreSQL, and you should be
      using those if you are looking for bug-fix-only upgrades for your
      current installations.
    </para>
    <para>
      The release notes are cumulative over all alpha releases.  Items
      that are new in the latest alpha release
      are <emphasis>emphasized</emphasis>.

    <title>Migration</title>
    <para>
      To upgrade from any release to an alpha release or from an alpha
      release to any other release will most likely require a
      dump/restore upgrade procedure. It may happen that this is not
      necessary in particular cases, but that is not verified beforehand.
      (The server will warn you in any case when a dump/restore is
      necessary if you attempt to use it with an old data directory.)
      Note, however, that the dump/restore upgrade procedure is expected
      to work for alpha releases, and problems in this area should be
      reported.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Testing</title>
    <para>
      The primary reason we release alphas is to get users to test new 
      features as early as possible.  If you are interested in helping
      with organized testing, please see

      testing information page</ulink>.

       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Remove previously deprecated configuration
         parameter add_missing_from. The system now always behaves as
         though add_missing_from were off.</emphasis>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Performance and behavioral improvements in UPDATE,
         DELETE, and SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE queries with
         joins. Various corner-cases could result in duplicated output
         rows. Set-returning functions are now prohibited in the
         target list of SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE. FOR UPDATE does not
         propagate into a WITH query anymore.</emphasis>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Fixed for SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE in conjuction with LIMIT.
          Previously, it could return fewer rows than the limit specified.</emphasis>

       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Add a WHEN clause to CREATE TRIGGER, allowing a boolean expression
          to be checked to determine whether the trigger should be fired.</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
         <emphasis>For BEFORE triggers this is mostly a matter of spec compliance; but
          for AFTER triggers it can provide a noticeable performance
          improvement, since queuing of a deferred trigger event and
          re-fetching of the row(s) at end of statement can be
          short-circuited if the trigger does not need to be fired.</emphasis>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Add exclusion constraints, which generalize the concept of
          uniqueness to support any indexable commutative operator, not just
          equality. Two rows violate the exclusion constraint if
          &quot;row1.col OP row2.col&quot; is TRUE for each of the columns in
          the constraint.</emphasis>

       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Support ORDER BY within aggregate function calls, at long last
          providing a non-kluge method for controlling the order in which
          values are fed to an aggregate function. At the same time eliminate
          the old implementation restriction that DISTINCT was only supported
          for single-argument aggregates.</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
         <emphasis>Behavioral change: formerly, agg(DISTINCT x) dropped null values of
          x unconditionally. Now, it does so only if the agg transition
          function is strict; otherwise nulls are treated as DISTINCT
          normally would, i.e., you get one copy.</emphasis>
