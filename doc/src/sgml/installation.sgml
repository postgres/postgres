      The <acronym>GNU</acronym> <productname>Readline</productname> library is used by
      default.  It allows <application>psql</application> (the
      PostgreSQL command line SQL interpreter) to remember each
      command you type, and allows you to use arrow keys to recall and
      edit previous commands.  This is very helpful and is strongly
      recommended.  If you don't want to use it then you must specify
      the <option>--without-readline</option> option to
      <filename>configure</filename>. As an alternative, you can often use the
      BSD-licensed <filename>libedit</filename> library, originally
      developed on <productname>NetBSD</productname>. The
      <filename>libedit</filename> library is
      GNU <productname>Readline</productname>-compatible and is used if
      <filename>libreadline</filename> is not found, or if
      <option>--with-libedit-preferred</option> is used as an
      option to <filename>configure</filename>. If you are using a package-based
      Linux distribution, be aware that you need both the

      To build the server programming language
      <application>PL/Perl</application> you need a full
      <productname>Perl</productname> installation, including the
      <filename>libperl</filename> library and the header files.
      The minimum required version is <productname>Perl</productname> 5.8.3.
      Since <application>PL/Perl</application> will be a shared
      library, the <indexterm><primary>libperl</primary></indexterm>
      <filename>libperl</filename> library must be a shared library
      also on most platforms.  This appears to be the default in
      recent <productname>Perl</productname> versions, but it was not
      in earlier versions, and in any case it is the choice of whomever
      installed Perl at your site.  <filename>configure</filename> will fail
      if building <application>PL/Perl</application> is selected but it cannot
      find a shared <filename>libperl</filename>.  In that case, you will have
      to rebuild and install <productname>Perl</productname> manually to be
      able to build <application>PL/Perl</application>.  During the
      configuration process for <productname>Perl</productname>, request a
      shared library.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you intend to make more than incidental use of
      <application>PL/Perl</application>, you should ensure that the
      <productname>Perl</productname> installation was built with the

      <productname>Python</productname> installation built from source, but a
      shared library is available in many operating system
      distributions.  <filename>configure</filename> will fail if
      building <application>PL/Python</application> is selected but it cannot
      find a shared <filename>libpython</filename>.  That might mean that you
      either have to install additional packages or rebuild (part of) your
      <productname>Python</productname> installation to provide this shared

      <application>Perl</application> 5.8.3 or later is needed to build from a Git checkout,
      or if you changed the input files for any of the build steps that

   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about
   350 MB for the source tree during compilation and about 60 MB for
   the installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about
   40 MB; databases take about five times the amount of space that a
   flat text file with the same data would take. If you are going to
   run the regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra
   300 MB. Use the <command>df</command> command to check free disk
   space.

  <title>Getting the Source</title>

  <para>
   The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> &version; sources can be obtained from the
   download section of our
   website: <ulink url="https://www.postgresql.org/download/"></ulink>.  You
   should get a file named <filename>postgresql-&version;.tar.gz</filename>
   or <filename>postgresql-&version;.tar.bz2</filename>. After
   you have obtained the file, unpack it:
<screen>
<userinput>gunzip postgresql-&version;.tar.gz</userinput>
<userinput>tar xf postgresql-&version;.tar</userinput>
</screen>
   (Use <command>bunzip2</command> instead of <command>gunzip</command> if
   you have the <filename>.bz2</filename> file.  Also, note that most
   modern versions of <command>tar</command> can unpack compressed archives
   directly, so you don't really need the
   separate <command>gunzip</command> or <command>bunzip2</command> step.)
   This will create a directory
   <filename>postgresql-&version;</filename> under the current directory
   with the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> sources.
   Change into that directory for the rest
   of the installation procedure.

  <title>Installation Procedure</title>

  <procedure>

  <step id="configure">
   <title>Configuration</title>

   <indexterm zone="configure">
    <primary>configure</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <filename>configure</filename> script. For a
    default installation simply enter:
<screen>
<userinput>./configure</userinput>
</screen>
    This script will run a number of tests to determine values for various
    system dependent variables and detect any quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can also run <filename>configure</filename> in a directory outside
    the source tree, and then build there, if you want to keep the build
    directory separate from the original source files.  This procedure is
    called a
    <indexterm><primary>VPATH</primary></indexterm><firstterm>VPATH</firstterm>
    build.  Here's how:
<screen>
<userinput>mkdir build_dir</userinput>
<userinput>cd build_dir</userinput>
<userinput>/path/to/source/tree/configure [options go here]</userinput>
<userinput>make</userinput>
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename> by default.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more command line options to <filename>configure</filename>.
    Typically you would customize the install location, or the set of
    optional features that are built.  <filename>configure</filename>
    has a large number of options, which are described in
    <xref linkend="configure-options"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also, <filename>configure</filename> responds to certain environment
    variables, as described in <xref linkend="configure-envvars"/>.
    These provide additional ways to customize the configuration.
   </para>
  </step>

  <step id="build">
   <title>Build</title>

   <para>
    To start the build, type either of:
<screen>
<userinput>make</userinput>
<userinput>make all</userinput>
</screen>
    (Remember to use <acronym>GNU</acronym> <application>make</application>.)
    The build will take a few minutes depending on your
    hardware. The last line displayed should be:
<screen>
All of PostgreSQL successfully made. Ready to install.
</screen>
   </para>

  <para>
   If you want to build everything that can be built, including the
   documentation (HTML and man pages), and the additional modules
   (<filename>contrib</filename>), type instead:
<screen>
<userinput>make world</userinput>
</screen>
   The last line displayed should be:
<screen>
PostgreSQL, contrib, and documentation successfully made. Ready to install.
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you want to invoke the build from another makefile rather than
    manually, you must unset <varname>MAKELEVEL</varname> or set it to zero,
    for instance like this:
<programlisting>
build-postgresql:
        $(MAKE) -C postgresql MAKELEVEL=0 all
</programlisting>
    Failure to do that can lead to strange error messages, typically about
    missing header files.

   <title>Regression Tests</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>regression test</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    If you want to test the newly built server before you install it,
    you can run the regression tests at this point. The regression
    tests are a test suite to verify that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    runs on your machine in the way the developers expected it
    to. Type:
<screen>
<userinput>make check</userinput>
</screen>
    (This won't work as root; do it as an unprivileged user.)
    See <xref linkend="regress"/> for
    detailed information about interpreting the test results. You can
    repeat this test at any later time by issuing the same command.
   </para>

  <step id="install">
   <title>Installing the Files</title>

   <note>
    <para>
     If you are upgrading an existing system be sure to read
     <xref linkend="upgrading"/>,
     which has instructions about upgrading a
     cluster.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    To install <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> enter:
<screen>
<userinput>make install</userinput>
</screen>
    This will install files into the directories that were specified
    in <xref linkend="configure"/>. Make sure that you have appropriate
    permissions to write into that area. Normally you need to do this
    step as root. Alternatively, you can create the target
    directories in advance and arrange for appropriate permissions to
    be granted.
   </para>

   <para>
    To install the documentation (HTML and man pages), enter:
<screen>
<userinput>make install-docs</userinput>
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you built the world above, type instead:
<screen>
<userinput>make install-world</userinput>
</screen>
    This also installs the documentation.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can use <literal>make install-strip</literal> instead of
    <literal>make install</literal> to strip the executable files and
    libraries as they are installed.  This will save some space.  If
    you built with debugging support, stripping will effectively
    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <literal>install-strip</literal>
    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.
   </para>

   <para>
    The standard installation provides all the header files needed for client
    application development as well as for server-side program

    <title>Client-only installation:</title>
    <para>
     If you want to install only the client applications and
     interface libraries, then you can use these commands:
<screen>
<userinput>make -C src/bin install</userinput>
<userinput>make -C src/include install</userinput>
<userinput>make -C src/interfaces install</userinput>
<userinput>make -C doc install</userinput>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Uninstallation:</title>

  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Cleaning:</title>

   <para>
    After the installation you can free disk space by removing the built
    files from the source tree with the command <command>make
    clean</command>. This will preserve the files made by the <command>configure</command>
    program, so that you can rebuild everything with <command>make</command>
    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <command>make distclean</command>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms within the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each platform.  (Alternatively, use
    a separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree
    remains unmodified.)
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   If you perform a build and then discover that your <command>configure</command>
   options were wrong, or if you change anything that <command>configure</command>
   investigates (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good
   idea to do <command>make distclean</command> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   might not propagate everywhere they need to.

    <command>configure</command>'s command line options are explained below.
    This list is not exhaustive (use <literal>./configure --help</literal>

      most cases.  If you have special needs, you can customize the
      installation subdirectories with the other options described in this
      section.  Beware however that changing the relative locations of the
      different subdirectories may render the installation non-relocatable,
      meaning you won't be able to move it after installation.
      (The <literal>man</literal> and <literal>doc</literal> locations are

       Care has been taken to make it possible to install
       <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> into shared installation locations
       (such as <filename>/usr/local/include</filename>) without
       interfering with the namespace of the rest of the system. First,
       the string <quote><literal>/postgresql</literal></quote> is
       automatically appended to <varname>datadir</varname>,
       <varname>sysconfdir</varname>, and <varname>docdir</varname>,
       unless the fully expanded directory name already contains the
       string <quote><literal>postgres</literal></quote> or
       <quote><literal>pgsql</literal></quote>. For example, if you choose
       <filename>/usr/local</filename> as prefix, the documentation will
       be installed in <filename>/usr/local/doc/postgresql</filename>,
       but if the prefix is <filename>/opt/postgres</filename>, then it
       will be in <filename>/opt/postgres/doc</filename>. The public C
       header files of the client interfaces are installed into
       <varname>includedir</varname> and are namespace-clean. The
       internal header files and the server header files are installed
       into private directories under <varname>includedir</varname>. See
       the documentation of each interface for information about how to
       access its header files. Finally, a private subdirectory will
       also be created, if appropriate, under <varname>libdir</varname>
       for dynamically loadable modules.

         to the segment size.  This avoids problems with file size limits
         that exist on many platforms.  The default segment size, 1 gigabyte,
         is safe on all supported platforms.  If your operating system has
         <quote>largefile</quote> support (which most do, nowadays), you can use
         a larger segment size.  This can be helpful to reduce the number of
         file descriptors consumed when working with very large tables.
         But be careful not to select a value larger than is supported
         by your platform and the file systems you intend to use.  Other
         tools you might wish to use, such as <application>tar</application>, could

     <filename>configure</filename> picks, you can set the
     variable <envar>CC</envar> to the program of your choice.
     By default, <filename>configure</filename> will pick
     <filename>gcc</filename> if available, else the platform's
     default (usually <filename>cc</filename>).  Similarly, you can override the
     default compiler flags if needed with the <envar>CFLAGS</envar> variable.

    <para>
     Sometimes it is useful to add compiler flags after-the-fact to the set
     that were chosen by <filename>configure</filename>.  An important example is
     that <application>gcc</application>'s <option>-Werror</option> option cannot be included
     in the <envar>CFLAGS</envar> passed to <filename>configure</filename>, because
     it will break many of <filename>configure</filename>'s built-in tests.  To add
     such flags, include them in the <envar>COPT</envar> environment variable
     while running <filename>make</filename>.  The contents of <envar>COPT</envar>
     are added to both the <envar>CFLAGS</envar> and <envar>LDFLAGS</envar>
     options set up by <filename>configure</filename>.  For example, you could do
<screen>
<userinput>make COPT='-Werror'</userinput>
</screen>
     or
<screen>
<userinput>export COPT='-Werror'</userinput>
<userinput>make</userinput>
</screen>
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      If using GCC, it is best to build with an optimization level of
      at least <option>-O1</option>, because using no optimization
      (<option>-O0</option>) disables some important compiler warnings (such
      as the use of uninitialized variables).  However, non-zero
      optimization levels can complicate debugging because stepping
      through compiled code will usually not match up one-to-one with
      source code lines.  If you get confused while trying to debug
      optimized code, recompile the specific files of interest with
      <option>-O0</option>.  An easy way to do this is by passing an option
      to <application>make</application>: <command>make PROFILE=-O0 file.o</command>.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <envar>COPT</envar> and <envar>PROFILE</envar> environment variables are
      actually handled identically by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      makefiles.  Which to use is a matter of preference, but a common habit
      among developers is to use <envar>PROFILE</envar> for one-time flag
      adjustments, while <envar>COPT</envar> might be kept set all the time.

   <para>
    On some systems with shared libraries
    you need to tell the system how to find the newly installed
    shared libraries.  The systems on which this is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary include
    <systemitem class="osname">FreeBSD</systemitem>,
    <systemitem class="osname">HP-UX</systemitem>,
    <systemitem class="osname">Linux</systemitem>,

    <systemitem class="osname">Solaris</systemitem>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The method to set the shared library search path varies between
    platforms, but the most widely-used method is to set the
    environment variable <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> like so: In Bourne
    shells (<command>sh</command>, <command>ksh</command>, <command>bash</command>, <command>zsh</command>):
<programlisting>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
    or in <command>csh</command> or <command>tcsh</command>:
<programlisting>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    Replace <literal>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</literal> with whatever you set
    <option><literal>--libdir</literal></option> to in <xref linkend="configure"/>.
    You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such as
    <filename>/etc/profile</filename> or <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename>.  Some
    good information about the caveats associated with this method can
    be found at <ulink
    url="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html"></ulink>.

    building.

    On <systemitem class="osname">Cygwin</systemitem>, put the library

   <para>
    If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps

    get a message like:
<screen>

    To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as

  <title>Supported Platforms</title>

  <para>
   A platform (that is, a CPU architecture and operating system combination)
   is considered supported by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> development
   community if the code contains provisions to work on that platform and
   it has recently been verified to build and pass its regression tests
   on that platform.  Currently, most testing of platform compatibility
   is done automatically by test machines in the
   <ulink url="https://buildfarm.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Build Farm</ulink>.
   If you are interested in using <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> on a platform
   that is not represented in the build farm, but on which the code works
   or can be made to work, you are strongly encouraged to set up a build
   farm member machine so that continued compatibility can be assured.
  </para>

  <para>
   In general, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> can be expected to work on
   these CPU architectures: x86, x86_64, IA64, PowerPC,
   PowerPC 64, S/390, S/390x, Sparc, Sparc 64, ARM, MIPS, MIPSEL,
   and PA-RISC.  Code support exists for M68K, M32R, and VAX, but these
   architectures are not known to have been tested recently.  It is often
   possible to build on an unsupported CPU type by configuring with
   <option>--disable-spinlocks</option>, but performance will be poor.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> can be expected to work on these operating
   systems: Linux (all recent distributions), Windows (XP and later),
   FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, macOS, AIX, HP/UX, and Solaris.
   Other Unix-like systems may also work but are not currently
   being tested.  In most cases, all CPU architectures supported by
   a given operating system will work.  Look in
   <xref linkend="installation-platform-notes"/> below to see if
   there is information
   specific to your operating system, particularly if using an older system.

   If you have installation problems on a platform that is known

   <para>
    PostgreSQL works on AIX, but AIX versions before about 6.1 have
    various issues and are not recommended.
    You can use GCC or the native IBM compiler <command>xlc</command>.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Memory Management</title>
    <!-- https://archives.postgresql.org/message-id/603bgqmpl9.fsf@dba2.int.libertyrms.com -->

    <para>
     AIX can be somewhat peculiar with regards to the way it does
     memory management.  You can have a server with many multiples of
     gigabytes of RAM free, but still get out of memory or address
     space errors when running applications.  One example
     is loading of extensions failing with unusual errors.
     For example, running as the owner of the PostgreSQL installation:
<screen>
=# CREATE EXTENSION plperl;
ERROR:  could not load library "/opt/dbs/pgsql/lib/plperl.so": A memory address is not in the address space for the process.
</screen>
    Running as a non-owner in the group possessing the PostgreSQL
    installation:
<screen>
=# CREATE EXTENSION plperl;
ERROR:  could not load library "/opt/dbs/pgsql/lib/plperl.so": Bad address
</screen>
     Another example is out of memory errors in the PostgreSQL server
     logs, with every memory allocation near or greater than 256 MB
     failing.
    </para>

    <para>
     The overall cause of all these problems is the default bittedness
     and memory model used by the server process.  By default, all
     binaries built on AIX are 32-bit.  This does not depend upon
     hardware type or kernel in use.  These 32-bit processes are
     limited to 4 GB of memory laid out in 256 MB segments using one
     of a few models.  The default allows for less than 256 MB in the
     heap as it shares a single segment with the stack.
    </para>

    <para>
     In the case of the <literal>plperl</literal> example, above,
     check your umask and the permissions of the binaries in your
     PostgreSQL installation.  The binaries involved in that example
     were 32-bit and installed as mode 750 instead of 755.  Due to the
     permissions being set in this fashion, only the owner or a member
     of the possessing group can load the library.  Since it isn't
     world-readable, the loader places the object into the process'
     heap instead of the shared library segments where it would
     otherwise be placed.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <quote>ideal</quote> solution for this is to use a 64-bit
     build of PostgreSQL, but that is not always practical, because
     systems with 32-bit processors can build, but not run, 64-bit
     binaries.
    </para>

    <para>
     If a 32-bit binary is desired, set <symbol>LDR_CNTRL</symbol> to
     <literal>MAXDATA=0x<replaceable>n</replaceable>0000000</literal>,
     where 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 8, before starting the PostgreSQL server,
     and try different values and <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>
     settings to find a configuration that works satisfactorily.  This
     use of <symbol>LDR_CNTRL</symbol> tells AIX that you want the
     server to have <symbol>MAXDATA</symbol> bytes set aside for the
     heap, allocated in 256 MB segments.  When you find a workable
     configuration,
     <command>ldedit</command> can be used to modify the binaries so
     that they default to using the desired heap size.  PostgreSQL can
     also be rebuilt, passing <literal>configure
     LDFLAGS="-Wl,-bmaxdata:0x<replaceable>n</replaceable>0000000"</literal>
     to achieve the same effect.
    </para>

    <para>
     For a 64-bit build, set <envar>OBJECT_MODE</envar> to 64 and
     pass <literal>CC="gcc -maix64"</literal>
     and <literal>LDFLAGS="-Wl,-bbigtoc"</literal>
     to <command>configure</command>.  (Options for
    <command>xlc</command> might differ.)  If you omit the export of
    <envar>OBJECT_MODE</envar>, your build may fail with linker errors.  When
    <envar>OBJECT_MODE</envar> is set, it tells AIX's build utilities
    such as <command>ar</command>, <command>as</command>, and <command>ld</command> what
    type of objects to default to handling.
    </para>

    <para>
     By default, overcommit of paging space can happen.  While we have
     not seen this occur, AIX will kill processes when it runs out of
     memory and the overcommit is accessed.  The closest to this that
     we have seen is fork failing because the system decided that
     there was not enough memory for another process.  Like many other
     parts of AIX, the paging space allocation method and
     out-of-memory kill is configurable on a system- or process-wide
     basis if this becomes a problem.

       Start <command>cygserver</command> for shared memory support.
       To do this, enter the command <literal>/usr/sbin/cygserver
       &amp;</literal>.  This program needs to be running anytime you
       start the PostgreSQL server or initialize a database cluster
       (<command>initdb</command>).  The
       default <command>cygserver</command> configuration may need to
       be changed (e.g., increase <symbol>SEMMNS</symbol>) to prevent
       PostgreSQL from failing due to a lack of system resources.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
        Building might fail on some systems where a locale other than
        C is in use. To fix this, set the locale to C by doing
        <command>export LANG=C.utf8</command> before building, and then
        setting it back to the previous setting after you have installed
        PostgreSQL.

       The parallel regression tests (<literal>make check</literal>)
       can generate spurious regression test failures due to
       overflowing the <function>listen()</function> backlog queue
       which causes connection refused errors or hangs.  You can limit
       the number of connections using the make
       variable <varname>MAX_CONNECTIONS</varname> thus:
<programlisting>
make MAX_CONNECTIONS=5 check
</programlisting>
       (On some systems you can have up to about 10 simultaneous
       connections.)

    It is possible to install <command>cygserver</command> and the
    PostgreSQL server as Windows NT services.  For information on how
    to do this, please refer to the <filename>README</filename>

   <para>
    To build <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> from source
    on <productname>macOS</productname>, you will need to install Apple's
    command line developer tools, which can be done by issuing
<programlisting>
xcode-select --install
</programlisting>
    (note that this will pop up a GUI dialog window for confirmation).
    You may or may not wish to also install Xcode.
   </para>

   <para>
    On recent <productname>macOS</productname> releases, it's necessary to
    embed the <quote>sysroot</quote> path in the include switches used to
    find some system header files.  This results in the outputs of
    the <application>configure</application> script varying depending on
    which SDK version was used during <application>configure</application>.
    That shouldn't pose any problem in simple scenarios, but if you are
    trying to do something like building an extension on a different machine
    than the server code was built on, you may need to force use of a
    different sysroot path.  To do that, set <varname>PG_SYSROOT</varname>,
    for example
<programlisting>
make PG_SYSROOT=<replaceable>/desired/path</replaceable> all
</programlisting>
    To find out the appropriate path on your machine, run
<programlisting>
xcrun --show-sdk-path
</programlisting>
    Note that building an extension using a different sysroot version than
    was used to build the core server is not really recommended; in the
    worst case it could result in hard-to-debug ABI inconsistencies.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can also select a non-default sysroot path when configuring, by
    specifying <varname>PG_SYSROOT</varname>
    to <application>configure</application>:
<programlisting>
./configure ... PG_SYSROOT=<replaceable>/desired/path</replaceable>
</programlisting>
    This would primarily be useful to cross-compile for some other
    macOS version.  There is no guarantee that the resulting executables
    will run on the current host.
   </para>

   <para>
    To suppress the <option>-isysroot</option> options altogether, use
<programlisting>
./configure ... PG_SYSROOT=none
</programlisting>
    (any nonexistent pathname will work).  This might be useful if you wish
    to build with a non-Apple compiler, but beware that that case is not
    tested or supported by the PostgreSQL developers.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>macOS</productname>'s <quote>System Integrity
    Protection</quote> (SIP) feature breaks <literal>make check</literal>,
    because it prevents passing the needed setting
    of <literal>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal> down to the executables being
    tested.  You can work around that by doing <literal>make
    install</literal> before <literal>make check</literal>.
    Most PostgreSQL developers just turn off SIP, though.

   <para>
    PostgreSQL for Windows can be built using MinGW, a Unix-like build
    environment for Microsoft operating systems, or using
    Microsoft's <productname>Visual C++</productname> compiler suite.
    The MinGW build procedure uses the normal build system described in
    this chapter; the Visual C++ build works completely differently
    and is described in <xref linkend="install-windows"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The native Windows port requires a 32 or 64-bit version of Windows
    2000 or later. Earlier operating systems do
    not have sufficient infrastructure (but Cygwin may be used on
    those).  MinGW, the Unix-like build tools, and MSYS, a collection
    of Unix tools required to run shell scripts
    like <command>configure</command>, can be downloaded
    from <ulink url="http://www.mingw.org/"></ulink>.  Neither is
    required to run the resulting binaries; they are needed only for
    creating the binaries.
   </para>

   <para>
     To build 64 bit binaries using MinGW, install the 64 bit tool set
     from <ulink url="https://mingw-w64.org/"></ulink>, put its bin
     directory in the <envar>PATH</envar>, and run
     <command>configure</command> with the
     <command>--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32</command> option.
   </para>

   <para>
    After you have everything installed, it is suggested that you
    run <application>psql</application>
    under <command>CMD.EXE</command>, as the MSYS console has
    buffering issues.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="windows-crash-dumps">
    <title>Collecting Crash Dumps on Windows</title>

    <para>
     If PostgreSQL on Windows crashes, it has the ability to generate
     <productname>minidumps</productname> that can be used to track down the cause
     for the crash, similar to core dumps on Unix. These dumps can be
     read using the <productname>Windows Debugger Tools</productname> or using
     <productname>Visual Studio</productname>. To enable the generation of dumps
     on Windows, create a subdirectory named <filename>crashdumps</filename>
     inside the cluster data directory. The dumps will then be written
     into this directory with a unique name based on the identifier of
     the crashing process and the current time of the crash.

    <title>Required Tools</title>

    <para>
     You can build with either GCC or Sun's compiler suite.  For
     better code optimization, Sun's compiler is strongly recommended
     on the SPARC architecture.  If
     you are using Sun's compiler, be careful not to select
     <filename>/usr/ucb/cc</filename>;
     use <filename>/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
     You can download Sun Studio
     from <ulink url="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/downloads/"></ulink>.
     Many GNU tools are integrated into Solaris 10, or they are
     present on the Solaris companion CD.  If you need packages for
     older versions of Solaris, you can find these tools
     at <ulink url="http://www.sunfreeware.com"></ulink>.

    <title>configure Complains About a Failed Test Program</title>

    <para>
     If <command>configure</command> complains about a failed test
     program, this is probably a case of the run-time linker being
     unable to find some library, probably libz, libreadline or some
     other non-standard library such as libssl.  To point it to the
     right location, set the <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> environment
     variable on the <command>configure</command> command line, e.g.,
<programlisting>
configure ... LDFLAGS="-R /usr/sfw/lib:/opt/sfw/lib:/usr/local/lib"

    <title>Compiling for Optimal Performance</title>

    <para>
     On the SPARC architecture, Sun Studio is strongly recommended for
     compilation.  Try using the <option>-xO5</option> optimization
     flag to generate significantly faster binaries.  Do not use any
     flags that modify behavior of floating-point operations
     and <varname>errno</varname> processing (e.g.,
     <option>-fast</option>).
    </para>

    <para>
     If you do not have a reason to use 64-bit binaries on SPARC,
     prefer the 32-bit version.  The 64-bit operations are slower and
     64-bit binaries are slower than the 32-bit variants.  On the
     other hand, 32-bit code on the AMD64 CPU family is not native,
     so 32-bit code is significantly slower on that CPU family.
