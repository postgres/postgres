Wed Jan 31 08:46:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Some minor additions to Statement to make our own extensions more
          portable.
        - Statement.close() will now call ResultSet.close() rather than just
          dissasociating with it.

Tue Jan 30 22:24:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Fixed bug where Statement.setMaxRows() was a global setting. Now
          limited to just itself.
        - Changed LargeObject.read(byte[],int,int) to return the actual number
          of bytes read (used to be void).
        - LargeObject now supports InputStream's!
        - PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream() now works!
        - ResultSet.getBinaryStream() now returns an InputStream that doesn't
          copy the blob into memory first!
        - Connection.isClosed() now tests to see if the connection is still alive
          rather than if it thinks it's alive.
Thu Jan 25 09:11:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Added an alternative constructor to PGSQLException so that debugging
          some more osteric bugs is easier. If only 1 arg is supplied and it's
          of type Exception, then that Exception's stacktrace is now included.

Wed Jan 24 09:18:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Removed the 8k limit by setting it to 64k

Fri Jan 19 08:47:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Applied patch submitted by John Schutz <schutz@austin.rr.com> that
          fixed a bug with ANT's SQL functions (not needed for building but nice
          to have fixed).

Thu Jan 18 17:30:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Added new error message into errors.properties "postgresql.notsensitive"
          This is used by jdbc2.ResultSet when a method is called that should
          fetch the current value of a row from the database refreshRow() for
          example.
        - These methods no longer throw the not implemented but the new noupdate
          error. This is in preparation for the Updateable ResultSet support
          which will overide these methods by extending the existing class to
          implement that functionality, but needed to show something other than
          notimplemented:
            moveToCurrentRow()
            moveToInsertRow()
            rowDeleted()
            rowInserted()
            all update*() methods, except those that took the column as a String
            as they were already implemented to convert the String to an int.
        - getFetchDirection() and setFetchDirection() now throws
          "postgresql.notimp" as we only support one direction.
          The CursorResultSet will overide this when its implemented.
        - Created a new class under jdbc2 UpdateableResultSet which extends
          ResultSet and overides the relevent update methods.
          This allows us to implement them easily at a later date.
        - In jdbc2.Connection, the following methods are now implemented:
            createStatement(type,concurrency);
            getTypeMap();
            setTypeMap(Map);
        - The JDBC2 type mapping scheme almost complete, just needs SQLInput &
          SQLOutput to be implemented.
        - Removed some Statement methods that somehow appeared in Connection.
        - In jdbc2.Statement()
            getResultSetConcurrency()
            getResultSetType()
            setResultSetConcurrency()
            setResultSetType()
        - Finally removed the old 6.5.x driver.

Thu Jan 18 12:24:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - These methods in org.postgresql.jdbc2.ResultSet are now implemented:
            getBigDecimal(int) ie: without a scale (why did this get missed?)
            getBlob(int)
            getCharacterStream(int)
            getConcurrency()
            getDate(int,Calendar)
            getFetchDirection()
            getFetchSize()
            getTime(int,Calendar)
            getTimestamp(int,Calendar)
            getType()
          NB: Where int represents the column name, the associated version
              taking a String were already implemented by calling the int
              version.
        - These methods no longer throw the not implemented but the new noupdate
          error. This is in preparation for the Updateable ResultSet support
          which will overide these methods by extending the existing class to
          implement that functionality, but needed to show something other than
          notimplemented:
            cancelRowUpdates()
            deleteRow()
        - Added new error message into errors.properties "postgresql.noupdate"
          This is used by jdbc2.ResultSet when an update method is called and
          the ResultSet is not updateable. A new method notUpdateable() has been
          added to that class to throw this exception, keeping the binary size
          down.
        - Added new error message into errors.properties "postgresql.psqlnotimp"
          This is used instead of unimplemented when it's a feature in the
          backend that is preventing this method from being implemented.
        - Removed getKeysetSize() as its not part of the ResultSet API

Thu Jan 18 09:46:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Applied modified patch from Richard Bullington-McGuire
          <rbulling@microstate.com>. I had to modify it as some of the code
          patched now exists in different classes, and some of it actually
          patched obsolete code.

Wed Jan 17 10:19:00 GMT 2001 peter@retep.org.uk
        - Updated Implementation to include both ANT & JBuilder
        - Updated README to reflect the changes since 7.0
	- Created jdbc.jpr file which allows JBuilder to be used to edit the
          source. JBuilder _CAN_NOT_ be used to compile. You must use ANT for
          that. It's only to allow JBuilders syntax checking to improve the
          drivers source. Refer to Implementation for more details

Wed Dec 20 16:19:00 GMT 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Finished build.xml and updated Driver.java.in and buildDriver to
	  match how Makefile and ANT operate.

Tue Dec 19 17:30:00 GMT 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Finally created ant build.xml file

Mon Nov 20 08:12:00 GMT 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Encoding patch to Connection by wrobell@posexperts.com.pl

Tue Oct 17 15:35:00 BST 2000 petermount@maidstone.gov.uk
	- Changed getTimestamp() again. This time Michael Stephenson's
	  <mstephenson@tirin.openworld.co.uk> solution looked far better
	  than the original solution put in June.

Tue Oct 10 13:12:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- DatabaseMetaData.supportsAlterTableWithDropColumn() as psql doesn't
	  support dropping of individual columns
	- Merged in some last patches. Only 1 left, which may not be compatible
	  with jdbc1
	- Merged in my old retepsql project. Makefile now includes it.

Mon Oct 02 12:30:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Merged in byte[] array allocation changes submitted by Gunnar R|nning
	  <gunnar@candleweb.no>

Mon Sep 25 14:22:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Removed the DriverClass kludge. Now the org.postgresql.Driver class
	  is compiled from a template file, and now has both the connection
	  class (ie jdbc1/jdbc2) and the current version's from Makefile.global

Thu Jul 20 16:30:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Fixed DatabaseMetaData.getTableTypes()

Tue Jun 06 12:00:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Added org/postgresql/DriverClass.java to the list of files removed
	  by make clean (it's dynamically built)
	- Fixed Statement, so that the update count is valid when an SQL
	  DELETE operation is done.
	- While fixing the update count, made it easier to get the OID of
	  the last insert as well. Example is in example/basic.java

Tue Jun 06 08:37:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Removed a hardwired 8K limit on query strings
	- Added some missing org.'s in Connection that prevented
	  the use of the geometric types.

Thu Jun 01 07:26:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Removed timezone in getTimestamp() methods in ResultSet.

Mon May 15 22:30:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Fixed the message Makefile produces after compiling. It still said
	  about the old Driver class, not the new package. Spotted by
	  Joseph Shraibman <jks@p1.selectacast.net>

Thu May 04 11:38:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Corrected incorrect date in CHANGELOG
	- Fixed the ImageViewer example

Wed May 03 16:47:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Fixed the Makefile so that postgresql.jar is built everytime
	  the jdbc1 or jdbc2 rules are called.
	- Fixed the threadsafe example. It had problems with autocommit

Wed May 03 14:32:00 BST 2000 petermount@it.maidstone.gov.uk
	- Rewrote the README file (the old one was 18 months old!)
	- Added @deprecated tags to org.postgresql.jdbc2.ResultSet
	  to clear some warnings issued during compilation.

Wed Apr 12 22:14:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Implemented the JDBC2 Blob interface, and ResultSet.getBlob().

Wed Apr 12 20:20:00 BST 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Fixed bug in ResultSet.absolute(). Negative rows are now supported.
	- Implemented ResultSet.relative(), afterLast().

Tue Feb  1 21:40:00 GMT 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Finally imported the contributed javax extensions by Assaf Arkin
	  arkin@exoffice.com

Mon Jan 24 21:00:00 GMT 2000 peter@retep.org.uk
	- Finally introduced the 7.0 additions to the core CVS repository.
	- All source files are now under the org.postgresql package (previously
	  they were under postgresql). The package lines now changed
	  accordingly.
	- The Makefile was rewritten so it should now work on machines that
	  can't handle the $( ) syntax.
	- Dutch translation by Arnout Kuiper (ajkuiper@wxs.nl)

Mon Sep 13 23:56:00 BST 1999 peter@retep.org.uk
	- PG_Stream.SendChar() optimised, increased default buffer size of
	  output stream to 8k, and introduced an 8k buffer on the input stream
	  Sverre H Huseby <sverrehu@online.no>
	- Added a finalize() method to Connection class in both drivers so that
	  the connection to the backend is really closed.
	- Due to many JVM's not returning a meaningful value for java.version
	  the decision for building the JDBC1.2 or JDBC2 driver is now a
	  compile time option.
	- Replaced $$(cmd...) with `cmd...` in the Makefile. This should allow
	  the driver to compile when using shells other than Bash.

Thu Sep  9 01:18:39 MEST 1999 jens@jens.de
	- fixed bug in handling of DECIMAL type

Wed Aug  4 00:25:18 CEST 1999 jens@jens.de
	- updated ResultSetMetaData.getColumnDisplaySize() to return
	  the actual display size
	- updated driver to use postgresql FE/BE-protocol version 2

Mon Aug  2 03:29:35 CEST 1999 jens@jens.de
         - fixed bug in DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys()

Sun Aug  1 18:05:42 CEST 1999 jens@jens.de
        - added support for getTransactionIsolation and setTransactionIsolation

Sun Jun 27 12:00:00 BST 1999
	- Fixed typo in postgresql.Driver that prevented compilation
	- Implemented getTimestamp() fix submitted by Philipp Matthias Hahn
	  <pmhahn@titan.lahn.de>
	- Cleaned up some comments in Connection

Wed Jun 23 06:50:00 BST 1999
	- Fixed error in errors.properties where the arguments are 0 based not
	  1 based
	- Fixed bug in postgresql.Driver where exception is thrown, then
	  intercepted rather than being passed to the calling application.
	- Removed the file postgresql/CallableStatement, as it's not used and
	  really exists in the jdbc1 & jdbc2 sub packages only.

Wed May 19 00:20:00 BST 1999
	- Internationalisation now done. Surprising that there's 68 error
	  messages in the driver ;-)

Tue May 18 07:00:00 BST 1999
	- Set the ImageViewer application to use transactions

Tue May 18 00:00:00 BST 1999
	- Just after committing, I realised why internationalisation isn't
	  working. This is now fixed (in the Makefile).

Mon May 17 23:40:00 BST 1999
	- PG_Stream.close() now attempts to send the close connection message
	  to the backend before closing the streams
	- Added batch support in the JDBC2, supplied by Yutaka Tanida
	  <yutaka@marin.or.jp>
	- Removed the old datestyle code. Now the driver uses only ISO.
	- Removed some files in the postgresql directory still in CVS that were
	  moved since 6.4.x (DatabaseMetaData.java PreparedStatement.java
	  ResultSetMetaData.java Statement.java)
	- Internationalisation of the error messages is partially implemented,
	  however it's not enabled as it only works when the jar file is
	  _not_ used, and work needs to be done.

Sun Apr 11 17:00:00 BST 1999
	- getUpdateCount() now returns the actual update count (before it
	  simply returned 1 for everything).
	- added some updates to example.basic so it would test the new update
	  count code.
	- corrected typo in a comment in Statement.java

Mon Jan 25 19:45:00 GMT 1999
	- created subfolders example/corba and example/corba/idl to hold the
	  new example showing how to hook CORBA and PostgreSQL via JDBC
	- implemented some JDBC2 methods curtesy of Joachim.Gabler@t-online.de

Sat Jan 23 10:30:00 GMT 1999
	- Changed imports in postgresql.jdbc1.ResultSetMetaData as for some
	  reason it didn't want to compile under jdk1.1.6

Tue Dec 29 15:45:00 GMT 1998
	- Refreshed the README (which was way out of date)

Tue Dec 29 15:45:00 GMT 1998
	- Finished adding the additional methods into the JDBC2 driver.
	- Had to add some explicit package references for the JDK1.2 Javac to
	  cope with the driver

Tue Dec 29 12:40:00 GMT 1998
	- Fixed package imports and some references to java.sql.ResultSet in
	  various files. Compiled and tested the JDBC1 driver.

Mon Dec 28 19:01:37 GMT 1998
	- created a new package postgresql.jdbc2 which will contain the JDBC 2
	  specific classes. A similar new package (postgresql.jdbc1) has been
	  created to hold the JDBC 1 specific classes.
	- modified Makefile to allow compilation of the JDBC 1 & 2 drivers,
	  with the possibility of building a dual-spec driver.
	- changed the version number in postgresql.Driver to 6.5
	- modified postgresql.Driver class to initiate the correct driver when
	  used under a 1.1 or 1.2+ JVM.
	- postgresql.Connection and postgresql.jdbc2.Connection now extends the
	  new class postgresql.ConnectionStub, which allows us to dynamically
	  open the JDBC1 or JDBC2 drivers.
	- enabled compilation of the driver under Win32 when using the Make
	  from the CygWin package (Cygnus B20.1 was used).
	- To make future development easier (now we have 2 specifications to
	  work with) the following classes have moved from the postgresql to
	  the postgresql.jdbc1 package:
		CallableStatement	Connection
		DatabaseMetaData	PreparedStatement
		ResultSet		ResultSetMetaData
		Statement
	  Some of these classes have common code that is not dependent on
	  either JDBC specification. These common code are still in the
	  postgresql package.
		Ie: postgresql.jdbc1.Connection extends postgresql.Connection
		and postgresql.jdbc2.Connection extends postgresql.Connection

Web Oct  7 22:00:00 BST 1998
	- removed syncronised from Connection.ExecSQL(). See next entry.
	- added new syncronised locking in the Connection.ExecSQL() and
	  FastPath.fastpath() methods. They now lock against the PG_Steam
	  object for the connection, which now provides full Thread Safety.
	- Reposted ChangeLog as it's missing from CVS.

Modifications done since 6.3.2 was released and Sun Aug 30 11:33:06 BST 1998

	- Fixed PreparedStatement.setObject as it didn't handle shorts
	- ResultSet.getDate() now handles null dates (returns null ratrher
	  than a NullPointerException)
	- ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision() new returns 0 for VARCHAR
	- Field now caches the typename->oid in a Hashtable to speed things
	  up. It removes the need for some unnecessary queries to the backend.
	- PreparedStatement.toString() now returns the SQL statement that it
	  will send to the backend. Before it did nothing.
	- DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo() now does something.
	- Connection now throws an exception if either of the user or password
	  properties are missing, as they are required for JDBC to work.
	  This occasionally occurs when the client uses the properties version
	  of getConnection(), and is a common question on the email lists.

Sun Aug 30 11:33:06 BST 1998

	- Created ChangeLog file, and entered stuff done since 6.3.2 and today
	- Change version number to 6.4 in Driver.java
	- Added fix to DatabaseMetaData.getTables() submitted by
	  Stefan Andreasen <stefan@linux.kapow.dk>
	- Added fix to DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() to handle patterns
	  submitted by Stefan Andreasen <stefan@linux.kapow.dk>
	- Set TcpNoDelay on the connection, as this gives us a 10x speed
	  improvement on FreeBSD (caused by a bug in their TCP Stack). They
	  should fix the bug before 6.4 is released, but will keep this
	  in here unless it causes more problems.
	  Submitted by Jason Venner <jason@idiom.com>
	- Removed a duplicate definition of fieldCache
	- Added a more meaningful message when the connection is refused. It
	  now says:
		Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port is
		correct, and that the postmaster is running with the -i flag,
		which enables TCP/IP networking.
	- Removed kludge in PreparedStatement.setDate() that acted as a
	  temporary fix to a bug in SimpleDateFormat, as it broke date
	  handling in JDK 1.1.6.
	- Modified PG_Stream and Connection, so that outbound data is now
	  buffered. This should give us a speed improvement, and reduce the
	  ammount of network packets generated.
	- Removed duplicate code and optimised PG_Stream.
	- PG_Stream now returns a more meaningful message when the connection
	  is broken by the backend. It now returns:
		The backend has broken the connection. Possibly the action you
		have attempted has caused it to close.
	- Removed obsolete code from Connection.
	- The error message returned when the authentication scheme is unknown
	  has been extended. It now reads:
		Authentication type ### not supported. Check that you have
		configured the pg_hba.conf file to include the client's IP
		address or Subnet, and is using a supported authentication
		scheme.
	- Connection.getMetaData() now caches the instance returned, so
	  multiple calls will return the same instance.
	- Created a test application that tests the DatabaseMetaData and
	  ResultSetMetaData classes.
	- Replaced getString(#).getBytes() with getBytes(#) which should speed
	  things up, and reduce memory useage.
	- Optimised DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures(), and implemented patterns
	- Fixed NullPointerExceptions thrown when a field is null (Internal
	  to the driver, not caused by results from the backend.
	  DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() is an example of a method that
	  causes this):
		- ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName() now returns field# where
		  # is the column name.
		- ResultSet.getObject() fixed
		- Fixed bug in psql example that was affected by null fields
		- DatabaseMetaData.getTables()
	- DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() ran a query with an ambiguous field
	  fixed.
	- getTypeInfo() optimised to increase speed and reduce memory useage
	- ResultSetMetaData.isCurrency() optimised and is now smaller.
	- Removed unnecessary code fromResultSetMetaData.getCatalogName()
	  and getSchemaName().
	- Created new class postgresql.util.PGmoney to map the money type
	- Created new class postgresql.geometric.PGline to map the line type
