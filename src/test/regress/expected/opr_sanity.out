-- OPR_SANITY
-- Sanity checks for common errors in making operator/procedure system tables:
-- pg_operator, pg_proc, pg_cast, pg_aggregate, pg_am,
-- pg_amop, pg_amproc, pg_opclass, pg_opfamily.
--
-- None of the SELECTs here should ever find any matching entries,
-- so the expected output is easy to maintain ;-).
-- A test failure indicates someone messed up an entry in the system tables.
--
-- NB: we assume the oidjoins test will have caught any dangling links,
-- that is OID or REGPROC fields that are not zero and do not match some
-- row in the linked-to table.  However, if we want to enforce that a link
-- field can't be 0, we have to check it here.
--
-- NB: run this test earlier than the create_operator test, because
-- that test creates some bogus operators...
-- Helper functions to deal with cases where binary-coercible matches are
-- allowed.
-- This should match IsBinaryCoercible() in parse_coerce.c.
