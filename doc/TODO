#A hyphen, "-", marks changes that will appear in the upcoming 8.3 release.#
#A percent sign, "%", marks items that are easier to implement.#

Bracketed items, "[]", have more detail.

This list contains all known PostgreSQL bugs and feature requests. If
you would like to work on an item, please read the Developer's FAQ
first.  There is also a developer's wiki at
http://developer.postgresql.org.


Administration
==============

* Allow administrators to safely terminate individual sessions either
  via an SQL function or SIGTERM

  Lock table corruption following SIGTERM of an individual backend
  has been reported in 8.0.  A possible cause was fixed in 8.1, but
  it is unknown whether other problems exist.  This item mostly
  requires additional testing rather than of writing any new code.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00174.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00218.php

* Check for unreferenced table files created by transactions that were
  in-progress when the server terminated abruptly

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00096.php

* Set proper permissions on non-system schemas during db creation

  Currently all schemas are owned by the super-user because they are copied
  from the template1 database.  However, since all objects are inherited
  from the template database, it is not clear that setting schemas to the db
  owner is correct.

* Add function to report the time of the most recent server reload
* Allow statistics collector information to be pulled from the collector
  process directly, rather than requiring the collector to write a
  filesystem file twice a second?
* Allow statistics last vacuum/analyze execution times to be displayed
  without requiring stats_row_level to be enabled
* Allow log_min_messages to be specified on a per-module basis

  This would allow administrators to see more detailed information from
  specific sections of the backend, e.g. checkpoints, autovacuum, etc.
  Another idea is to allow separate configuration files for each module,
  or allow arbitrary SET commands to be passed to them.

* Simplify ability to create partitioned tables

  This would allow creation of partitioned tables without requiring
  creation of triggers or rules for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, and constraints
  for rapid partition selection.  Options could include range and hash
  partition selection.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg00375.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00151.php

* Allow auto-selection of partitioned tables for min/max() operations
* Allow more complex user/database default GUC settings

  Currently ALTER USER and ALTER DATABASE support per-user and
  per-database defaults.  Consider adding per-user-and-database
  defaults so things like search_path can be defaulted for a
  specific user connecting to a specific database.

* Allow custom variable classes that can restrict who can set the values

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-11/msg00911.php

* Implement the SQL standard mechanism whereby REVOKE ROLE revokes only
  the privilege granted by the invoking role, and not those granted
  by other roles

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-05/msg00010.php

* Allow SSL authentication/encryption over unix domain sockets

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-12/msg00924.php

* Allow client certificate names to be checked against the client
  hostname

  This is already implemented in
  libpq/fe-secure.c::verify_peer_name_matches_certificate() but the code
  is commented out.

* Configuration files

	o Allow pg_hba.conf to specify host names along with IP addresses

	  Host name lookup could occur when the postmaster reads the
	  pg_hba.conf file, or when the backend starts.  Another
	  solution would be to reverse lookup the connection IP and
	  check that hostname against the host names in pg_hba.conf.
	  We could also then check that the host name maps to the IP
	  address.

	o %Allow postgresql.conf file values to be changed via an SQL
	  API, perhaps using SET GLOBAL
	o Allow the server to be stopped/restarted via an SQL API
	o Issue a warning if a change-on-restart-only postgresql.conf value
	  is modified  and the server config files are reloaded
	o Consider normalizing fractions in postgresql.conf, perhaps
	  using '%'

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-06/msg00550.php


* Tablespaces

	o Allow a database in tablespace t1 with tables created in
	  tablespace t2 to be used as a template for a new database created
	  with default tablespace t2

	  Currently all objects in the default database tablespace must
	  have default tablespace specifications. This is because new
	  databases are created by copying directories. If you mix default
	  tablespace tables and tablespace-specified tables in the same
	  directory, creating a new database from such a mixed directory
	  would create a new database with tables that had incorrect
	  explicit tablespaces.  To fix this would require modifying
	  pg_class in the newly copied database, which we don't currently
	  do.

	o Allow reporting of which objects are in which tablespaces

	  This item is difficult because a tablespace can contain objects
	  from multiple databases. There is a server-side function that
	  returns the databases which use a specific tablespace, so this
	  requires a tool that will call that function and connect to each
	  database to find the objects in each database for that tablespace.

	o Allow WAL replay of CREATE TABLESPACE to work when the directory
	  structure on the recovery computer is different from the original

	o Allow per-tablespace quotas


* Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)

	  o Allow a warm standby system to also allow read-only statements
	    [pitr]

	    http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg00050.php

	  o %Create dump tool for write-ahead logs for use in determining
	    transaction id for point-in-time recovery

	    This is useful for checking PITR recovery.

	  o Allow recovery.conf to support the same syntax as
	    postgresql.conf, including quoting

	    http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00497.php


Data Types
==========

* Change NUMERIC to enforce the maximum precision
* Reduce storage space for small NUMERICs

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg01331.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-02/msg00505.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-06/msg00715.php

* Fix data types where equality comparison isn't intuitive, e.g. box
* Add support for public SYNONYMs

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00519.php

* Fix CREATE CAST on DOMAINs

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-05/msg00072.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01681.php

* Add support for SQL-standard GENERATED/IDENTITY columns

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-07/msg00543.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00038.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-05/msg00344.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-05/msg00076.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg00604.php

* Improve XML support

  http://developer.postgresql.org/index.php/XML_Support

* Consider placing all sequences in a single table, or create a system
  view

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-03/msg00008.php

* Allow the UUID type to accept non-standard formats

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg01214.php

* Allow text search dictionary to filter out only stop words

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-11/msg00081.php

* Consider a function-based API for '@@' full text searches

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-11/msg00511.php


* Dates and Times

	o Allow infinite dates and intervals just like infinite timestamps
	o Merge hardwired timezone names with the TZ database; allow either
	  kind everywhere a TZ name is currently taken
	o Allow TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to store the original timezone
	  information, either zone name or offset from UTC [timezone]

	  If the TIMESTAMP value is stored with a time zone name, interval
	  computations should adjust based on the time zone rules.

	o Fix SELECT '0.01 years'::interval, '0.01 months'::interval
	o Add a GUC variable to allow output of interval values in ISO8601
	  format
	o Have timestamp subtraction not call justify_hours()?

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-sql/2006-10/msg00059.php

	o Improve timestamptz subtraction to be DST-aware

	  Currently subtracting one date from another that crosses a
	  daylight savings time adjustment can return '1 day 1 hour', but
	  adding that back to the first date returns a time one hour in
	  the future.  This is caused by the adjustment of '25 hours' to
	  '1 day 1 hour', and '1 day' is the same time the next day, even
	  if daylight savings adjustments are involved.

	o Fix interval display to support values exceeding 2^31 hours
	o Add overflow checking to timestamp and interval arithmetic
	o Extend timezone code to allow 64-bit values so we can
	  represent years beyond 2038

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01363.php

	o Use LC_TIME for localized weekday/month names, rather than
	  LC_MESSAGES

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-11/msg00390.php

	o Add ISO INTERVAL handling

		  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-01/msg00250.php
		  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2006-04/msg00248.php

		o Support ISO INTERVAL syntax if units cannot be determined from
		  the string, and are supplied after the string

		  The SQL standard states that the units after the string
		  specify the units of the string, e.g. INTERVAL '2' MINUTE
		  should return '00:02:00'. The current behavior has the units
		  restrict the interval value to the specified unit or unit
		  range, INTERVAL '70' SECOND returns '00:00:10'.

		  For syntax that isn't uniquely ISO or PG syntax, like '1' or
		  '1:30', treat as ISO if there is a range specification clause,
		  and as PG if there no clause is present, e.g. interpret '1:30'
		  MINUTE TO SECOND as '1 minute 30 seconds', and interpret
		  '1:30' as '1 hour, 30 minutes'.

		  This makes common cases like SELECT INTERVAL '1' MONTH
		  SQL-standard results. The SQL standard supports a limited
		  number of unit combinations and doesn't support unit names in
		  the string. The PostgreSQL syntax is more flexible in the
		  range of units supported, e.g. PostgreSQL supports '1 year 1
		  hour', while the SQL standard does not.

		o Add support for year-month syntax, INTERVAL '50-6' YEAR
		  TO MONTH
		o Interpret INTERVAL '1 year' MONTH as CAST (INTERVAL '1
		  year' AS INTERVAL MONTH), and this should return '12 months'
		o Round or truncate values to the requested precision, e.g.
		  INTERVAL '11 months' AS YEAR should return one or zero
		o Support precision, CREATE TABLE foo (a INTERVAL MONTH(3))


* Arrays

	o Delay resolution of array expression's data type so assignment
	  coercion can be performed on empty array expressions
	o Add support for arrays of domains

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-05/msg00114.php

	o Allow single-byte header storage for array elements


* Binary Data

	o Improve vacuum of large objects, like contrib/vacuumlo?
	o Add security checking for large objects
	o Auto-delete large objects when referencing row is deleted

          contrib/lo offers this functionality.

	o Allow read/write into TOAST values like large objects

	  This requires the TOAST column to be stored EXTERNAL.

	o Add API for 64-bit large object access

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-09/msg00781.php

* MONEY data type

	* Add locale-aware MONEY type, and support multiple currencies

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2005-08/msg01432.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg01181.php

	* MONEY dumps in a locale-specific format making it difficult to
	  restore to a system with a different locale
	* Allow MONEY to be easily cast to/from other numeric data types


Functions
=========

* Allow INET subnet tests using non-constants to be indexed
* Allow to_date() and to_timestamp() accept localized month names
* Fix to_date()-related functions to consistently issue errors

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg00915.php

* Add missing parameter handling in to_char()

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-12/msg00948.php

* Allow substring/replace() to get/set bit values
* Allow to_char() on interval values to accumulate the highest unit
  requested

  Some special format flag would be required to request such
  accumulation.  Such functionality could also be added to EXTRACT.
  Prevent accumulation that crosses the month/day boundary because of
  the uneven number of days in a month.

	o to_char(INTERVAL '1 hour 5 minutes', 'MI') => 65
	o to_char(INTERVAL '43 hours 20 minutes', 'MI' ) => 2600
	o to_char(INTERVAL '43 hours 20 minutes', 'WK:DD:HR:MI') => 0:1:19:20
	o to_char(INTERVAL '3 years 5 months','MM') => 41

* Implement inlining of set-returning functions defined in SQL
* Allow SQL-language functions to return results from RETURNING queries

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00665.php

* Allow SQL-language functions to reference parameters by parameter name

  Currently SQL-language functions can only refer to dollar parameters,
  e.g. $1

* Add SPI_gettypmod() to return the typemod for a TupleDesc
* Enforce typmod for function inputs, function results and parameters for
  spi_prepare'd statements called from PLs

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg01403.php

* Allow holdable cursors in SPI
* Tighten function permission checks

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00568.php

* Fix IS OF so it matches the ISO specification, and add documentation

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2003-08/msg00060.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg00060.php

* Add missing operators for geometric data types

  Some geometric types do not have the full suite of geometric operators,
  e.g. box @> point

* Implement Boyer-Moore searching in strpos()

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-08/msg00012.php

* Prevent malicious functions from being executed with the permissions
  of unsuspecting users

  Index functions are safe, so VACUUM and ANALYZE are safe too. 
  Triggers, CHECK and DEFAULT expressions, and rules are still vulnerable.
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-01/msg00268.php

* Reduce memory usage of aggregates in set returning functions

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2008-01/msg00031.php

* Add temporal versions of generate_series()

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg01180.php



Multi-Language Support
======================

* Add NCHAR (as distinguished from ordinary varchar),
* Allow locale to be set at database creation

  Currently locale can only be set during initdb.  No global tables have
  locale-aware columns.  However, the database template used during
  database creation might have locale-aware indexes.  The indexes would
  need to be reindexed to match the new locale.

* Allow encoding on a per-column basis optionally using the ICU library:

  Right now only one encoding is allowed per database.  [locale]

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-03/msg00932.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-08/msg00309.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-03/msg00233.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg00662.php

* Add CREATE COLLATE?  [locale]
* Support multiple simultaneous character sets, per SQL92
* Improve UTF8 combined character handling?
* Add octet_length_server() and octet_length_client()
* Make octet_length_client() the same as octet_length()?
* Fix problems with wrong runtime encoding conversion for NLS message files
* Add URL to more complete multi-byte regression tests

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-07/msg00272.php

* Fix ILIKE and regular expressions to handle case insensitivity
  properly in multibyte encodings

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2005-10/msg00001.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-11/msg00173.php

* Set client encoding based on the client operating system encoding

  Currently client_encoding is set in postgresql.conf, which
  defaults to the server encoding.
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg01696.php

* Change memory allocation for multi-byte functions so memory is
  allocated inside conversion functions

  Currently we preallocate memory based on worst-case usage.



Views / Rules
=============

* Automatically create rules on views so they are updateable, per SQL99

  We can only auto-create rules for simple views.  For more complex
  cases users will still have to write rules manually.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00586.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-08/msg00255.php

* Add the functionality for WITH CHECK OPTION clause of CREATE VIEW
* Allow NOTIFY in rules involving conditionals
* Allow VIEW/RULE recompilation when the underlying tables change

  Another issue is whether underlying table changes should be reflected
  in the view, e.g. should SELECT * show additional columns if they
  are added after the view is created.

* Make it possible to use RETURNING together with conditional DO INSTEAD
  rules, such as for partitioning setups

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-09/msg00577.php

* Add the ability to automatically create materialized views

  Right now materialized views require the user to create triggers on the
  main table to keep the summary table current.  SQL syntax should be able
  to manager the triggers and summary table automatically.  A more
  sophisticated implementation would automatically retrieve from the
  summary table when the main table is referenced, if possible.



SQL Commands
============

* Add CORRESPONDING BY to UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
* Add ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS options to GROUP BY
* %Allow SET CONSTRAINTS to be qualified by schema/table name
* %Add a separate TRUNCATE permission

  Currently only the owner can TRUNCATE a table because triggers are not
  called, and the table is locked in exclusive mode.

* Allow PREPARE of cursors
* Allow finer control over the caching of prepared query plans

  Currently queries prepared via the libpq API are planned on first
  execute using the supplied parameters --- allow SQL PREPARE to do the
  same.  Also, allow control over replanning prepared queries either
  manually or automatically when statistics for execute parameters
  differ dramatically from those used during planning.

* Improve logging of prepared transactions recovered during startup

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-11/msg00092.php

* Allow LISTEN/NOTIFY to store info in memory rather than tables?

  Currently LISTEN/NOTIFY information is stored in pg_listener. Storing
  such information in memory would improve performance.

* Add optional textual message to NOTIFY

  This would allow an informational message to be added to the notify
  message, perhaps indicating the row modified or other custom
  information.

* Allow multiple identical NOTIFY events to always be communicated to the
  client, rather than sent as a single notification to the listener

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2008-01/msg00057.php

* Add a GUC variable to warn about non-standard SQL usage in queries
* Add SQL-standard MERGE command, typically used to merge two tables
  [merge]

  This is similar to UPDATE, then for unmatched rows, INSERT.
  Whether concurrent access allows modifications which could cause
  row loss is implementation independent.

* Add REPLACE or UPSERT command that does UPDATE, or on failure, INSERT
  [merge]

  To implement this cleanly requires that the table have a unique index
  so duplicate checking can be easily performed.  It is possible to
  do it without a unique index if we require the user to LOCK the table
  before the MERGE.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-11/msg00501.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-11/msg00536.php

* Add NOVICE output level for helpful messages like automatic sequence/index
  creation
* Add GUC to issue notice about statements that use unjoined tables
* Allow EXPLAIN to identify tables that were skipped because of
  constraint_exclusion
* Allow EXPLAIN output to be more easily processed by scripts, perhaps XML
* Enable standard_conforming_strings
* Make standard_conforming_strings the default in 8.5?

  When this is done, backslash-quote should be prohibited in non-E''
  strings because of possible confusion over how such strings treat
  backslashes.  Basically, '' is always safe for a literal single
  quote, while \' might or might not be based on the backslash
  handling rules.

* Simplify dropping roles that have objects in several databases
* Allow COMMENT ON to accept an expression rather than just a string
* Allow the count returned by SELECT, etc to be represented as an int64
  to allow a higher range of values
* Add SQL99 WITH clause to SELECT
* Add SQL:2003 WITH RECURSIVE (hierarchical) queries to SELECT

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg01375.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg00642.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-03/msg00139.php

* Add DEFAULT .. AS OWNER so permission checks are done as the table
  owner

  This would be useful for SERIAL nextval() calls and CHECK constraints.

* Allow DISTINCT to work in multiple-argument aggregate calls
* Add column to pg_stat_activity that shows the progress of long-running
  commands like CREATE INDEX and VACUUM
* Implement SQL:2003 window functions
* Improve failure message when DROP DATABASE is used on a database that
  has prepared transactions
* Allow INSERT/UPDATE ... RETURNING inside a SELECT 'FROM' clause

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2006-09/msg00803.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00693.php

* Increase locking when DROPing objects so dependent objects cannot
  get dropped while the DROP operation is happening

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg00937.php

* -Allow AS in "SELECT col AS label" to be optional in certain cases

* Allow INSERT ... DELETE ... RETURNING, namely allow the DELETE ...
  RETURNING to supply values to the INSERT
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/thrd2.php#00979

* Add comments on system tables/columns using the information in
  catalogs.sgml

  Ideally the information would be pulled from the SGML file
  automatically.


* CREATE

	o Allow CREATE TABLE AS to determine column lengths for complex
	  expressions like SELECT col1 || col2

	o Have WITH CONSTRAINTS also create constraint indexes

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-04/msg00149.php

	o Have CONSTRAINT cname NOT NULL record the contraint name

	  Right now pg_attribute.attnotnull records the NOT NULL status
	  of the column, but does not record the contraint name



* UPDATE
	o Allow UPDATE tab SET ROW (col, ...) = (SELECT...)

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-07/msg01306.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg00865.php

	o Research self-referential UPDATEs that see inconsistent row versions
	  in read-committed mode

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-05/msg00507.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-06/msg00016.php

	o Allow GLOBAL temporary tables to exist as empty by default in
	  all sessions

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-07/msg00006.php


* ALTER

	o Have ALTER TABLE RENAME rename SERIAL sequence names

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-03/msg00008.php

	o Have ALTER SEQUENCE RENAME rename the sequence name stored
	  in the sequence table

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-09/msg00092.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-10/msg00007.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-03/msg00008.php

	o Add ALTER DOMAIN to modify the underlying data type
	o %Allow ALTER TABLE ... ALTER CONSTRAINT ... RENAME

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-02/msg00168.php

	o %Allow ALTER TABLE to change constraint deferrability and actions
	o Add missing object types for ALTER ... SET SCHEMA
	o Allow ALTER TABLESPACE to move to different directories
	o Allow databases to be moved to different tablespaces
	o Allow moving system tables to other tablespaces, where possible

	  Currently non-global system tables must be in the default database
	  tablespace. Global system tables can never be moved.

	o Prevent parent tables from altering or dropping constraints
	  like CHECK that are inherited by child tables unless CASCADE
	  is used
	o %Prevent child tables from altering or dropping constraints
          like CHECK that were inherited from the parent table
	o Have ALTER INDEX update the name of a constraint using that index
	o Add ALTER TABLE RENAME CONSTRAINT, update index name also
	o Allow column display reordering by recording a display,
	  storage, and permanent id for every column?

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00782.php



* CLUSTER

	o Automatically maintain clustering on a table

	  This might require some background daemon to maintain clustering
	  during periods of low usage. It might also require tables to be only
	  partially filled for easier reorganization.  Another idea would
          be to create a merged heap/index data file so an index lookup would
	  automatically access the heap data too.  A third idea would be to
	  store heap rows in hashed groups, perhaps using a user-supplied
	  hash function.
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2004-08/msg00349.php

	o %Add default clustering to system tables

	  To do this, determine the ideal cluster index for each system
	  table and set the cluster setting during initdb.

	o %Add VERBOSE option to report tables as they are processed,
	  like VACUUM VERBOSE


* COPY

	o Allow COPY to report error lines and continue

	  This requires the use of a savepoint before each COPY line is
	  processed, with ROLLBACK on COPY failure.

	o Allow COPY on a newly-created table to skip WAL logging

	  On crash recovery, the table involved in the COPY would
	  be removed or have its heap and index files truncated.  One
	  issue is that no other backend should be able to add to
	  the table at the same time, which is something that is
	  currently allowed.  This currently is done if the table is
	  created inside the same transaction block as the COPY because
	  no other backends can see the table.

	o Consider using a ring buffer for COPY FROM

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2008-02/msg00140.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg01080.php

	o Allow COPY FROM to create index entries in bulk

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg00811.php



* GRANT/REVOKE

	o Allow column-level privileges
	o %Allow GRANT/REVOKE permissions to be applied to all schema objects
	  with one command

	  The proposed syntax is:
		GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN public TO phpuser;
		GRANT SELECT ON NEW TABLES IN public TO phpuser;

	o Allow GRANT/REVOKE permissions to be inherited by objects based on
	  schema permissions

	o Allow SERIAL sequences to inherit permissions from the base table?


* CURSOR

	o Prevent DROP TABLE from dropping a row referenced by its own open
	  cursor?


* INSERT

	o Allow INSERT/UPDATE of the system-generated oid value for a row
	o In rules, allow VALUES() to contain a mixture of 'old' and 'new'
	  references


* SHOW/SET

	o Add SET PERFORMANCE_TIPS option to suggest INDEX, VACUUM, VACUUM
	  ANALYZE, and CLUSTER



Referential Integrity
=====================

* Add MATCH PARTIAL referential integrity
* Change foreign key constraint for array -> element to mean element
  in array?
* Fix problem when cascading referential triggers make changes on
  cascaded tables, seeing the tables in an intermediate state

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-09/msg00174.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-09/msg00174.php

* Allow DEFERRABLE and end-of-statement UNIQUE constraints?

  This would allow UPDATE tab SET col = col + 1 to work if col has
  a unique index.  Currently, uniqueness checks are done while the
  command is being executed, rather than at the end of the statement
  or transaction.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01458.php

* Optimize referential integrity checks

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2005-10/msg00458.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00744.php


Server-Side Languages
=====================

* PL/pgSQL
	o Fix RENAME to work on variables other than OLD/NEW

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2002-03/msg00591.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg01615.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg01587.php

	o Allow function parameters to be passed by name,
	  get_employee_salary(12345 AS emp_id, 2001 AS tax_year)
	o Allow handling of %TYPE arrays, e.g. tab.col%TYPE[]
	o Allow listing of record column names, and access to
	  record columns via variables, e.g. columns := r.(*),
	  tval2 := r.(colname)

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00458.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-05/msg00302.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00031.php

	o Add support for SCROLL cursors
	o Add support for WITH HOLD cursors
	o Allow row and record variables to be set to NULL constants,
	  and allow NULL tests on such variables

	  Because a row is not scalar, do not allow assignment
	  from NULL-valued scalars.

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00070.php

	o Review handling of MOVE and FETCH

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-04/msg00527.php


* Other
	o Add table function support to pltcl, plpythonu
	o Add support for polymorphic arguments and return types to
	  languages other than PL/PgSQL
	o Add capability to create and call PROCEDURES
	o Add support for OUT and INOUT parameters to languages other
	  than PL/PgSQL
	o Add PL/PythonU tracebacks

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-02/msg00288.php

	o Allow data to be passed in native language formats, rather
	  than only text

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-05/msg00289.php



Clients
=======

* Have pg_ctl look at PGHOST in case it is a socket directory?
* Allow pg_ctl to work properly with configuration files located outside
  the PGDATA directory

  pg_ctl can not read the pid file because it isn't located in the
  config directory but in the PGDATA directory.  The solution is to
  allow pg_ctl to read and understand postgresql.conf to find the
  data_directory value.

* Add a function like pg_get_indexdef() that report more detailed index
  information

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-12/msg00166.php

* Prefix command-line utilities like createuser with 'pg_'

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-06/msg00025.php


* psql
	o Have psql show current values for a sequence
	o Move psql backslash database information into the backend, use
	  mnemonic commands? [psql]

	  This would allow non-psql clients to pull the same information out
	  of the database as psql.

	o Fix psql's \d commands more consistent

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-11/msg00014.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-11/msg00014.php

	o Consistently display privilege information for all objects in psql
	o Add auto-expanded mode so expanded output is used if the row
	  length is wider than the screen width.

	  Consider using auto-expanded mode for backslash commands like \df+.

	o Prevent tab completion of SET TRANSACTION from querying the
	  database and therefore preventing the transaction isolation
	  level from being set.

	  Currently SET <tab> causes a database lookup to check all
	  supported session variables.  This query causes problems
	  because setting the transaction isolation level must be the
	  first statement of a transaction.

	o Add a \set variable to control whether \s displays line numbers

	  Another option is to add \# which lists line numbers, and
	  allows command execution.

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00255.php

	o Prevent escape string warnings when object names have
	  backslashes

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-01/msg00227.php

	o Have \d show foreign keys that reference a table's primary key

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00424.php

	o Have \d show child tables that inherit from the specified parent
	o Have \l+ show database size, if permissions allow

	  Ideally it will not generate an error for invalid permissions



* pg_dump / pg_restore
	o %Add dumping of comments on index columns and composite type columns
	o %Add full object name to the tag field.  eg. for operators we need
	  '=(integer, integer)', instead of just '='.
	o Add pg_dumpall custom format dumps?
	o Allow selection of individual object(s) of all types, not just
	  tables
	o In a selective dump, allow dumping of an object and all its
	  dependencies
	o Add options like pg_restore -l and -L to pg_dump
	o Stop dumping CASCADE on DROP TYPE commands in clean mode
	o Allow pg_dump --clean to drop roles that own objects or have
	  privileges
	o Change pg_dump so that a comment on the dumped database is
	  applied to the loaded database, even if the database has a
	  different name.  This will require new backend syntax, perhaps
	  COMMENT ON CURRENT DATABASE.
	o Remove unnecessary function pointer abstractions in pg_dump source
	  code
	o Allow pg_dump to utilize multiple CPUs and I/O channels by dumping
	  multiple objects simultaneously

	  The difficulty with this is getting multiple dump processes to
	  produce a single dump output file.  It also would require
	  several sessions to share the same snapshot.
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg00205.php

	o Allow pg_restore to utilize multiple CPUs and I/O channels by
          restoring multiple objects simultaneously

	  This might require a pg_restore flag to indicate how many
	  simultaneous operations should be performed.  Only pg_dump's
	  -Fc format has the necessary dependency information.
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg00963.php

	o To better utilize resources, allow pg_restore to check foreign
	  keys simultaneously, where possible
	o Allow pg_restore to create all indexes of a table
	  concurrently, via a single heap scan

	  This requires a pg_dump -Fc file because that format contains
          the required dependency information.
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-05/msg01274.php

	o Allow pg_restore to load different parts of the COPY data
	  simultaneously
	o Prevent pg_dump/pg_restore from being affected by
	  statement_timeout

	  Using psql to restore a pg_dump dump is also affected.


* ecpg
	o Docs

	  Document differences between ecpg and the SQL standard and
	  information about the Informix-compatibility module.

	o Solve cardinality > 1 for input descriptors / variables?
	o Add a semantic check level, e.g. check if a table really exists
	o fix handling of DB attributes that are arrays
	o Use backend PREPARE/EXECUTE facility for ecpg where possible
	o Implement SQLDA
	o Fix nested C comments
	o %sqlwarn[6] should be 'W' if the PRECISION or SCALE value specified
	o Make SET CONNECTION thread-aware, non-standard?
	o Allow multidimensional arrays
	o Add internationalized message strings
	o Implement COPY FROM STDIN


* libpq
	o Add PQescapeIdentifierConn()
	o Prevent PQfnumber() from lowercasing unquoted the column name

	  PQfnumber() should never have been doing lowercasing, but
	  historically it has so we need a way to prevent it

	o Allow statement results to be automatically batched to the client

	  Currently all statement results are transferred to the libpq
	  client before libpq makes the results available to the
	  application.  This feature would allow the application to make
	  use of the first result rows while the rest are transferred, or
	  held on the server waiting for them to be requested by libpq.
	  One complexity is that a statement like SELECT 1/col could error
	  out mid-way through the result set.

	o Consider disallowing multiple queries in PQexec() as an
	  additional barrier to SQL injection attacks

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg00184.php

	o Add PQexecf() that allows complex parameter substitution

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg01803.php

	o Add SQLSTATE severity to PGconn return status

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-interfaces/2007-11/msg00015.php


Triggers
========

* Add deferred trigger queue file

  Right now all deferred trigger information is stored in backend
  memory.  This could exhaust memory for very large trigger queues.
  This item involves dumping large queues into files.

* Allow triggers to be disabled in only the current session.

  This is currently possible by starting a multi-statement transaction,
  modifying the system tables, performing the desired SQL, restoring the
  system tables, and committing the transaction.  ALTER TABLE ...
  TRIGGER requires a table lock so it is not ideal for this usage.

* With disabled triggers, allow pg_dump to use ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY

  If the dump is known to be valid, allow foreign keys to be added
  without revalidating the data.

* Allow statement-level triggers to access modified rows
* Support triggers on columns

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00107.php

* Allow AFTER triggers on system tables

  System tables are modified in many places in the backend without going
  through the executor and therefore not causing triggers to fire. To
  complete this item, the functions that modify system tables will have
  to fire triggers.

* Tighten trigger permission checks

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00564.php

* Allow BEFORE INSERT triggers on views

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-02/msg01466.php

* Add ability to trigger on TRUNCATE

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-sql/2008-01/msg00050.php



Indexes
=======

* Add UNIQUE capability to non-btree indexes
* Prevent index uniqueness checks when UPDATE does not modify the column

  Uniqueness (index) checks are done when updating a column even if the
  column is not modified by the UPDATE.

* Allow the creation of on-disk bitmap indexes which can be quickly
  combined with other bitmap indexes

  Such indexes could be more compact if there are only a few distinct values.
  Such indexes can also be compressed.  Keeping such indexes updated can be
  costly.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00512.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg01107.php

* Allow accurate statistics to be collected on indexes with more than
  one column or expression indexes, perhaps using per-index statistics

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2006-10/msg00222.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg01131.php

* Consider increasing the number of default statistics target, and
  reduce statistics target overhead

  Also consider having a larger statistics target for indexed columns
  and expression indexes
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-05/msg01228.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-06/msg00542.php

* Consider compressing indexes by storing key values duplicated in
  several rows as a single index entry

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00341.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg01264.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg00465.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-03/msg00163.php

* Add REINDEX CONCURRENTLY, like CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY

  This is difficult because you must upgrade to an exclusive table lock
  to replace the existing index file.  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY does not
  have this complication.  This would allow index compaction without
  downtime.

* Allow multiple indexes to be created concurrently, ideally via a
  single heap scan, and have pg_restore use it



* Inheritance

	o Allow inherited tables to inherit indexes, UNIQUE constraints,
	  and primary/foreign keys
	o Honor UNIQUE INDEX on base column in INSERTs/UPDATEs
	  on inherited table, e.g.  INSERT INTO inherit_table
	  (unique_index_col) VALUES (dup) should fail

	  The main difficulty with this item is the problem of
	  creating an index that can span multiple tables.

	o Allow SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on inherited tables
	o Require all CHECK constraints to be inherited

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-04/msg00026.php


* GIST

	o Add more GIST index support for geometric data types
	o Allow GIST indexes to create certain complex index types, like
	  digital trees (see Aoki)


* Hash

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-09/msg00051.php

	o Pack hash index buckets onto disk pages more efficiently

	  Currently only one hash bucket can be stored on a page. Ideally
	  several hash buckets could be stored on a single page and greater
	  granularity used for the hash algorithm.

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-06/msg00168.php

	o Consider sorting hash buckets so entries can be found using a
	  binary search, rather than a linear scan
	o In hash indexes, consider storing the hash value with or instead
	  of the key itself
	o Add WAL logging for crash recovery
	o Allow multi-column hash indexes
	o During index creation, pre-sort the tuples to improve build speed

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg01199.php



Fsync
=====

* Determine optimal fdatasync/fsync, O_SYNC/O_DSYNC options

  Ideally this requires a separate test program that can be run
  at initdb time or optionally later.  Consider O_SYNC when
  O_DIRECT exists.

* Add program to test if fsync has a delay compared to non-fsync
* Consider sorting writes during checkpoint

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-06/msg00541.php



Cache Usage
===========

* Speed up COUNT(*)

  We could use a fixed row count and a +/- count to follow MVCC
  visibility rules, or a single cached value could be used and
  invalidated if anyone modifies the table.  Another idea is to
  get a count directly from a unique index, but for this to be
  faster than a sequential scan it must avoid access to the heap
  to obtain tuple visibility information.

* Provide a way to calculate an "estimated COUNT(*)"

  Perhaps by using the optimizer's cardinality estimates or random
  sampling.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-11/msg00943.php

* Allow data to be pulled directly from indexes

  Currently indexes do not have enough tuple visibility information
  to allow data to be pulled from the index without also accessing
  the heap.  One way to allow this is to set a bit on index tuples
  to indicate if a tuple is currently visible to all transactions
  when the first valid heap lookup happens.  This bit would have to
  be cleared when a heap tuple is expired.

  Another idea is to maintain a bitmap of heap pages where all rows
  are visible to all backends, and allow index lookups to reference
  that bitmap to avoid heap lookups, perhaps the same bitmap we might
  add someday to determine which heap pages need vacuuming.  Frequently
  accessed bitmaps would have to be stored in shared memory.  One 8k
  page of bitmaps could track 512MB of heap pages.

  A third idea would be for a heap scan to check if all rows are visible
  and if so set a per-table flag which can be checked by index scans. 
  Any change to the table would have to clear the flag.  To detect
  changes during the heap scan a counter could be set at the start and
  checked at the end --- if it is the same, the table has not been
  modified --- any table change would increment the counter.

* Consider automatic caching of statements at various levels:

	o Parsed query tree
	o Query execute plan
	o Query results

* Consider increasing internal areas when shared buffers is increased

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-10/msg01419.php

* Consider decreasing the amount of memory used by PrivateRefCount

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-11/msg00797.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg00752.php

* Consider allowing higher priority queries to have referenced buffer
  cache pages stay in memory longer

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-11/msg00562.php



Vacuum
======

* Improve speed with indexes

  For large table adjustments during VACUUM FULL, it is faster to cluster
  or reindex rather than update the index.  Also, index updates can bloat
  the index.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg00024.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2007-05/msg00296.php

* Auto-fill the free space map by scanning the buffer cache or by
  checking pages written by the background writer

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-02/msg01125.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00011.php

* Create a bitmap of pages that need vacuuming

  Instead of sequentially scanning the entire table, have the background
  writer or some other process record pages that have expired rows, then
  VACUUM can look at just those pages rather than the entire table.  In
  the event of a system crash, the bitmap would probably be invalidated.
  One complexity is that index entries still have to be vacuumed, and
  doing this without an index scan (by using the heap values to find the
  index entry) might be slow and unreliable, especially for user-defined
  index functions.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg01188.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg00121.php

* Allow FSM to return free space toward the beginning of the heap file,
  in hopes that empty pages at the end can be truncated by VACUUM
* Allow FSM page return free space based on table clustering, to assist
  in maintaining clustering?
* Improve dead row detection during multi-statement transactions usage

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-03/msg00358.php

* Consider a more compact data representation for dead tuples

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-05/msg00143.php


* Auto-vacuum

	o %Issue log message to suggest VACUUM FULL if a table is nearly
	  empty?
	o Improve control of auto-vacuum

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00876.php

	o Prevent long-lived temporary tables from causing frozen-xid
	  advancement starvation

	  The problem is that autovacuum cannot vacuum them to set frozen xids;
	  only the session that created them can do that.
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-06/msg01645.php

	o Store per-table autovacuum settings in pg_class.reloptions.

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg01440.php
	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-01/msg00724.php

	o Prevent autovacuum from running if an old transaction is still
	  running from the last vacuum

	  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-11/msg00899.php



Locking
=======

* Fix priority ordering of read and write light-weight locks (Neil)

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-11/msg00893.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-11/msg00905.php

* Fix problem when multiple subtransactions of the same outer transaction
  hold different types of locks, and one subtransaction aborts

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-11/msg01011.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg00001.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg00435.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-05/msg00773.php

* Allow UPDATEs on only non-referential integrity columns not to conflict
  with referential integrity locks

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg00073.php

* Add idle_in_transaction_timeout GUC so locks are not held for long
  periods of time

* Improve deadlock detection when a page cleaning lock conflicts
  with a shared buffer that is pinned

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2008-01/msg00138.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-01/msg00873.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/2008-01/msg00365.php




Startup Time Improvements
=========================

* Experiment with multi-threaded backend for backend creation [thread]

  This would prevent the overhead associated with process creation. Most
  operating systems have trivial process creation time compared to
  database startup overhead, but a few operating systems (Win32,
  Solaris) might benefit from threading.  Also explore the idea of
  a single session using multiple threads to execute a statement faster.



Write-Ahead Log
===============

* Eliminate need to write full pages to WAL before page modification [wal]

  Currently, to protect against partial disk page writes, we write
  full page images to WAL before they are modified so we can correct any
  partial page writes during recovery.  These pages can also be
  eliminated from point-in-time archive files.

	o  When off, write CRC to WAL and check file system blocks
	   on recovery

	   If CRC check fails during recovery, remember the page in case
	   a later CRC for that page properly matches.

	o  Write full pages during file system write and not when
	   the page is modified in the buffer cache

	   This allows most full page writes to happen in the background
	   writer.  It might cause problems for applying WAL on recovery
	   into a partially-written page, but later the full page will be
	   replaced from WAL.

* Allow WAL traffic to be streamed to another server for stand-by
  replication
* Reduce WAL traffic so only modified values are written rather than
  entire rows

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-03/msg01589.php

* Allow WAL information to recover corrupted pg_controldata

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00025.php

* Find a way to reduce rotational delay when repeatedly writing
  last WAL page

  Currently fsync of WAL requires the disk platter to perform a full
  rotation to fsync again. One idea is to write the WAL to different
  offsets that might reduce the rotational delay.

* Allow WAL logging to be turned off for a table, but the table
  might be dropped or truncated during crash recovery [walcontrol]

  Allow tables to bypass WAL writes and just fsync() dirty pages on
  commit.  This should be implemented using ALTER TABLE, e.g. ALTER
  TABLE PERSISTENCE [ DROP | TRUNCATE | DEFAULT ].  Tables using
  non-default logging should not use referential integrity with
  default-logging tables.  A table without dirty buffers during a
  crash could perhaps avoid the drop/truncate.

* Allow WAL logging to be turned off for a table, but the table would
  avoid being truncated/dropped [walcontrol]

  To do this, only a single writer can modify the table, and writes
  must happen only on new pages so the new pages can be removed during
  crash recovery.  Readers can continue accessing the table.  Such
  tables probably cannot have indexes.  One complexity is the handling
  of indexes on TOAST tables.

* Speed WAL recovery by allowing more than one page to be prefetched

  This involves having a separate process that can be told which pages
  the recovery process will need in the near future.
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-02/msg01279.php



Optimizer / Executor
====================

* Improve selectivity functions for geometric operators
* Precompile SQL functions to avoid overhead
* Create utility to compute accurate random_page_cost value
* Improve ability to display optimizer analysis using OPTIMIZER_DEBUG
* Have EXPLAIN ANALYZE issue NOTICE messages when the estimated and
  actual row counts differ by a specified percentage
* Consider using hash buckets to do DISTINCT, rather than sorting

  This would be beneficial when there are few distinct values.  This is
  already used by GROUP BY.

* Log statements where the optimizer row estimates were dramatically
  different from the number of rows actually found?
* Consider compressed annealing to search for query plans

  This might replace GEQO, http://sixdemonbag.org/Djinni.

* Improve merge join performance by allowing mark/restore of
  tuple sources

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-01/msg00096.php

* Consider using a hash for joining to a large IN (VALUES ...) list

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-05/msg00450.php



Miscellaneous Performance
=========================

* Do async I/O for faster random read-ahead of data

  Async I/O allows multiple I/O requests to be sent to the disk with
  results coming back asynchronously.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00820.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-12/msg00027.php

* Use mmap() rather than SYSV shared memory or to write WAL files?

  This would remove the requirement for SYSV SHM but would introduce
  portability issues. Anonymous mmap (or mmap to /dev/zero) is required
  to prevent I/O overhead.

* Consider mmap()'ing files into a backend?

  Doing I/O to large tables would consume a lot of address space or
  require frequent mapping/unmapping.  Extending the file also causes
  mapping problems that might require mapping only individual pages,
  leading to thousands of mappings.  Another problem is that there is no
  way to _prevent_ I/O to disk from the dirty shared buffers so changes
  could hit disk before WAL is written.

* Add a script to ask system configuration questions and tune postgresql.conf
* Consider ways of storing rows more compactly on disk

	o Reduce the row header size?
	o Consider reducing on-disk varlena length from four bytes to
	  two because a heap row cannot be more than 64k in length

* Consider increasing NUM_CLOG_BUFFERS
* Consider having the background writer update the transaction status
  hint bits before writing out the page

  Implementing this requires the background writer to have access to system
  catalogs and the transaction status log.

* Consider adding buffers the BGW finds reusable to the free list 

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00781.php

* Automatically tune bgwriter_delay based on activity rather then using a
  fixed interval

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-04/msg00781.php

* Allow user configuration of TOAST thresholds

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2007-02/msg00213.php

* Allow configuration of backend priorities via the operating system

  Though backend priorities make priority inversion during lock
  waits possible, research shows that this is not a huge problem.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2007-02/msg00493.php

* Experiment with multi-threaded backend better resource utilization

  This would allow a single query to make use of multiple CPU's or
  multiple I/O channels simultaneously.  One idea is to create a
  background reader that can pre-fetch sequential and index scan
  pages needed by other backends.  This could be expanded to allow
  concurrent reads from multiple devices in a partitioned table.

* Consider increasing the minimum allowed number of shared buffers

  read them properly
* Update Bonjour to work with newer cross-platform SDK

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg02238.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-10/msg00048.php

* Consider detoasting keys before sorting
* Consider GnuTLS if OpenSSL license becomes a problem

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-05/msg00040.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-12/msg01213.php

* Consider changing documentation format from SGML to XML

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-docs/2006-12/msg00152.php

* Consider making NAMEDATALEN more configurable in future releases
* Update our code to handle 64-bit timezone files to match the zic
  source code, which now uses them
* Have configure choose integer datetimes by default

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2007-05/msg00046.php

	o Update clients to use data types, typmod, schema.table.column names
	  of result sets using new statement protocol


Exotic Features
===============

* Add pre-parsing phase that converts non-ISO syntax to supported
  syntax

  This could allow SQL written for other databases to run without
  modification.

* Allow plug-in modules to emulate features from other databases
* Add features of Oracle-style packages  (Pavel)

  A package would be a schema with session-local variables,
  public/private functions, and initialization functions.  It
  is also possible to implement these capabilities
  in any schema and not use a separate "packages"
  syntax at all.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00384.php

* Consider allowing control of upper/lower case folding of unquoted
  identifiers

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2004-04/msg00818.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg01527.php

* Add autonomous transactions

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-01/msg00893.php



Features We Do _Not_ Want
=========================

* All backends running as threads in a single process (not wanted)

  This eliminates the process protection we get from the current setup.
  Thread creation is usually the same overhead as process creation on
  modern systems, so it seems unwise to use a pure threaded model.

* Optimizer hints (not wanted)

  Optimizer hints are used to work around problems in the optimizer.  We
  would rather have the problems reported and fixed.

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00506.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00517.php
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00663.php


  Because we support postfix operators, it isn't possible to make AS
  optional and continue to use bison.
  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2003-04/msg00436.php

  http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-sql/2006-08/msg00164.php

* Embedded server (not wanted)

  While PostgreSQL clients runs fine in limited-resource environments, the
  server requires multiple processes and a stable pool of resources to
  run reliabily and efficiently.  Stripping down the PostgreSQL server
  to run in the same process address space as the client application
  would add too much complexity and failure cases.
