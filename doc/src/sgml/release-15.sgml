      Prevent unauthorized code execution
      during <application>pg_dump</application> (Masahiko Sawada)
     </para>

     <para>
      An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could
      inject SQL code that would be executed by a
      concurrent <application>pg_dump</application> session with the
      privileges of the role running <application>pg_dump</application>
      (which is often a superuser).  The attack involves replacing a
      sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will
      execute malicious code.  To prevent this, introduce a new server
      parameter <varname>restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind</varname> that
      can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to
      foreign tables, and teach <application>pg_dump</application> to set
      it when available.  Note that the attack is prevented only if
      both <application>pg_dump</application> and the server it is dumping
      from are new enough to have this fix.

      Fix <command>ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION</command> for cases
      involving inconsistent index-based constraints
      (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera, Tender Wang)
     </para>

     <para>
      When a partitioned table has an index that is not associated with a
      constraint, but a partition has an equivalent index that is, then
      detaching the partition would misbehave, leaving the ex-partition's
      constraint with an incorrect <structfield>coninhcount</structfield>
      value.  This would cause trouble during any further manipulations of
      that constraint.

     </para>

     <para>
      An in-place update occurring while we expand out-of-line fields in a
      catalog tuple could be missed, leading to a catalog cache entry that
      lacks the in-place change but is not known to be stale.  This is
      only possible in the <structname>pg_database</structname> catalog,
      so the effects are narrow, but misbehavior is possible.

      It's possible for a transaction to execute an operation that queues
      a deferred <literal>AFTER</literal> trigger for later execution, and
      then to drop the trigger before that happens.  Formerly this led to
      weird errors such as <quote>could not find

      silently do nothing if the trigger no longer exists at the time when
      it would have been executed.

      Avoid possibly missing end-of-input events on Windows sockets
      (Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      Windows reports an FD_CLOSE event only once after the remote end of
      the connection disconnects.  With unlucky timing, we could miss that
      report and wait indefinitely, or at least until a timeout elapsed,
      expecting more input.

      Fix buffer overread in JSON parse error reports for incomplete byte
      sequences (Jacob Champion)
     </para>

     <para>
      It was possible to walk off the end of the input buffer by a few
      bytes when the last bytes comprise an incomplete multi-byte
      character.  While usually harmless, in principle this could cause a
      crash.

      Restrict visibility of <structname>pg_stats_ext</structname> and

     </para>

     <para>
      These views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve
      columns the accessing user does not have permission to read.  View
      columns such as <structfield>most_common_vals</structfield> might
      expose security-relevant data.  The potential interactions here are
      not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety,
      make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated
      table.

     </para>

     <para>
      By itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      database clusters.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing
      cluster, you will need to do the following:
     </para>

     <procedure>
      <step>
       <para>
        Find the SQL script <filename>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</filename> in
        the <replaceable>share</replaceable> directory of
        the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation (typically
        located someplace like <filename>/usr/share/postgresql/</filename>).
        Be sure to use the script appropriate to
        your <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> major version.
        If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable
        (only v14&ndash;v16 are affected) or your minor version is too
        old to have the fix.
       </para>
      </step>

      <step>
       <para>
        In <emphasis>each</emphasis> database of the cluster, run
        the <filename>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</filename> script as superuser.
        In <application>psql</application> this would look like
<programlisting>
\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql
</programlisting>
        (adjust the file path as appropriate).  Any error probably indicates
        that you've used the wrong script version.  It will not hurt to run
        the script more than once.
       </para>
      </step>

      <step>
       <para>
        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</literal>
        and <literal>template1</literal> databases, or the vulnerability
        will still exist in databases you create later.  To
        fix <literal>template0</literal>, you'll need to temporarily make
        it accept connections.  Do that with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</literal>, undo it with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

      Avoid deadlock during removal of orphaned temporary tables

     <para>
      If the session that creates a temporary table crashes without
      removing the table, autovacuum will eventually try to remove the
      orphaned table.  However, an incoming session that's been assigned
      the same temporary namespace will do that too.  If a temporary table
      has a dependency (such as an owned sequence) then a deadlock could
      result between these two cleanup attempts.

      The output columns of such a function call must be defined by
      an <literal>AS</literal> clause that specifies the column names and
      data types.  If the actual function output value doesn't match that,
      an error is supposed to be thrown at runtime.  However, some code

      issue strange errors or suffer assertion failures if it doesn't
      match expectations.

      Tighten security restrictions within <command>REFRESH MATERIALIZED
      VIEW CONCURRENTLY</command> (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
      restrictions.  If a materialized view's owner could persuade a
      superuser or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent
      refresh on that view, the view's owner could control code executed
      with the privileges of the user running <command>REFRESH</command>.
      Fix things so that all user-determined code is run as the view's
      owner, as expected.
     </para>

      The only known exploit for this error does not work

      out-of-memory conditions after sufficiently many JIT compilations.
      This fix should resolve that.

      Prevent access to a no-longer-pinned buffer in <literal>BEFORE ROW
      UPDATE</literal> triggers (Alexander Lakhin, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the tuple being updated had just been updated and moved to
      another page by another session, there was a narrow window where
      we would attempt to fetch data from the new tuple version without
      any pin on its buffer.  In principle this could result in garbage
      data appearing in non-updated columns of the proposed new tuple.
      The odds of problems in practice seem rather low, however.

      Detect that a new catalog cache entry became stale while detoasting
      its fields (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      We expand any out-of-line fields in a catalog tuple before inserting
      it into the catalog caches.  That involves database access which
      might cause invalidation of catalog cache entries &mdash; but the
      new entry isn't in the cache yet, so we would miss noticing that it
      should get invalidated.  The result is a race condition in which an
      already-stale cache entry could get made, and then persist
      indefinitely.  This would lead to hard-to-predict misbehavior.
      Fix by rechecking the tuple's visibility after detoasting.

      Prevent standby servers from incorrectly processing dead index
      tuples during subtransactions (Fei Changhong)
     </para>

     <para>
      The <structfield>startedInRecovery</structfield> flag was not
      correctly set for a subtransaction.  This affects only processing of
      dead index tuples.  It could allow a query in a subtransaction to
      ignore index entries that it should return (if they are already dead
      on the primary server, but not dead to the standby transaction), or
      to prematurely mark index entries as dead that are not yet dead on
      the primary.  It is not clear that the latter case has any serious
      consequences, but it's not the intended behavior.

      Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during

     <para>
      If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies
      system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to
      fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.
      This fix deals with the case that a top-level transaction is already
      marked as containing catalog changes, but its subtransaction(s) are
      not.

      The pipeline state could get out of sync if an error is returned
      for reasons other than a query problem (for example, if the

      considered as internal affairs of the extension.  Moreover, the
      restoring user might not have adequate privilege to set them, and
      indeed the dumping user might not have enough privilege to dump them
      (since dumping RLS policies requires acquiring lock on their table).

     <para>
      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in
      edge cases.  Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for
      arbitrary code execution are possible, and so is disclosure of
      server memory.

      Prevent the <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal> role from
      signalling background workers and autovacuum processes
      (Noah Misch, Jelte Fennema-Nio)
     </para>

     <para>
      The documentation says that <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal>
      cannot issue signals to superuser-owned processes.  It was able to
      signal these background processes, though, because they advertise a
      role OID of zero.  Treat that as indicating superuser ownership.
      The security implications of cancelling one of these process types
      are fairly small so far as the core code goes (we'll just start
      another one), but extensions might add background workers that are
      more vulnerable.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also ensure that the <varname>is_superuser</varname> parameter is
      set correctly in such processes.  No specific security consequences
      are known for that oversight, but it might be significant for some
      extensions.

      Prevent de-duplication of btree index entries

     <para>
      There are <type>interval</type> values that are distinguishable but

      and <literal>1 day</literal>.  This breaks assumptions made by btree
      de-duplication, so <type>interval</type> columns need to be excluded
      from de-duplication.  This oversight can cause incorrect results
      from index-only scans.  Moreover, after
      updating <application>amcheck</application> will report an error for
      almost all such indexes.  Users should reindex any btree indexes

      values more sanely in
      BRIN <literal>datetime_minmax_multi_ops</literal> indexes
      (Tomas Vondra)

     <para>
      Infinities were mistakenly treated as having distance zero rather
      than a large distance from other values, causing poor decisions
      about which entries to merge.  Also, finite-but-very-large values
      (near the endpoints of the representable timestamp range) could
      result in internal overflows, again causing poor decisions.  The
      index still produces correct results, but is much less efficient
      than it should be.  Reindexing BRIN <literal>minmax_multi</literal>
      indexes on <type>timestamp</type> and <type>timestamptz</type>
      columns is advisable if the column contains, or has contained,
      infinities or large finite values.

      Fix edge case in btree mark/restore processing of ScalarArrayOpExpr
      clauses (Peter Geoghegan)
     </para>

     <para>
      When restoring an indexscan to a previously marked position, the
      code could miss required setup steps if the scan had advanced
      exactly to the end of the matches for a ScalarArrayOpExpr (that is,
      an <literal>indexcol = ANY(ARRAY[])</literal>) clause.  This could
      result in missing some rows that should have been fetched.

     <para>
      Presence of this abbreviation in the default list can cause failures
      on recent Debian and Ubuntu releases, as they no longer install the
      underlying tzdb entry by default.  Since this is a made-up
      abbreviation for a zone with a total human population of about two
      dozen, it seems unlikely that anyone will miss it.  If someone does,
      they can put it back via a custom abbreviations file.

      Fix <command>MERGE</command> to enforce row security policies
      properly (Dean Rasheed)
     </para>

     <para>
      When <command>MERGE</command> performs an <literal>UPDATE</literal>
      action, it should enforce any <literal>UPDATE</literal> or
      <literal>SELECT</literal> RLS policies defined on the target table,
      to be consistent with the way that a plain <command>UPDATE</command>
      with a <literal>WHERE</literal> clause works.  Instead it was
      enforcing <literal>INSERT</literal> RLS policies for both
      <literal>INSERT</literal> and <literal>UPDATE</literal> actions.
     </para>

     <para>
      In addition, when <command>MERGE</command> performs a <literal>DO

      Fix confusion between empty (no rows) ranges and all-NULL ranges in

      (Tomas Vondra)
     </para>

      Each of these oversights could result in forgetting that a BRIN

      Avoid leaving a corrupted database behind when <command>DROP
      DATABASE</command> is interrupted (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      If <command>DROP DATABASE</command> was interrupted after it had
      already begun taking irreversible steps, the target database
      remained accessible (because the removal of
      its <structname>pg_database</structname> row would roll back),
      but it would have corrupt contents.  Fix by marking the database
      as inaccessible before we begin to perform irreversible operations.
      A failure after that will leave the database still partially
      present, but nothing can be done with it except to issue
      another <command>DROP DATABASE</command>.

     <para>
      While an unlogged index's main data fork is not WAL-logged, its init
      fork should be, to ensure that we have a consistent state to restore
      the index to after a crash.  This step was missed if the init fork
      contains no data, which is a case not used by any standard index AM;
      but perhaps some extension behaves that way.

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling
      query, those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some
      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role.

      Disallow altering composite types that are stored in indexes
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <command>ALTER TYPE</command> disallows non-binary-compatible
      modifications of composite types if they are stored in any table
      columns.  (Perhaps that will be allowed someday, but it hasn't
      happened yet; the locking implications of rewriting many tables are
      daunting.)  We overlooked the possibility that an index might
      contain a composite type that doesn't also appear in its table.

      Since the removal of OID as a system column, there is no plausible

      Disallow it rather than trying to fix all the cases.

     <para>
      Most cases in which a syntax error is detected in a string literal
      within a JSON value failed to set the error cursor appropriately.
      This led at least to an unhelpful error message (pointing to the
      token before the string, rather than the actual trouble spot), and
      could even result in a crash in v14 and later.

      In v14 and later with non-default settings

      Fix <application>pg_dump</application> so that partitioned tables
      that are hash-partitioned on an enum-type column can be restored
      successfully (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the hash codes for enum values depend on the OIDs assigned to
      the enum, they are typically different after a dump and restore,
      meaning that rows often need to go into a different partition than
      they were in originally.  Users can work around that by specifying
      the <option>--load-via-partition-root</option> option; but since
      there is very little chance of success without that,
      teach <application>pg_dump</application> to apply it automatically
      to such tables.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, fix <application>pg_restore</application> to not try
      to <command>TRUNCATE</command> target tables before restoring into
      them when <option>--load-via-partition-root</option> mode is used.
      This avoids a hazard of deadlocks and lost data.

      In cases of corruption we might see a wrapped-around 32-bit xid that

      A regex such as <literal>$foo</literal> is legal but unsatisfiable;

      <application>libpq</application> can leak memory contents after
      GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion)
     </para>

     <para>
      A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can
      send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI
      (Kerberos) transport encryption.  <application>libpq</application>
      will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in
      application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report.
      Depending on what the calling application does with the error
      report, this could result in disclosure of application memory
      contents.  There is also a small probability of a crash due to
      reading beyond the end of memory.  Fix by properly zero-terminating
      the server message.

      Allow <literal>REPLICA IDENTITY</literal>

     <para>
      When <application>pg_dump</application> dumps a partitioned index
      that's marked <literal>REPLICA IDENTITY</literal>, it generates a
      command sequence that applies <literal>REPLICA IDENTITY</literal>
      before the partitioned index has been marked valid, causing restore
      to fail.  There seems no very good reason to prohibit doing it in
      that order, so allow it.  The marking will have no effect anyway
      until the index becomes valid.

      Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length

     <para>
      The server would process a cancel request even if its length word
      was too small.  This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated
      buffer.  In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite
      unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be
      very close to the end of memory.  The more likely outcome was a bogus
      log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code.  Complain about
      the wrong length, instead.

      Fix deadlock between <command>DROP DATABASE</command> and logical

     </para>

     <para>
      This was caused by an ill-advised choice to block interrupts while
      creating a logical replication slot in the worker.  In version 15
      that could lead to an undetected deadlock.  In version 14, no
      deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block
      interrupts while waiting for network I/O.

     <para>

      code paths that's pretty harmless because the calling process will
      give up and exit.  But in commands such as <command>CREATE

     <para>
      After a server restart, we'll re-stream the changes for transactions
      occurring shortly before the restart.  Some of these transactions
      probably never completed; when we realize that one didn't we throw
      away the relevant decoding state locally, but we neglected to tell
      the subscriber about it.  That led to the subscriber keeping useless
      streaming files until it's next restarted.

     <para>
      Fix failure to remove non-first segments of large tables
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> splits large tables into
      multiple files (normally with 1GB per file).  The logic for dropping
      a table was broken and would miss removing all but the first such
      file, in two cases: drops of temporary tables and WAL replay of
      drops of regular tables.  Applications that routinely create
      multi-gigabyte temporary tables could suffer significant disk space
      leakage.
     </para>

     <para>
      Orphaned temporary-table files are removed during postmaster start,
      so the mere act of updating to 15.1 is sufficient to clear any
      leaked temporary-table storage.  However, if you suffered any
      database crashes while using 15.0, and there might have been
      large tables dropped just before such crashes, it's advisable
      to check the database directories for files named according to the
      pattern
      <literal><replaceable>NNNN</replaceable>.<replaceable>NN</replaceable></literal>.
      If there is no matching file named
      just <literal><replaceable>NNNN</replaceable></literal> (without
      the <literal>.<replaceable>NN</replaceable></literal> suffix), these
      files should be removed manually.

      Prevent attempts to replicate into a foreign-table partition in
      replication workers (Shi Yu, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Although partitioned tables can have foreign tables as partitions,
      replicating into such a partition isn't currently supported.
      The logical replication worker process would crash if it was
      attempted.  Now, an error is thrown.

     </para>

     <para>
      Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby,
      more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970:
      Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei,
      Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam,
      Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo,
      Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen,
      Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti,
      Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis.
      (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of
      these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland,
      Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.)  America/Nipigon,
      America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and
      Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after
      discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those
      zones seem to have been errors.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias;
      but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.
     </para>

     <para>
      These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for
      the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications
      expecting consistency of <type>timestamptz</type> display.  As an
      example, the stored value <literal>1944-06-01 12:00 UTC</literal>
      would previously display as <literal>1944-06-01
      13:00:00+01</literal> if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but
      now it will read out as <literal>1944-06-01 14:00:00+02</literal>.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that
      will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot
      of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in
      more total changes from the previous release than accepting these
      upstream changes does.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
      chosen to ship the <productname>tzdb</productname> data
      as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating
      system distributions are doing likewise.  However, if these changes
      cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution
      is to install a local build of the time zone data files using
      <productname>tzdb</productname>'s backwards-compatibility options
      (see their <literal>PACKRATDATA</literal>
      and <literal>PACKRATLIST</literal> options).

       to depend on the composite type as a whole.  This meant that
       dropping the individual column would be allowed, causing problems
       in later use of the view or rule.  The column-level dependency is
       now also noted, so that dropping such a column will be rejected
       unless the view is changed or dropped.
