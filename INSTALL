  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

In general, a modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run
PostgreSQL. The platforms that had received explicit testing at the time of
release are listed in the section called Supported Platforms below. In the
doc subdirectory of the distribution there are several platform-specific FAQ
documents you might wish to consult if you are having trouble.

The following prerequisites exist for building PostgreSQL:

   * GNU make is required; other make programs will not work. GNU make is
     often installed under the name gmake; this document will always refer
     to it by that name. (On GNU/Linux systems GNU make is the default tool
     with the name make.) To test for GNU make enter

     gmake --version

     If at all possible you should use version 3.76.1 or later.

   * You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler. Recent versions of GCC are
     recommendable, but PostgreSQL is known to build with a wide variety of
     compilers from different vendors.

   * gzip

   * The GNU Readline library for comfortable line editing and command
     history retrieval will automatically be used if found. You might wish
     to install it before proceeding, but it is not required.

   * Flex and Bison are not required when building from a released source
     package because the output files are pre-generated. You will need these
     programs only when building from a CVS tree or when the actual scanner
     and parser definition files were changed. If you need them, be sure to
     get Flex 2.5.4 or later and Bison 1.28 or later. Other yacc programs
     can sometimes be used, but doing so requires extra efforts and is not
     recommended. Other lex programs will definitely not work.

   * To build on Windows NT or Windows 2000 you need the Cygwin and cygipc
     packages. See the file doc/FAQ_MSWIN for details.

If you need to get a GNU package, you can find it at your local GNU mirror
site (see http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html for a list) or at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/.

Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about 30 MB
for the source tree during compilation and about 5 MB for the installation
directory. An empty database takes about 1 MB, later it takes about five
times the amount of space that a flat text file with the same data would
take. If you are going to run the regression tests you will temporarily need
an extra 20 MB. Use the df command to check for disk space.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If You Are Upgrading

The internal data storage format changes with new releases of PostgreSQL.
Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing installation that does not have
a version number "7.1.x", you must back up and restore your data as shown
here. These instructions assume that your existing installation is under the
/usr/local/pgsql directory, and that the data area is in
/usr/local/pgsql/data. Substitute your paths appropriately.

  1. Make sure that your database is not updated during or after the backup.
     This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the changed data
     would of course not be included. If necessary, edit the permissions in
     the file /usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf (or equivalent) to disallow
     access from everyone except you.

  2. To dump your database installation, type:

     pg_dumpall > outputfile

     If you need to preserve the OIDs (such as when using them as foreign
     keys), then use the -o option when running pg_dumpall.

     Make sure that you use the pg_dumpall command from the version you are
     currently running. 7.1devel's pg_dumpall should not be used on older
     databases.

  3. If you are installing the new version at the same location as the old
     one then shut down the old server, at the latest before you install the
     new files:

     kill -INT `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`

     Versions prior to 7.0 do not have this postmaster.pid file. If you are
     using such a version you must find out the process id of the server
     yourself, for example by typing ps ax | grep postmaster, and supply it
     to the kill command.

     On systems which have PostgreSQL started at boot time, there is
     probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
     example, on a Red Hat Linux system one might find that

     /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop

     works.

  4. If you are installing in the same place as the old version then it is
     also a good idea to move the old installation out of the way, in case
     you still need it later on. Use a command like this:

     mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old

After you have installed PostgreSQL 7.1devel, create a new database
directory and start the new server. Remember that you must execute these
commands while logged in to the special database user account (which you
already have if you are upgrading).

/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

Finally, restore your data with

/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d template1 -f outputfile

using the new psql.

You can also install the new version in parallel with the old one to
decrease the downtime. These topics are discussed at length in the
Administrator's Guide, which you are encouraged to read in any case.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Procedure

  1. Configuration

     The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the source
     tree for your system and choose the options you would like. This is
     done by running the configure script. For a default installation simply
     enter

     ./configure

     This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
     system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your operating
     system, and finally creates several files in the build tree to record
     what it found.

     The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as well
     as all client applications and interfaces that only require a C
     compiler. All files will be installed under /usr/local/pgsql by
     default.

     You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
     or more of the following command line options to configure:

     --prefix=PREFIX

          Install all files under the directory PREFIX instead of
          /usr/local/pgsql. The actual files will be installed into various
          subdirectories; no files will ever be installed directly into the
          PREFIX directory.

          If you have special needs, you can also customize the individual
          subdirectories with the following options.

     --exec-prefix=EXEC-PREFIX

          You can install architecture-dependent files under a different
          prefix, EXEC-PREFIX, than what PREFIX was set to. This can be
          useful to share architecture-independent files between hosts. If
          you omit this, then EXEC-PREFIX is set equal to PREFIX and both
          architecture dependent and independent files will be installed
          under the same tree, which is probably what you want.

     --bindir=DIRECTORY

          Specifies the directory for executable programs. The default is
          EXEC-PREFIX/bin, which normally means /usr/local/pgsql/bin.

     --datadir=DIRECTORY

          Sets the directory for read-only data files used by the installed
          programs. The default is PREFIX/share. Note that this has nothing
          to do with where your database files will be placed.

     --sysconfdir=DIRECTORY

          The directory for various configuration files, PREFIX/etc by
          default.

     --libdir=DIRECTORY

          The location to install libraries and dynamically loadable
          modules. The default is EXEC-PREFIX/lib.

     --includedir=DIRECTORY

          The directory for installing C and C++ header files. The default
          is PREFIX/include.

     --docdir=DIRECTORY

          Documentation files, except "man" pages, will be installed into
          this directory. The default is PREFIX/doc.

     --mandir=DIRECTORY

          The man pages that come with PostgreSQL will be installed under
          this directory, in their respective manx subdirectories. The
          default is PREFIX/man.

          Note: To reduce the pollution of shared installation
          locations (such as /usr/local/include), the string
          "/postgresql" is automatically appended to datadir,
          sysconfdir, includedir, and docdir, unless the fully expanded
          directory name already contains the string "postgres" or
          "pgsql". For example, if you choose /usr/local as prefix, the
          C header files will be installed in
          /usr/local/include/postgresql, but if the prefix is
          /opt/postgres, then they will be in /opt/postgres/include.

     --with-includes=DIRECTORIES

          DIRECTORIES is a colon-separated list of directories that will be
          added to the list the compiler searches for header files. If you
          have optional packages (such as GNU Readline) installed in a
          non-standard location you have to use this option and probably the
          corresponding --with-libraries option.

          Example: --with-includes=/opt/gnu/include:/usr/sup/include.

     --with-libraries=DIRECTORIES

          DIRECTORIES is a colon-separated list of directories to search for
          libraries. You will probably have to use this option (and the
          corresponding --with-includes option) if you have packages
          installed in non-standard locations.

          Example: --with-libraries=/opt/gnu/lib:/usr/sup/lib.

     --enable-locale

          Enables locale support. There is a performance penalty associated
          with locale support, but if you are not in an English-speaking
          environment you will most likely need this.

     --enable-recode

          Enables single-byte character set recode support. See the
          Administrator's Guide about this feature.

     --enable-multibyte

          Allows the use of multibyte character encodings. This is primarily
          for languages like Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. Read the
          Administrator's Guide for details.

     --with-pgport=NUMBER

          Set NUMBER as the default port number for server and clients. The
          default is 5432. The port can always be changed later on, but if
          you specify it here then both server and clients will have the
          same default compiled in, which can be very convenient.

     --with-CXX

          Build the C++ interface library.

     --with-perl

          Build the Perl interface module. The Perl interface will be
          installed at the usual place for Perl modules (typically under
          /usr/lib/perl), so you must have root access to perform the
          installation step (see step 4). You need to have Perl 5 installed
          to use this option.

     --with-python

          Build the Python interface module. You need to have root access to
          be able to install the Python module at its default place
          (/usr/lib/pythonx.y). To be able to use this option, you must have
          Python installed and your system needs to support shared
          libraries. If you instead want to build a new complete interpreter
          binary, you will have to do it manually.

     --with-tcl

          Builds components that require Tcl/Tk, which are libpgtcl,
          pgtclsh, pgtksh, pgaccess, and PL/Tcl. But see below about
          --without-tk.

     --without-tk

          If you specify --with-tcl and this option, then programs that
          require Tk (i.e., pgtksh and pgaccess) will be excluded.

     --with-tclconfig=DIRECTORY, --with-tkconfig=DIRECTORY

          Tcl/Tk installs the files tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh which
          contain certain configuration information that is needed to build
          modules interfacing to Tcl or Tk. These files are normally found
          automatically at their well-known location, but if you want to use
          a different version of Tcl or Tk you can specify the directory
          where to find them.

     --enable-odbc

          Build the ODBC driver package.

     --with-odbcinst=DIRECTORY

          Specifies the directory where the ODBC driver will expect its
          odbcinst.ini configuration file. The default is
          /usr/local/pgsql/etc or whatever you specified as --sysconfdir. A
          default file will be installed there. If you intend to share the
          odbcinst.ini file between several ODBC drivers then you may want
          to use this option.

     --with-krb4=DIRECTORY, --with-krb5=DIRECTORY

          Build with support for Kerberos authentication. You can use either
          Kerberos version 4 or 5, but not both. The DIRECTORY argument
          specifies the root directory of the Kerberos installation;
          /usr/athena is assumed as default. If the relevant headers files
          and libraries are not under a common parent directory, then you
          must use the --with-includes and --with-libraries options in
          addition to this option. If, on the other hand, the required files
          are in a location that is searched by default (e.g., /usr/lib),
          then you can leave off the argument.

          configure will check for the required header files and libraries
          to make sure that your Kerberos installation is sufficient before
          proceeding.

     --with-krb-srvnam=NAME

          The name of the Kerberos service principal. "postgres" is the
          default. There's probably no reason to change this.

     --with-openssl=DIRECTORY

          Build with support for SSL (encrypted) connections. This requires
          the OpenSSL package to be installed. The DIRECTORY argument
          specifies the root directory of the OpenSSL installation; the
          default is /usr/local/ssl.

          configure will check for the required header files and libraries
          to make sure that your OpenSSL installation is sufficient before
          proceeding.

     --enable-syslog

          Enables the PostgreSQL server to use the syslog logging facility.
          (Using this option does not mean that you must log with syslog or
          even that it will be done by default, it simply makes it possible
          to turn this option on at run time.)

     --enable-debug

          Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging symbols. This
          means that you can run the programs through a debugger to analyze
          problems. This option is not recommended for production use.

     If you prefer a C or C++ compiler different from the one configure
     picks then you can set the environment variables CC and CXX,
     respectively, to the program of your choice. Similarly, you can
     override the default compiler flags with the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
     variables. For example:

     env CC=/opt/bin/gcc CFLAGS='-02 -pipe' ./configure

  2. Build

     To start the build, type

     gmake

     (Remember to use GNU make.) The build can take anywhere from 5 minutes
     to half an hour. The last line displayed should be

     All of PostgreSQL is successfully made. Ready to install.

  3. Regression Tests

     If you want to test the newly built server before you install it, you
     can run the regression tests at this point. The regression tests are a
     test suite to verify that PostgreSQL runs on your machine in the way
     the developers expected it to. Type

     gmake check

     It is possible that some tests fail, due to differences in error
     message wording or floating point results. The file
     src/test/regress/README and the Administrator's Guide contain detailed
     information about interpreting the test results. You can repeat this
     test at any later time by issuing the same command.

  4. Installing The Files

          Note: If you are upgrading an existing system and are going
          to install the new files over the old ones then you should
          have backed up your data and shut down the old server by now,
          as explained in the section called If You Are Upgrading
          above.

     To install PostgreSQL enter

     gmake install

     This will install files into the directories that were specified in
     step 1. Make sure that you have appropriate permissions to write into
     that area. Normally you need to do this step as root. Alternatively,
     you could create the target directories in advance and arrange for
     appropriate permissions to be granted.

     If you built the Perl or Python interfaces and you were not the root
     user when you executed the above command then that part of the
     installation probably failed. In that case you should become the root
     user and then do

     gmake -C src/interfaces/perl5 install
     gmake -C src/interfaces/python install

     Due to a quirk in the Perl build environment the first command will
     actually rebuild the complete interface and then install it. This is
     not harmful, just unusual. If you do not have superuser access you are
     on your own: you can still take the required files and place them in
     other directories where Perl or Python can find them, but how to do
     that is left as an exercise.

     Client-only installation. If you want to install only the client
     applications and interfaces, then you can use these commands:

     gmake -C src/bin install
     gmake -C src/interfaces install
     gmake -C doc install

     To undo the installation use the command gmake uninstall. However, this
     will not remove the Perl and Python interfaces and it will not remove
     any directories.

After the installation you can make room by removing the built files from
the source tree with the gmake clean command. This will preserve the choices
made by the configure program, so that you can rebuild everything with gmake
later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was distributed,
use gmake distclean. If you are going to build for several platforms from
the same source tree you must do this and re-configure for each build.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Installation Setup

Shared Libraries

On some systems that have shared libraries (which most systems do) you need
to tell your system how to find the newly installed shared libraries. The
systems on which this is not necessary include FreeBSD, HP/UX, Irix, Linux,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, OSF/1 (Digital Unix, Tru64 UNIX), and Solaris.

The method to set the shared library search path varies between platforms,
but the most widely usable method is to set the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH like so: In Bourne shells (sh, ksh, bash, zsh)

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

or in csh or tcsh

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib

Replace /usr/local/pgsql/lib with whatever you set --libdir to in step 1.
You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such as
/etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile. Some good information about the caveats
associated with the method can be found at
http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html.

On some systems it might be preferable to set the environment variable
LD_RUN_PATH before building.

If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps ld.so or
rld). If you later on get a message like

psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

then this step was necessary. Simply take care of it then.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment Variables

If you installed into /usr/local/pgsql or some other location that is not
searched for programs by default, you need to add /usr/local/pgsql/bin (or
what you set --bindir to in step 1) into your PATH. To do this, add the
following to your shell start-up file, such as ~/.bash_profile (or
/etc/profile, if you want it to affect every user):

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin

If you are using csh or tcsh, then use this command:

set path = ( /usr/local/pgsql/bin path )

To enable your system to find the man documentation, you need to add a line
like the following to a shell start-up file:

MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/pgsql/man

The environment variables PGHOST and PGPORT specify to client applications
the host and port of the database server, overriding the compiled-in
defaults. If you are going to run client applications remotely then it is
convenient if every user that plans to use the database sets PGHOST, but it
is not required and the settings can be communicated via command line
options to most client programs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started

The following is a quick summary of how to get PostgreSQL up and running
once installed. The Administrator's Guide contains more information.

  1. Create a user account for the PostgreSQL server. This is the user the
     server will run as. For production use you should create a separate,
     unprivileged account ("postgres" is commonly used). If you do not have
     root access or just want to play around, your own user account is
     enough, but running the server as root is a security risk and will not
     work.

     adduser postgres

  2. Create a database installation with the initdb command. To run initdb
     you must be logged in to your PostgreSQL server account. It will not
     work as root.

     root# mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
     root# chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
     root# su - postgres
     postgres$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

     The -D option specifies the location where the data will be stored. You
     can use any path you want, it does not have to be under the
     installation directory. Just make sure that the server account can
     write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already exist)
     before starting initdb, as illustrated here.

  3. The previous step should have told you how to start up the database
     server. Do so now. The command should look something like

     /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

     This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server in the
     background use something like

     nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
         </dev/null >>server.log 2>&1 </dev/null &

     To stop a server running in the background you can type

     kill `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`

     In order to allow TCP/IP connections (rather than only Unix domain
     socket ones) you need to pass the -i option to postmaster.

  4. Create a database:

     createdb testdb

     Then enter

     psql testdb

     to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL commands
     and start experimenting.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Now?

   * The Tutorial should be your first reading if you are completely new to
     SQL databases. It should have been installed at
     /usr/local/pgsql/doc/html/tutorial.htm unless you changed the
     installation directories.

   * If you are familiar with database concepts then you want to proceed
     with the Administrator's Guide, which contains information about how to
     set up the database server, database users, and authentication. It can
     be found at /usr/local/pgsql/doc/html/admin.htm.

   * Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will
     automatically start the database server whenever it boots. Some
     suggestions for this are in the Administrator's Guide.

   * Run the regression tests against the installed server (using the
     sequential test method). If you didn't run the tests before
     installation, you should definitely do it now. This is also explained
     in the Administrator's Guide.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported Platforms

PostgreSQL has been verified by the developer community to work on the
platforms listed below. A supported platform generally means that PostgreSQL
builds and installs according to these instructions and that the regression
tests pass.

     Note: If you are having problems with the installation on a
     supported platform, please write to <pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org> or
     <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org>, not to the people listed here.
