  </indexterm>

  <para>
   As with any server daemon that is accessible to the outside world,
   it is advisable to run <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> under a
   separate user account. This user account should only own the data
   that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other
   daemons. (For example, using the user <literal>nobody</literal> is a bad
   idea.) It is not advisable to install executables owned by this
   user because compromised systems could then modify their own
   binaries.
  </para>

  <para>
   To add a Unix user account to your system, look for a command
   <command>useradd</command> or <command>adduser</command>. The user
   name <systemitem>postgres</systemitem> is often used, and is assumed
   throughout this book, but you can use another name if you like.

  <title>Creating a Database Cluster</title>

   <primary>data area</primary>
   <see>database cluster</see>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage
   area on disk. We call this a <firstterm>database cluster</firstterm>.
   (The <acronym>SQL</acronym> standard uses the term catalog cluster.) A
   database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a
   single instance of a running database server. After initialization, a
   database cluster will contain a database named <literal>postgres</literal>,
   which is meant as a default database for use by utilities, users and third
   party applications.  The database server itself does not require the
   <literal>postgres</literal> database to exist, but many external utility
   programs assume it exists.  Another database created within each cluster
   during initialization is called
   <literal>template1</literal>.  As the name suggests, this will be used
   as a template for subsequently created databases; it should not be
   used for actual work.  (See <xref linkend="managing-databases"> for
   information about creating new databases within a cluster.)
  </para>

  <para>
   In file system terms, a database cluster is a single directory
   under which all data will be stored. We call this the <firstterm>data
   directory</firstterm> or <firstterm>data area</firstterm>. It is
   completely up to you where you choose to store your data.  There is no
   default, although locations such as
   <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</filename> or
   <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename> are popular. To initialize a
   database cluster, use the command <xref
   linkend="app-initdb">,<indexterm><primary>initdb</></> which is
   installed with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. The desired
   file system location of your database cluster is indicated by the
   <option>-D</option> option, for example:
<screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   Note that you must execute this command while logged into the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account, which is
   described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    As an alternative to the <option>-D</option> option, you can set
    the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
    <indexterm><primary><envar>PGDATA</envar></primary></indexterm>
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   Alternatively, you can run <command>initdb</command> via
   the <xref linkend="app-pg-ctl">
   program<indexterm><primary>pg_ctl</></> like so:
<screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data initdb</userinput>
</screen>
   This may be more intuitive if you are
   using <command>pg_ctl</command> for starting and stopping the
   server (see <xref linkend="server-start">), so
   that <command>pg_ctl</command> would be the sole command you use
   for managing the database server instance.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will attempt to create the directory you
   specify if it does not already exist.  Of course, this will fail if
   <command>initdb</command> does not have permissions to write in the
   parent directory.  It's generally recommendable that the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user own not just the data
   directory but its parent directory as well, so that this should not
   be a problem.  If the desired parent directory doesn't exist either,
   you will need to create it first, using root privileges if the
   grandparent directory isn't writable.  So the process might look
   like this:
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql</userinput>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql</userinput>
root# <userinput>su postgres</userinput>
postgres$ <userinput>initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> will refuse to run if the data directory
   exists and already contains files; this is to prevent accidentally
   overwriting an existing installation.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because the data directory contains all the data stored in the
   database, it is essential that it be secured from unauthorized
   access. <command>initdb</command> therefore revokes access
   permissions from everyone but the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user.
  </para>

  <para>
   However, while the directory contents are secure, the default
   client authentication setup allows any local user to connect to the
   database and even become the database superuser. If you do not
   trust other local users, we recommend you use one of
   <command>initdb</command>'s <option>-W</option>, <option>--pwprompt</option>
   or <option>--pwfile</option> options to assign a password to the
   database superuser.<indexterm>
     <primary>password</>
     <secondary>of the superuser</>
   </indexterm>
   Also, specify <option>-A md5</> or
   <option>-A password</> so that the default <literal>trust</> authentication
   mode is not used; or modify the generated <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
   file after running <command>initdb</command>, but
   <emphasis>before</> you start the server for the first time. (Other
   reasonable approaches include using <literal>peer</literal> authentication
   or file system permissions to restrict connections. See <xref
   linkend="client-authentication"> for more information.)
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> also initializes the default
   locale<indexterm><primary>locale</></> for the database cluster.
   Normally, it will just take the locale settings in the environment
   and apply them to the initialized database.  It is possible to
   specify a different locale for the database; more information about
   that can be found in <xref linkend="locale">.  The default sort order used
   within the particular database cluster is set by
   <command>initdb</command>, and while you can create new databases using
   different sort order, the order used in the template databases that initdb
   creates cannot be changed without dropping and recreating them.
   There is also a performance impact for using locales
   other than <literal>C</> or <literal>POSIX</>. Therefore, it is
   important to make this choice correctly the first time.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>initdb</command> also sets the default character set encoding
   for the database cluster.  Normally this should be chosen to match the
   locale setting.  For details see <xref linkend="multibyte">.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="creating-cluster-mount-points">
   <title>Use of Secondary File Systems</title>

   <indexterm zone="creating-cluster-mount-points">
    <primary>file system mount points</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    Many installations create their database clusters on file systems
    (volumes) other than the machine's <quote>root</> volume.  If you
    choose to do this, it is not advisable to try to use the secondary
    volume's topmost directory (mount point) as the data directory.
    Best practice is to create a directory within the mount-point
    directory that is owned by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    user, and then create the data directory within that.  This avoids
    permissions problems, particularly for operations such
    as <application>pg_upgrade</>, and it also ensures clean failures if
    the secondary volume is taken offline.

   <indexterm><primary><acronym>NFS</></><see>Network File Systems</></>
   <indexterm><primary>Network Attached Storage (<acronym>NAS</>)</><see>Network File Systems</></>

   <para>
    Many installations create their database clusters on network file
    systems.  Sometimes this is done via <acronym>NFS</>, or by using a
    Network Attached Storage (<acronym>NAS</>) device that uses
    <acronym>NFS</> internally.  <productname>PostgreSQL</> does nothing
    special for <acronym>NFS</> file systems, meaning it assumes
    <acronym>NFS</> behaves exactly like locally-connected drives.
    If the client or server <acronym>NFS</> implementation does not
    provide standard file system semantics, this can
    cause reliability problems (see <ulink
    url="http://www.time-travellers.org/shane/papers/NFS_considered_harmful.html"></ulink>).
    Specifically, delayed (asynchronous) writes to the <acronym>NFS</>
    server can cause data corruption problems.  If possible, mount the
    <acronym>NFS</> file system synchronously (without caching) to avoid
    this hazard.  Also, soft-mounting the <acronym>NFS</> file system is
    not recommended.
   </para>

   <para>
    Storage Area Networks (<acronym>SAN</>) typically use communication
    protocols other than <acronym>NFS</>, and may or may not be subject
    to hazards of this sort.  It's advisable to consult the vendor's
    documentation concerning data consistency guarantees.
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> cannot be more reliable than
    the file system it's using.
   </para>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="server-start">
  <title>Starting the Database Server</title>

  <para>
   Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database
   server. The database server program is called
   <command>postgres</command>.<indexterm><primary>postgres</></>
   The <command>postgres</command> program must know where to
   find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the
   <option>-D</option> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the
   server is:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</userinput>
</screen>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be
   done while logged into the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user
   account. Without <option>-D</option>, the server will try to use
   the data directory named by the environment variable <envar>PGDATA</envar>.
   If that variable is not provided either, it will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally it is better to start <command>postgres</command> in the
   background.  For this, use the usual Unix shell syntax:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</userinput>
</screen>
   It is important to store the server's <systemitem>stdout</> and
   <systemitem>stderr</> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help
   for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <xref
   linkend="logfile-maintenance"> for a more thorough discussion of log
   file handling.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The <command>postgres</command> program also takes a number of other
   command-line options. For more information, see the
   <xref linkend="app-postgres"> reference page
   and <xref linkend="runtime-config"> below.
  </para>

  <para>
   This shell syntax can get tedious quickly.  Therefore the wrapper
   program
   <xref linkend="app-pg-ctl"><indexterm><primary>pg_ctl</primary></indexterm>
   is provided to simplify some tasks.  For example:
<programlisting>
pg_ctl start -l logfile
</programlisting>
   will start the server in the background and put the output into the
   named log file. The <option>-D</option> option has the same meaning
   here as for <command>postgres</command>. <command>pg_ctl</command>
   is also capable of stopping the server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots.<indexterm>
     <primary>booting</>
     <secondary>starting the server during</>
   </indexterm>
   Autostart scripts are operating-system-specific.
   There are a few distributed with
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> in the
   <filename>contrib/start-scripts</> directory. Installing one will require
   root privileges.
  </para>

  <para>
   Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons
   at boot time. Many systems have a file
   <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>. Others use <filename>init.d</filename> or
   <filename>rc.d</> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be
   run by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> user account
   <emphasis>and not by root</emphasis> or any other user. Therefore you
   probably should form your commands using
   <literal>su postgres -c '...'</literal>.  For example:
<programlisting>
su postgres -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog'
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Here are a few more operating-system-specific suggestions. (In each
   case be sure to use the proper installation directory and user
   name where we show generic values.)

     <para>
      Consider carefully the timeout

      readiness within that time.  But a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      server that might have to perform crash recovery at startup could take
      much longer to become ready.  The suggested value of 0 disables the

    While the server is running, its
    <acronym>PID</acronym> is stored in the file
    <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. This is
    used to prevent multiple server instances from
    running in the same data directory and can also be used for
    shutting down the server.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="server-start-failures">
    <title>Server Start-up Failures</title>

    <para>
     There are several common reasons the server might fail to
     start. Check the server's log file, or start it by hand (without
     redirecting standard output or standard error) and see what error
     messages appear. Below we explain some of the most common error
     messages in more detail.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
     This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start
     another server on the same port where one is already running.
     However, if the kernel error message is not <computeroutput>Address
     already in use</computeroutput> or some variant of that, there might
     be a different problem. For example, trying to start a server
     on a reserved port number might draw something like:
<screen>
$ <userinput>postgres -p 666</userinput>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Permission denied
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 666? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     A message like:
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument
DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5440001, size=4011376640, 03600).
</screen>
     probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is
     smaller than the work area <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
     is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you
     can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number of
     buffers (<xref linkend="guc-shared-buffers">). You will eventually want
     to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory
     size. You might also see this message when trying to start multiple
     servers on the same machine, if their total space requested
     exceeds the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     An error like:
<screen>
FATAL:  could not create semaphores: No space left on device
DETAIL:  Failed system call was semget(5440126, 17, 03600).
</screen>
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean you've run out of disk
     space. It means your kernel's limit on the number of <systemitem
     class="osname">System V</> semaphores is smaller than the number
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> wants to create. As above,
     you might be able to work around the problem by starting the
     server with a reduced number of allowed connections
     (<xref linkend="guc-max-connections">), but you'll eventually want to
     increase the kernel limit.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you get an <quote>illegal system call</> error, it is likely that
     shared memory or semaphores are not supported in your kernel at
     all. In that case your only option is to reconfigure the kernel to
     enable these features.
    </para>

    <para>
     Details about configuring <systemitem class="osname">System V</>
     <acronym>IPC</> facilities are given in <xref linkend="sysvipc">.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="client-connection-problems">
    <title>Client Connection Problems</title>

    <para>
     Although the error conditions possible on the client side are quite
     varied and application-dependent, a few of them might be directly
     related to how the server was started. Conditions other than
     those shown below should be documented with the respective client
     application.
    </para>

    <para>
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "server.joe.com" and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
</screen>
     This is the generic <quote>I couldn't find a server to talk
     to</quote> failure. It looks like the above when TCP/IP
     communication is attempted. A common mistake is to forget to
     configure the server to allow TCP/IP connections.
    </para>

    <para>
     Alternatively, you'll get this when attempting Unix-domain socket
     communication to a local server:
<screen>
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to
     connect to the right place. If there is in fact no server
     running there, the kernel error message will typically be either
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> or
     <computeroutput>No such file or directory</computeroutput>, as
     illustrated. (It is important to realize that
     <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput> in this context
     does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that the server got your
     connection request and rejected it. That case will produce a
     different message, as shown in <xref
     linkend="client-authentication-problems">.) Other error messages
     such as <computeroutput>Connection timed out</computeroutput> might
     indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network
     connectivity.

 <sect1 id="kernel-resources">
  <title>Managing Kernel Resources</title>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> can sometimes exhaust various operating system
   resource limits, especially when multiple copies of the server are running

   <para>
    Shared memory and semaphores are collectively referred to as

    provides its own replacement implementation of these facilities, these
    facilities are required in order to run
    <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The complete lack of these facilities is usually manifested by an
    <errorname>Illegal system call</> error upon server start. In
    that case there is no alternative but to reconfigure your
    kernel.  <productname>PostgreSQL</> won't work without them.
    This situation is rare, however, among modern operating systems.

   <para>
    When <productname>PostgreSQL</> exceeds one of the various hard

    should leave an instructive error message describing the problem
    and what to do about it. (See also <xref

    parameters are named consistently across different systems; <xref

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> requires a few bytes of System V shared memory
    (typically 48 bytes, on 64-bit platforms) for each copy of the server.
    On most modern operating systems, this amount can easily be allocated.
    However, if you are running many copies of the server, or if other
    applications are also using System V shared memory, it may be necessary
    to increase <varname>SHMMAX</>, the maximum size in bytes of a shared
    memory segment, or <varname>SHMALL</>, the total amount of System V shared
    memory system-wide.  Note that <varname>SHMALL</> is measured in pages
    rather than bytes on many systems.
   </para>

   <para>
    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<varname>SHMMIN</>), which should be at most
    approximately 32 bytes for <productname>PostgreSQL</> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<varname>SHMMNI</>) or per-process (<varname>SHMSEG</>) are unlikely
    to cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<xref linkend="guc-max-connections">), allowed autovacuum worker process
    (<xref linkend="guc-autovacuum-max-workers">) and allowed background
    process (<xref linkend="guc-max-worker-processes">), in sets of 16.
    Each such set will
    also contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <quote>magic
    number</quote>, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <varname>SEMMNS</>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <varname>max_connections</> plus
    <varname>autovacuum_max_workers</> plus <varname>max_worker_processes</>,
    plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections plus workers (see the formula in <xref
    linkend="sysvipc-parameters">).  The parameter <varname>SEMMNI</>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <literal>ceil((max_connections + autovacuum_max_workers + max_worker_processes + 5) / 16)</>.
    Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <quote>No space
    left on device</>, from the function <function>semget</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    In some cases it might also be necessary to increase
    <varname>SEMMAP</> to be at least on the order of
    <varname>SEMMNS</>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <varname>SEMMSL</> parameter, which determines how many
    semaphores can be in a set, must be at least 17 for
    <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   </para>

       <para>
        The file <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</> is only honored in OS X

        In Solaris 10 and later, and OpenSolaris, the default shared memory and
        semaphore settings are good enough for most
        <productname>PostgreSQL</> applications.  Solaris now defaults
        to a <varname>SHMMAX</> of one-quarter of system <acronym>RAM</>.
        To further adjust this setting, use a project setting associated
        with the <literal>postgres</> user.  For example, run the
        following as <literal>root</>:
<programlisting>
projadd -c "PostgreSQL DB User" -K "project.max-shm-memory=(privileged,8GB,deny)" -U postgres -G postgres user.postgres

        user to 8GB, and takes effect the next time that user logs
        in, or when you restart <productname>PostgreSQL</> (not reload).
        The above assumes that <productname>PostgreSQL</> is run by

   <title>Resource Limits</title>

   <para>
    Unix-like operating systems enforce various kinds of resource limits
    that might interfere with the operation of your
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server. Of particular
    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a <quote>hard</quote> and a
    <quote>soft</quote> limit. The soft limit is what actually counts
    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <function>setrlimit</function> is responsible for setting these
    parameters. The shell's built-in command <command>ulimit</command>
    (Bourne shells) or <command>limit</command> (<application>csh</>) is
    used to control the resource limits from the command line. On
    BSD-derived systems the file <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>
    controls the various resource limits set during login. See the
    operating system documentation for details. The relevant
    parameters are <varname>maxproc</varname>,
    <varname>openfiles</varname>, and <varname>datasize</varname>. For
    example:
<programlisting>
default:\
...
        :datasize-cur=256M:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :openfiles-cur=256:\
...
</programlisting>
    (<literal>-cur</literal> is the soft limit.  Append
    <literal>-max</literal> to set the hard limit.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Kernels can also have system-wide limits on some resources.
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      On <productname>Linux</productname>
      <filename>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</filename> determines the
      maximum number of open files that the kernel will support.  It can
      be changed by writing a different number into the file or by
      adding an assignment in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.
      The maximum limit of files per process is fixed at the time the
      kernel is compiled; see
      <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt</filename> for
      more information.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server uses one process
    per connection so you should provide for at least as many processes
    as allowed connections, in addition to what you need for the rest
    of your system.  This is usually not a problem but if you run
    several servers on one machine things might get tight.
   </para>

   <para>
    The factory default limit on open files is often set to
    <quote>socially friendly</quote> values that allow many users to
    coexist on a machine without using an inappropriate fraction of
    the system resources.  If you run many servers on a machine this
    is perhaps what you want, but on dedicated servers you might want to
    raise this limit.
   </para>

   <para>
    On the other side of the coin, some systems allow individual
    processes to open large numbers of files; if more than a few
    processes do so then the system-wide limit can easily be exceeded.
    If you find this happening, and you do not want to alter the
    system-wide limit, you can set <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s <xref
    linkend="guc-max-files-per-process"> configuration parameter to
    limit the consumption of open files.

   <para>
    In Linux 2.4 and later, the default virtual memory behavior is not
    optimal for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. Because of the
    way that the kernel implements memory overcommit, the kernel might
    terminate the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> postmaster (the
    master server process) if the memory demands of either
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> or another process cause the
    system to run out of virtual memory.
   </para>

   <para>
    If this happens, you will see a kernel message that looks like
    this (consult your system documentation and configuration on where
    to look for such a message):
<programlisting>
Out of Memory: Killed process 12345 (postgres).
</programlisting>
    This indicates that the <filename>postgres</filename> process
    has been terminated due to memory pressure.
    Although existing database connections will continue to function
    normally, no new connections will be accepted.  To recover,
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will need to be restarted.
   </para>

   <para>
    One way to avoid this problem is to run
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> on a machine where you can
    be sure that other processes will not run the machine out of
    memory.  If memory is tight, increasing the swap space of the
    operating system can help avoid the problem, because the
    out-of-memory (OOM) killer is invoked only when physical memory and
    swap space are exhausted.
   </para>

   <para>
    If <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> itself is the cause of the
    system running out of memory, you can avoid the problem by changing
    your configuration.  In some cases, it may help to lower memory-related
    configuration parameters, particularly
    <link linkend="guc-shared-buffers"><varname>shared_buffers</></link>
    and <link linkend="guc-work-mem"><varname>work_mem</></link>.  In
    other cases, the problem may be caused by allowing too many connections
    to the database server itself.  In many cases, it may be better to reduce
    <link linkend="guc-max-connections"><varname>max_connections</></link>
    and instead make use of external connection-pooling software.
   </para>

   <para>
    On Linux 2.6 and later, it is possible to modify the
    kernel's behavior so that it will not <quote>overcommit</> memory.
    Although this setting will not prevent the <ulink
    url="http://lwn.net/Articles/104179/">OOM killer</> from being invoked
    altogether, it will lower the chances significantly and will therefore
    lead to more robust system behavior.  This is done by selecting strict
    overcommit mode via <command>sysctl</command>:
<programlisting>
sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2
</programlisting>
    or placing an equivalent entry in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</>.
    You might also wish to modify the related setting
    <varname>vm.overcommit_ratio</>.  For details see the kernel documentation
    file <ulink url="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting"></ulink>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Another approach, which can be used with or without altering
    <varname>vm.overcommit_memory</>, is to set the process-specific
    <firstterm>OOM score adjustment</> value for the postmaster process to
    <literal>-1000</>, thereby guaranteeing it will not be targeted by the OOM
    killer.  The simplest way to do this is to execute
<programlisting>
echo -1000 > /proc/self/oom_score_adj
</programlisting>
    in the postmaster's startup script just before invoking the postmaster.
    Note that this action must be done as root, or it will have no effect;
    so a root-owned startup script is the easiest place to do it.  If you
    do this, you should also set these environment variables in the startup
    script before invoking the postmaster:
<programlisting>
export PG_OOM_ADJUST_FILE=/proc/self/oom_score_adj
export PG_OOM_ADJUST_VALUE=0
</programlisting>
    These settings will cause postmaster child processes to run with the
    normal OOM score adjustment of zero, so that the OOM killer can still
    target them at need.  You could use some other value for
    <envar>PG_OOM_ADJUST_VALUE</> if you want the child processes to run
    with some other OOM score adjustment.  (<envar>PG_OOM_ADJUST_VALUE</>
    can also be omitted, in which case it defaults to zero.)  If you do not
    set <envar>PG_OOM_ADJUST_FILE</>, the child processes will run with the
    same OOM score adjustment as the postmaster, which is unwise since the
    whole point is to ensure that the postmaster has a preferential setting.
   </para>

   <para>
    Older Linux kernels do not offer <filename>/proc/self/oom_score_adj</>,
    but may have a previous version of the same functionality called
    <filename>/proc/self/oom_adj</>.  This works the same except the disable
    value is <literal>-17</> not <literal>-1000</>.
   </para>

   <note>
   <para>
    Some vendors' Linux 2.4 kernels are reported to have early versions
    of the 2.6 overcommit <command>sysctl</command> parameter.  However, setting
    <literal>vm.overcommit_memory</> to 2
    on a 2.4 kernel that does not have the relevant code will make
    things worse, not better.  It is recommended that you inspect
    the actual kernel source code (see the function
    <function>vm_enough_memory</> in the file <filename>mm/mmap.c</>)
    to verify what is supported in your kernel before you try this in a 2.4
    installation.  The presence of the <filename>overcommit-accounting</>
    documentation file should <emphasis>not</> be taken as evidence that the
    feature is there.  If in any doubt, consult a kernel expert or your
    kernel vendor.

  <sect2 id="linux-huge-pages">
   <title>Linux huge pages</title>

   <para>
    Using huge pages reduces overhead when using large contiguous chunks of
    memory, like <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> does. To enable this
    feature in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> you need a kernel
    with <varname>CONFIG_HUGETLBFS=y</varname> and
    <varname>CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=y</varname>. You also have to tune the system
    setting <varname>vm.nr_hugepages</varname>. To estimate the number of
    necessary huge pages start <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> without
    huge pages enabled and check the <varname>VmPeak</varname> value from the
    proc file system:
<programlisting>
$ <userinput>head -1 /path/to/data/directory/postmaster.pid</userinput>
4170
$ <userinput>grep ^VmPeak /proc/4170/status</userinput>
VmPeak:  6490428 kB
</programlisting>
     <literal>6490428</literal> / <literal>2048</literal>
     (<varname>PAGE_SIZE</varname> is <literal>2MB</literal> in this case) are
     roughly <literal>3169.154</literal> huge pages, so you will need at
     least <literal>3170</literal> huge pages:
<programlisting>
$ <userinput>sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=3170</userinput>
</programlisting>
    Sometimes the kernel is not able to allocate the desired number of huge
    pages, so it might be necessary to repeat that command or to reboot. Don't
    forget to add an entry to <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> to persist
    this setting through reboots.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is also necessary to give the database server operating system
    user permission to use huge pages by setting
    <varname>vm.hugetlb_shm_group</> via <application>sysctl</>, and
    permission to lock memory with <command>ulimit -l</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The default behavior for huge pages in
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is to use them when possible and
    to fallback to normal pages when failing. To enforce the use of huge
    pages, you can set
    <link linkend="guc-huge-pages"><varname>huge_pages</varname></link>
    to <literal>on</literal>. Note that in this case
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will fail to start if not enough huge

       The server disallows new connections and sends all existing

      within 5 seconds, they will be sent <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem>.
      The master server process exits as soon as all child processes have
      exited, without doing normal database shutdown processing.

  <para>
   The <xref linkend="app-pg-ctl"> program provides a convenient
   interface for sending these signals to shut down the server.
   Alternatively, you can send the signal directly using <command>kill</>
   on non-Windows systems.
   The <acronym>PID</> of the <command>postgres</command> process can be
   found using the <command>ps</command> program, or from the file
   <filename>postmaster.pid</filename> in the data directory. For
   example, to do a fast shutdown:
<screen>
$ <userinput>kill -INT `head -1 /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`</userinput>
</screen>
  </para>

  <important>
   <para>
    It is best not to use <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> to shut down
    the server.  Doing so will prevent the server from releasing
    shared memory and semaphores, which might then have to be done
    manually before a new server can be started.  Furthermore,
    <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> kills the <command>postgres</command>
    process without letting it relay the signal to its subprocesses,
    so it will be necessary to kill the individual subprocesses by hand as
    well.

   To terminate an individual session while allowing other sessions to

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> major versions are represented by the
   first two digit groups of the version number, e.g., 8.4.
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> minor versions are represented by the
   third group of version digits, e.g., 8.4.2 is the second minor
   release of 8.4.  Minor releases never change the internal storage
   format and are always compatible with earlier and later minor
   releases of the same major version number, e.g., 8.4.2 is compatible
   with 8.4, 8.4.1 and 8.4.6.  To update between compatible versions,
   you simply replace the executables while the server is down and
   restart the server.  The data directory remains unchanged &mdash;
   minor upgrades are that simple.
  </para>

  <para>
   For <emphasis>major</> releases of <productname>PostgreSQL</>, the
   internal data storage format is subject to change, thus complicating
   upgrades.  The traditional method for moving data to a new major version
   is to dump and reload the database, though this can be slow.  A
   faster method is <xref linkend="pgupgrade">.  Replication methods are
   also available, as discussed below.
  </para>

  <para>
   New major versions also typically introduce some user-visible
   incompatibilities, so application programming changes might be required.
   All user-visible changes are listed in the release notes (<xref

   labeled "Migration".  If you are upgrading across several major
   versions, be sure to read the release notes for each intervening
   version.
  </para>

  <para>
   Cautious users will want to test their client applications on the new
   version before switching over fully; therefore, it's often a good idea to

      delete it, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.  Keep
      in mind the directory might consume significant disk space.  To rename
      the directory, use a command like this:
<screen>

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   While the server is running, it is not possible for a malicious user
   to take the place of the normal database server.  However, when the
   server is down, it is possible for a local user to spoof the normal
   server by starting their own server.  The spoof server could read
   passwords and queries sent by clients, but could not return any data
   because the <varname>PGDATA</> directory would still be secure because
   of directory permissions. Spoofing is possible because any user can
   start a database server; a client cannot identify an invalid server
   unless it is specially configured.
  </para>

  <para>
   The simplest way to prevent spoofing for <literal>local</>
   connections is to use a Unix domain socket directory (<xref
   linkend="guc-unix-socket-directories">) that has write permission only
   for a trusted local user.  This prevents a malicious user from creating
   their own socket file in that directory.  If you are concerned that
   some applications might still reference <filename>/tmp</> for the
   socket file and hence be vulnerable to spoofing, during operating system
   startup create a symbolic link <filename>/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432</> that points
   to the relocated socket file.  You also might need to modify your
   <filename>/tmp</> cleanup script to prevent removal of the symbolic link.
  </para>

  <para>
   To prevent spoofing on TCP connections, the best solution is to use
   SSL certificates and make sure that clients check the server's certificate.
   To do that, the server
   must be configured to accept only <literal>hostssl</> connections (<xref
   linkend="auth-pg-hba-conf">) and have SSL key and certificate files
   (<xref linkend="ssl-tcp">). The TCP client must connect using

  </para>

  <para>
   First make sure that an <application>SSH</application> server is
   running properly on the same machine as the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server and that you can log in using
   <command>ssh</command> as some user. Then you can establish a secure
   tunnel with a command like this from the client machine:
<programlisting>
ssh -L 63333:localhost:5432 joe@foo.com
</programlisting>
   The first number in the <option>-L</option> argument, 63333, is the
   port number of your end of the tunnel; it can be any unused port.
   (IANA reserves ports 49152 through 65535 for private use.)  The
   second number, 5432, is the remote end of the tunnel: the port
   number your server is using. The name or IP address between the
   port numbers is the host with the database server you are going to
   connect to, as seen from the host you are logging in to, which
   is <literal>foo.com</literal> in this example. In order to connect
   to the database server using this tunnel, you connect to port 63333
   on the local machine:
<programlisting>
psql -h localhost -p 63333 postgres
</programlisting>
   To the database server it will then look as though you are really
   user <literal>joe</literal> on host <literal>foo.com</literal>
   connecting to <literal>localhost</literal> in that context, and it
   will use whatever authentication procedure was configured for
   connections from this user and host.  Note that the server will not
   think the connection is SSL-encrypted, since in fact it is not
   encrypted between the
   <application>SSH</application> server and the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server.  This should not pose any
   extra security risk as long as they are on the same machine.

   terminal session.
  </para>

  <para>
   You could also have set up the port forwarding as
<programlisting>
ssh -L 63333:foo.com:5432 joe@foo.com
</programlisting>
   but then the database server will see the connection as coming in
   on its <literal>foo.com</literal> interface, which is not opened by
   the default setting <literal>listen_addresses =
   'localhost'</literal>.  This is usually not what you want.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have to <quote>hop</quote> to the database server via some
   login host, one possible setup could look like this:
<programlisting>
ssh -L 63333:db.foo.com:5432 joe@shell.foo.com
</programlisting>
   Note that this way the connection
   from <literal>shell.foo.com</literal>
   to <literal>db.foo.com</literal> will not be encrypted by the SSH
   tunnel.
   SSH offers quite a few configuration possibilities when the network
   is restricted in various ways.  Please refer to the SSH
   documentation for details.
