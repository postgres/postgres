the operating system.

<title>Using <Productname>Postgres</Productname> from Unix</title>

<para>
All <Productname>Postgres</Productname> commands that are executed 
directly from a Unix shell are
found in the directory <quote>.../bin</quote>.  Including this directory in
your search path will make executing the commands easier.
</para>
<para>
A collection of system catalogs exist at each site.  These include a
class (<literal>pg_user</literal>) that contains an instance for each valid
<Productname>Postgres</Productname> user.  The instance specifies a set of
 <Productname>Postgres</Productname> privileges, such as
the ability to act as <Productname>Postgres</Productname> super-user,
 the ability to create/destroy
databases, and the ability to update the system catalogs.  A Unix
user cannot do anything with <Productname>Postgres</Productname> 
until an appropriate instance is
installed in this class.  Further information on the system catalogs
is available by running queries on the appropriate classes.

shows how the <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName>  distribution  is  laid
     out  when installed in the default way. For simplicity,
     we will assume that <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName>
 has been installed in  the
     directory  <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename>.   Therefore, wherever
     you see the directory <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename> you  should
     substitute  the name of the directory where
 <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName> is
     actually installed.
     All <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName> commands are installed
     in  the  directory
     <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</filename>.   Therefore,  you should add
     this directory to your shell command path.  If you  use
     a variant of the Berkeley C shell, such as csh or tcsh,
     you would add
<ProgramListing>
set path = ( /usr/local/pgsql/bin path )
</ProgramListing>
     in the .login file in your home directory.  If you  use
     a  variant  of  the  Bourne  shell, such as sh, ksh, or
     bash, then you would add
<ProgramListing>
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin PATH
export PATH
</ProgramListing>
     to the .profile file in your home directory.
     From now on, we will assume that  you  have  added  the
     <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName>  bin  directory to your path.
     In addition, we
     will make frequent reference to "setting a shell  
     variable"  or  "setting an environment variable" throughout
     this document.  If you did  not  fully  understand  the
     last  paragraph  on  modifying  your  search  path, you
     should consult the UNIX manual pages that describe your
     shell before going any further.
</Para>

<Para>
If you have not set things up in the
default  way,  you may have some more work to do.  
For example, if the database server machine is a remote machine, you
will need to set the <envar>PGHOST</envar> environment variable to the name
of the database server machine.   The  environment  variable
<envar>PGPORT</envar> may also have to be set.  The bottom line is this: if
you try to start an application  program  and  it  complains
that it cannot connect to the <Application>postmaster</Application>,
you must go back and make sure that your
environment is properly set up.
