      Fix <filename>contrib/pgcrypto</filename> to detect and report
      too-short <function>crypt()</function> salts (Josh Kupershmidt)
     </para>

     <para>
      Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few
      bytes of server memory.  We have not ruled out the viability of
      attacks that arrange for presence of confidential information in the
      disclosed bytes, but they seem unlikely.  (CVE-2015-5288)

      Fix subtransaction cleanup after a portal (cursor) belonging to an

     </para>

     <para>
      A function executed in an outer-subtransaction cursor could cause an
      assertion failure or crash by referencing a relation created within an
      inner subtransaction.

      Fix insertion of relations into the relation cache <quote>init file</quote>
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases
      caused <structname>pg_trigger_tgrelid_tgname_index</structname> to be omitted
      from the init file.  Subsequent sessions detected this, then deemed the
      init file to be broken and silently ignored it, resulting in a
      significant degradation in session startup time.  In addition to fixing
      the bug, install some guards so that any similar future mistake will be
      more obvious.

      Disable SSL renegotiation by default (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have seen
      too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL library and
      in our usage of it.  Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and
      later.  In the older branches, just change the default value
      of <varname>ssl_renegotiation_limit</varname> to zero (disabled).

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</function>'ing data directory during
      crash restart (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</function>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would
      prevent restart on some platforms; but it is common to make SSL
      certificate files unwritable by the server.  Revise this behavior so
      that permissions failures are ignored altogether, and other types of
      failures are logged but do not prevent continuing.

      For a long time, <application>libpq</application> was coded so that the only SSL

      already capable of such negotiation, so no change is needed on the

      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</function> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.

      Remove code for matching IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> entries to

     <para>
      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</application>'s

     <para>
      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input

      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</literal>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</application>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <function>PQconsumeInput()</function> upon read-ready.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      The previous behavior resulted in basically ignoring these per-table

      will be vacuumed using those settings, independently of what is going
      on in other autovacuum workers.  This may result in heavier total I/O

      Avoid wholesale autovacuuming when autovacuum is nominally off
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Even when autovacuum is nominally off, we will still launch autovacuum
      worker processes to vacuum tables that are at risk of XID wraparound.
      However, such a worker process then proceeded to vacuum all tables in
      the target database, if they met the usual thresholds for
      autovacuuming.  This is at best pretty unexpected; at worst it delays
      response to the wraparound threat.  Fix it so that if autovacuum is
      turned off, workers <emphasis>only</emphasis> do anti-wraparound vacuums and
      not any other work.

      Support time zone abbreviations that change UTC offset from time to

      Previously, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> assumed that the UTC offset

      zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
      Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
      feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
      abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
      In such timezones, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will now associate the
      correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.

     <para>
      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <filename>/tmp</filename>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.

     <para>
      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <literal>make check</literal> testing in builds that
      override <literal>DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR</literal>.  Popular non-default values
      like <filename>/var/run/postgresql</filename> are often not writable by the
      build user, requiring workarounds that will no longer be necessary.

      Restore GIN metapages unconditionally to avoid torn-page risk

      Shore up <literal>GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION</literal> restrictions
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</literal> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET
      ROLE</literal> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can
      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal> functions.

      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

     <para>
      If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts.  At least in the case of <command>CREATE INDEX</command>,
      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed
      against a different table than the index creation, allowing for a
      privilege escalation attack.

      The <literal>MAXDATELEN</literal> constant was too small for the longest

      in <function>interval_out()</function>.  Although the datetime input
      functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the limit

      input containing a very long timezone name.  The <application>ecpg</application>

      Document risks of <literal>make check</literal> in the regression testing

     </para>

     <para>
      Since the temporary server started by <literal>make check</literal>
      uses <quote>trust</quote> authentication, another user on the same machine
      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <literal>make check</literal> when there are untrusted users on the
      same machine.

      The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially many

      Fix <command>VACUUM</command>'s tests to see whether it can
      update <structfield>relfrozenxid</structfield> (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In some cases <command>VACUUM</command> (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's <structfield>relfrozenxid</structfield> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  Users
      upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8 or earlier are not affected, but
      all later versions contain the bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</varname></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <literal>SELECT txid_current() &lt; 2^31</literal>).

      Fix initialization of <filename>pg_clog</filename> and <filename>pg_subtrans</filename>
      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.

     <para>
      These errors could result in inconsistent indexes in which some keys

      that are unnecessarily inefficient to search.  Users are advised to
      <command>REINDEX</command> multi-column GiST indexes after installing this

     <para>
      Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore time, for example
      if the reason the index creation failed was because it tried to enforce
      a uniqueness condition not satisfied by the table's data.  Also, if the
      index creation is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to

      <application>pg_dump</application> wouldn't be expected to dump anyway.

      Fix performance problems with autovacuum truncation in busy workloads
      (Jan Wieck)
     </para>

     <para>
      Truncation of empty pages at the end of a table requires exclusive
      lock, but autovacuum was coded to fail (and release the table lock)
      when there are conflicting lock requests.  Under load, it is easily
      possible that truncation would never occur, resulting in table bloat.
      Fix by performing a partial truncation, releasing the lock, then
      attempting to re-acquire the lock and continue.  This fix also greatly
      reduces the average time before autovacuum releases the lock after a
      conflicting request arrives.

      Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references
      (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <function>xml_parse()</function> would attempt to fetch external files or
      URLs as needed to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value,
      thus allowing unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data
      with the privileges of the database server.  While the external data
      wouldn't get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be
      exposed in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and
      in any case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be
      useful to an attacker.  (CVE-2012-3489)

      Prevent access to external files/URLs via <filename>contrib/xml2</filename>'s
      <function>xslt_process()</function> (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libxslt</application> offers the ability to read and write both
      files and URLs through stylesheet commands, thus allowing
      unprivileged database users to both read and write data with the
      privileges of the database server.  Disable that through proper use
      of <application>libxslt</application>'s security options.  (CVE-2012-3488)
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, remove <function>xslt_process()</function>'s ability to fetch documents
      and stylesheets from external files/URLs.  While this was a
      documented <quote>feature</quote>, it was long regarded as a bad idea.
      The fix for CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than
      expend effort on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily
      remove it.

      Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
      introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
      recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
      This would result in incorrect index search results.  The probability
      of such an error occurring in the field seems very low because of the
      timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be fixed.

      Fix crash-safety bug with newly-created-or-reset sequences (Tom Lane)

      If <command>ALTER SEQUENCE</command> was executed on a freshly created or
      reset sequence, and then precisely one <function>nextval()</function> call
      was made on it, and then the server crashed, WAL replay would restore
      the sequence to a state in which it appeared that no
      <function>nextval()</function> had been done, thus allowing the first
      sequence value to be returned again by the next
      <function>nextval()</function> call.  In particular this could manifest for

      This situation can arise in <command>CREATE TABLE</command> with

      <literal>INHERITS</literal> we should ideally allow it, with an implicit
      coercion to the parent table's row type; but that will require more
      work than seems safe to back-patch.

      This avoids some corner-case problems, notably that Python doesn't
      support all the encodings Postgres does.  A notable functional change
      is that if the server encoding is SQL_ASCII, you will get the UTF-8

      If a password string contained the byte value <literal>0x80</literal>, the

      Both <application>libpq</application> and the server truncated the common name
      extracted from an SSL certificate at 32 bytes.  Normally this would
      cause nothing worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there
      are some rather-implausible scenarios in which it might allow one
      certificate holder to impersonate another.  The victim would have to
      have a common name exactly 32 bytes long, and the attacker would have
      to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the common
      name has that string as a prefix.  Impersonating a server would also
      require some additional exploit to redirect client connections.

      Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with vacuuming
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a
      concurrently-running <command>VACUUM</command> to miss removing index entries
      that it should remove.  After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as <quote>could not
      read block N in file ...</quote>) or worse, silently wrong query results
      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations.
      This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently
      that it was not diagnosed until now.  If you have reason to suspect
      that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index
      will fix things.

      Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table files post-commit
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files only
      after the transaction commits.  In event of failure then (for instance,
      because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed to just emit a
      warning message and go on, since it's too late to abort the
      transaction.  This logic got broken as of release 8.4, causing such
      situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable database.

      Recover from errors occurring during WAL replay of <command>DROP

     <para>
      Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's directories, but there
      are various reasons why this might fail (for example, incorrect
      ownership or permissions on those directories).  Formerly the replay
      code would panic, rendering the database unrestartable without manual
      intervention.  It seems better to log the problem and continue, since
      the only consequence of failure to remove the directories is some
      wasted disk space.

      Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high value until the
      system exited replay mode.  The practical consequences of that are
      usually nil, but there are scenarios wherein a standby server that's
      been promoted to master might take a long time to advance the OID
      counter to a reasonable value once values are needed.

    However, a longstanding error was discovered in the definition of the
    <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</literal> view.  If you
    rely on correct results from that view, you should replace its
    definition as explained in the first changelog item below.

      Fix bugs in <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</literal> view
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the view definition is installed by <application>initdb</application>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this
      in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the
      <literal>information_schema</literal> schema then re-create it by sourcing
      <filename><replaceable>SHAREDIR</replaceable>/information_schema.sql</filename>.
      (Run <literal>pg_config --sharedir</literal> if you're uncertain where
      <replaceable>SHAREDIR</replaceable> is.)  This must be repeated in each database
      to be fixed.

      paths that could trigger the same bug.

      Track dependencies of functions on items used in parameter default

     <para>
      Previously, a referenced object could be dropped without having dropped
      or modified the function, leading to misbehavior when the function was
      used.  Note that merely installing this update will not fix the missing
      dependency entries; to do that, you'd need to <command>CREATE OR
      REPLACE</command> each such function afterwards.  If you have functions whose
      defaults depend on non-built-in objects, doing so is recommended.

      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</literal> trigger and the
      <literal>CHECK</literal> trigger as one event.  The <literal>ON UPDATE</literal>
      trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</literal> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</quote>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

   <para>
    However, if your installation was upgraded from a previous major
    release by running <application>pg_upgrade</application>, you should take
    action to prevent possible data loss due to a now-fixed bug in
    <application>pg_upgrade</application>.  The recommended solution is to run
    <command>VACUUM FREEZE</command> on all TOAST tables.

      Fix <application>pg_upgrade</application>'s handling of TOAST tables
      (Bruce Momjian)
     </para>

     <para>
      The <structname>pg_class</structname>.<structfield>relfrozenxid</structfield> value for
      TOAST tables was not correctly copied into the new installation
      during <application>pg_upgrade</application>.  This could later result in
      <literal>pg_clog</literal> files being discarded while they were still
      needed to validate tuples in the TOAST tables, leading to
      <quote>could not access status of transaction</quote> failures.
     </para>

     <para>
      This error poses a significant risk of data loss for installations
      that have been upgraded with <application>pg_upgrade</application>.  This patch
      corrects the problem for future uses of <application>pg_upgrade</application>,
      but does not in itself cure the issue in installations that have been
      processed with a buggy version of <application>pg_upgrade</application>.

      Any variation in the table row types (including dropped columns present

      Fix assignment to an array slice that is before the existing range

      If there was a gap between the newly added subscripts and the first
      pre-existing subscript, the code miscalculated how many entries needed
      to be copied from the old array's null bitmap, potentially leading to
      data corruption or crash.

      Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl and
      PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by subverting
      Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same session under
      another SQL user identity (for example, within a <literal>SECURITY
      DEFINER</literal> function).  Most scripting languages offer numerous ways that
      that might be done, such as redefining standard functions or operators
      called by the target function.  Without this change, any SQL user with
      Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with the
      SQL privileges of the target function's owner.
     </para>

     <para>
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among Perl
      and Tcl functions becomes more difficult.  To provide an escape hatch,
      PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one interpreter
      per session.  This is not considered a security issue since all such
      functions execute at the trust level of a database superuser already.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to offer
      trusted execution have similar security issues.  We advise contacting
      the authors of any PL you are depending on for security-critical
      purposes.

   <title>Overview</title>

   <para>
    This release of
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> adds features that have been requested
    for years, such as easy-to-use replication, a mass permission-changing
    facility, and anonymous code blocks. While past major releases have
    been conservative in their scope, this release shows a
    bold new desire to provide facilities that new and existing
    users of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will embrace. This has all
    been done with few incompatibilities. Major enhancements include:

     <para>
      Built-in replication based on log shipping.  This advance consists of
      two features: Streaming Replication, allowing continuous archive
      (<acronym>WAL</acronym>) files to be streamed over a network connection to a
      standby server, and Hot Standby, allowing continuous archive standby
      servers to execute read-only queries.  The net effect is to support a
      single master with multiple read-only slave servers.

     Also, <literal>^</literal> and <literal>$</literal> are now treated as simple
     literal characters; formerly they were treated as metacharacters,
     as if the pattern were following POSIX rather than SQL rules.
     Also, in SQL-standard <function>substring()</function>, use of parentheses
     for nesting no longer interferes with capturing of a substring.

      PL/pgSQL now throws an error if a variable name conflicts with a
      column name used in a query (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The former behavior was to bind ambiguous names to PL/pgSQL variables
      in preference to query columns, which often resulted in surprising
      misbehavior. Throwing an error allows easy detection of ambiguous
      situations.  Although it's recommended that functions encountering this
      type of error be modified to remove the conflict, the old behavior can
      be restored if necessary via the configuration parameter <link
      linkend="plpgsql-var-subst"><varname>plpgsql.variable_conflict</varname></link>,
      or via the per-function option <literal>#variable_conflict</literal>.

      PL/pgSQL no longer allows variable names that match certain SQL
      reserved words (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      This is a consequence of aligning the PL/pgSQL parser to match the
      core SQL parser more closely.  If necessary,
      variable names can be double-quoted to avoid this restriction.

     <para>
      PL/pgSQL now requires columns of composite results to match the
      expected type modifier as well as base type (Pavel Stehule, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For example, if a column of the result type is declared as
      <literal>NUMERIC(30,2)</literal>, it is no longer acceptable to return a
      <literal>NUMERIC</literal> of some other precision in that column.  Previous
      versions neglected to check the type modifier and would thus allow
      result rows that didn't actually conform to the declared restrictions.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      PL/pgSQL now treats selection into composite fields more consistently
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Formerly, a statement like
      <literal>SELECT ... INTO <replaceable>rec</replaceable>.<replaceable>fld</replaceable> FROM ...</literal>
      was treated as a scalar assignment even if the record field
      <replaceable>fld</replaceable> was of composite type.  Now it is treated as a
      record assignment, the same as when the <literal>INTO</literal> target is a
      regular variable of composite type.  So the values to be assigned to the
      field's subfields should be written as separate columns of the
      <command>SELECT</command> list, not as a <literal>ROW(...)</literal> construct as in
      previous versions.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you need to do this in a way that will work in both 9.0 and previous
      releases, you can write something like
      <literal><replaceable>rec</replaceable>.<replaceable>fld</replaceable> := ROW(...) FROM ...</literal>.

       useful for time periods and other ranges, as well as arrays.
       This feature enhances checking of data integrity for many

      Allow <link linkend="datatype-binary"><type>bytea</type></link> values

     <para>
      The server parameter <link
      linkend="guc-bytea-output"><varname>bytea_output</varname></link> controls
      whether hex or traditional format is used for <type>bytea</type>

      correctly process hex format from newer servers.
     </para>

     <para>
      The new hex format will be directly compatible with more applications
      that use binary data, allowing them to store and retrieve it without
