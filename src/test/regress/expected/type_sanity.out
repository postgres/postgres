-- TYPE_SANITY
-- Sanity checks for common errors in making type-related system tables:
-- pg_type, pg_class, pg_attribute.
--
-- None of the SELECTs here should ever find any matching entries,
-- so the expected output is easy to maintain ;-).
-- A test failure indicates someone messed up an entry in the system tables.
--
-- NB: we assume the oidjoins test will have caught any dangling links,
-- that is OID or REGPROC fields that are not zero and do not match some
-- row in the linked-to table.  However, if we want to enforce that a link
-- field can't be 0, we have to check it here.
-- **************** pg_type ****************
-- Look for illegal values in pg_type fields.
