My 2 cents, or 2 ören since I'm a Swede, on this:

It is pretty simple to build a replication with pg_dump, transfer,
empty replic and reload.
But if we want "live replicas" we better base our efforts on a
mechanism using WAL-logs to rollforward the replicas.

Interesting idea.  I can see how this might sync up two databases
somehow.  For true replication, however, I would always want every
replicated database to be, at the very least, internally consistent
(i.e., referential integrity), even if it was a little behind on
processing transactions.  In this method, its not clear how
consistency is every achieved/guaranteed at any point in time if the
input stream of changes is continuous.  If the input stream ceased,
then I can see how this approach might eventually catch up and totally
resync everything, but it looks *very* computationally  expensive.

But I might have missed something.  How would internal consistency be
maintained?

My two cents is that, while I can see this kind of database syncing as
valuable, this is not the kind of "replication" I had in mind.  This
may already possible by simply copying the database.  What replication
means to me is a live, continuously streaming sequence of updates from
one database to another where the replicated database is always
internally consistent, available for read-only queries, and never "too
far" out of sync with the source/primary database.

What does replication mean to others?

Cheers,
Ed Loehr

    What's the typical unit of work for the database?  Are we talking about
update transactions which span the entire DB?  Or are we talking about
updating maybe 1% or less of the database everyday?  I'd think it would be
more towards the latter than the former.  So, yes, this process would be
computationally expensive but how many records would actually have to be
sent back and forth?

    Updates that occur at site A will be moved to site B and vice versa.
Consistency would be maintained.  The only problem that I can see right off
the bat would be what if site A and site B made changes to a row and then
site C was brought into the picture?  Which one wins?

    Someone *has* to win when it comes to this type of thing.  You really
DON'T want to start merging row changes...

    Sounds like you're talking about distributed transactions to me.  That's
an entirely different subject all-together.  What you describe can be done
by copying a database...but as you say, this would only work in a read-only
situation.

	I too have been thinking about this some over the last year or
two, just trying to find a quick and easy way to do it. I am not so
interested in replication, as in synchronization, as in between a desktop
machine and a laptop, so I can keep the databases on each in sync with
each other. For this sort of purpose, both the local and remote databases
would be "idle" at the time of syncing.

	How about a single, seperate table with the fields of 'database',
'tablename', 'oid', 'last_changed', that would store the same data as your
PGR_TIME field. It would be seperated from the actually data tables, and
therefore would be totally transparent to any database interface
applications. The 'oid' field would hold each row's OID, a nice, unique
identification number for the row, while the other fields would tell which
table and database the oid is in. Then this table can be compared with the
this table on a remote machine to quickly find updates and changes, then
each differences can be dealt with in turn.

	I like this idea, better than any I have come up with yet. Though,
how are you going to handle DELETEs?

	Yea, this is indeed the sticky part, and would indeed require some
fine-tunning. Basically, the way I see it, is if the two timestamps for a
single row do not match (or even if the row and therefore timestamp is
missing on one side or the other altogether):
	local ts > remote ts => Local row is exported to remote.
	remote ts > local ts => Remote row is exported to local.
	local ts > last sync time && no remote ts => 
		Local row is inserted on remote.
	local ts < last sync time && no remote ts =>
		Local row is deleted.
	remote ts > last sync time && no local ts =>
		Remote row is inserted on local.
	remote ts < last sync time && no local ts =>
		Remote row is deleted.
where the synchronization process is running on the local machine. By
exported, I mean the local values are sent to the remote machine, and the
row on that remote machine is updated to the local values. How does this
sound?

	Or run manually for my purposes. Also, maybe follow it
with a vacuum run on both sides for all databases, as this is going to

	Initially, I would just stick to user table data... If you have
changes in triggers and other meta-data/executable code, you are going to
want to make syncs of that stuff manually anyway. At least I would want
to.

	Hence the reason for the seperate table with just a row's
identification and last update time. Only modifications to the synced
database is the update trigger, which should be pretty harmless.

	Just run the sync program as the postgres super user, and there
are no problems. :)

	No, not at all. Though it probably should be remaned from
replication to synchronization. The former is usually associated with a
continuous stream of updates between the local and remote databases, so
they are almost always in sync, and have a queuing ability if their
connection is loss for span of time as well. Very complex and difficult to
implement, and would require hacking server code. :( Something only Sybase
and Oracle have (as far as I know), and from what I have seen of Sybase's
replication server support (dated by 5yrs) it was a pain to setup and get
running correctly.
	The latter, synchronization, is much more managable, and can still
be useful, especially when you have a large database you want in two
places, mainly for read only purposes at one end or the other, but don't
want to waste the time/bandwidth to move and load the entire database each
time it changes on one end or the other. Same idea as mirroring software
for FTP sites, just transfers the changes, and nothing more.
	I also like the idea of using Python. I have been using it
recently for some database interfaces (to PostgreSQL of course :), and it
is a very nice language to work with. Some worries about performance of
the program though, as python is only an interpreted lanuage, and I have
yet to really be impressed with the speed of execution of my database
interfaces yet.
	Anyway, it sound like a good project, and finally one where I
actually have a clue of what is going on, and the skills to help. So, if
you are interested in pursing this project, I would be more than glad to
help. TTYL.

    I don't think it would matter if the databases are idle or not to be
honest with you.  At any single point in time when you replicate I'd figure
that the database would be in a consistent state.  So, you should be able to
replicate (or sync) a remote database that is in use.  After all, you're
getting a snapshot of the database as it stands at 8:45 PM.  At 8:46 PM it
may be totally different...but the next time syncing takes place those
changes would appear in your local copy.

    The one problem you may run into is if the remote host is running a
large batch process.  It's very likely that you will get 50% of their
changes when you replicate...but then again, that's why you can schedule the
event to work around such things.

    The problem with OID's is that they are unique at the local level but if
you try and use them between servers you can run into overlap.  Also, if a
database is under heavy use this table could quickly become VERY large.  Add
indexes to this table to help performance and you're taking up even more
disk space.

    Using the PGR_TIME field with an index will allow us to find rows which
have changed VERY quickly.  All we need to do now is somehow programatically
find the primary key for a table so the person setting up replication (or
syncing) doesn't have to have an indepth knowledge of the schema in order to
setup a syncing schedule.

    The replication part will be the most complex...that much is for
certain...

    I've been writing systems in Lotus Notes/Domino for the last year or so
and I've grown quite spoiled with what it can do in regards to replication.
It's not real-time but you have to gear your applications to this type of
thing (it's possible to create documents, fire off email to notify people of
changes and have the email arrive before the replicated documents do).
Replicating large Notes/Domino databases takes quite a while....I don't see
any kind of replication or syncing running in a blink of an eye.

    Having said that, a good algo will have to be written to cut down on
network traffic and to keep database conversations down to a minimum.  This
will be appreciated by people with low bandwidth connections I'm sure
(dial-ups, fractional T1's, etc).

    It could probably be named either way...but the one thing I really don't
want to do is start hacking server code.  The PostgreSQL people have enough
to do without worrying about trying to meld anything I've done to their
server.   :)

    Besides, I like the idea of having it operate as a stand-alone product.
The only PostgreSQL feature we would require would be triggers and
plpgsql...what was the earliest version of PostgreSQL that supported
plpgsql?  Even then I don't see the triggers being that complex to boot.

    The only thing we'd need for Python is the Python extensions for
PostgreSQL...which in turn requires libpq and that's about it.  So, it
should be able to run on any platform supported by Python and libpq.  Using
TK for the interface components will require NT people to get additional
software from the 'net.  At least it did with older version of Windows
Python.  Unix folks should be happy....assuming they have X running on the
machine doing the replication or syncing.  Even then I wrote a curses based
Python interface awhile back which allows buttons, progress bars, input
fields, etc (I called it tinter and it's available at
http://iximd.com/~dwalker).  It's a simple interface and could probably be
cleaned up a bit but it works.  :)

    That would be a Good Thing.  Have webspace somewhere?  If I can get
permission from the "powers that be" at the office I could host a website on
our (Domino) webserver.

	Yea, forgot about that point, but became dead obvious once you

	Hmm... Yea, maybe look to see which field(s) has a primary, unique
index on it? Then use those field(s) as a primary key. Just require that
any table to be synchronized to have some set of fields that uniquely
identify each row. Either that, or add another field to each table with
our own, cross system consistent, identification system. Don't know which
would be more efficient and easier to work with.
	The former could potentially get sticky if it takes a lots of
fields to generate a unique key value, but has the smallest effect on the
table to be synced. The latter could be difficult to keep straight between
systems (local vs. remote), and would require a trigger on inserts to
generate a new, unique id number, that does not exist locally or
remotely (nasty issue there), but would remove the uniqueness
requirement.

	Or, according to my logic below, if a row is missing on one side
or the other, then just compare the remaining row's timestamp to the last
synchronization time (stored in a seperate table/db elsewhere). The
results of the comparsion and the state of row existences tell one if the
row was inserted or deleted since the last sync, and what should be done
to perform the sync.

	Of course! In reflection, the assigned identification number I
mentioned above might be the best then, instead of having to transfer the
entire set of key fields back and forth.

>     What would a vacuum do to a system being used by many people?

	Probably lock them out of tables while they are vacuumed... Maybe
not really required in the end, possibly optional?

	Yea, they probably would appreciate that. They already have enough
on thier plate for 7.x as it is! :)

	No, provided that we don't do the identification number idea
(which the more I think about it, probably will not work). As for what
version support plpgsql, I don't know, one of the more hard-core pgsql
hackers can probably tell us that.

	Of course. If it ran on NT as well as Linux/Unix, that would be
even better. :)

	Why would we want any type of GUI (X11 or curses) for this sync
program. I imagine just a command line program with a few options (local
machine, remote machine, db name, etc...), and nothing else.
	Though I will take a look at your curses interface, as I have been
wanting to make a curses interface to a few db interfaces I have, in a
simple as manner as possible.

	Yea, I got my own web server (www.rkirkpat.net) with 1GB+ of disk
space available, sitting on a decent speed DSL. Even can setup of a
virtual server if we want (i.e. pgsync.rkirkpat.net :). CVS repository,
email lists, etc... possible with some effort (and time). 
	So, where should we start? TTYL.

	PS. The current pages on my web site are very out of date at the
moment (save for the pgsql information). I hope to have updated ones up
within the week.

Hi Guys,

Now for one of my REALLY rare posts.
Having done a little bit of distributed data systems, I figured I'd
pitch in a couple cents worth.

>    table in each database that needs to be re plicated. &nbsp;This

I just started reading this thread, but I figured I'd throw in a couple
suggestions for distributed data control  (a few idioms I've had to
deal with b4):
	- Never use time (not reliable from system to system).  Use
	  a version number of some sort that can stay consistent across
	  all replicas

	  This way, if a system's time is or goes out of wack, it doesn't
	  cause your database to disintegrate, and it's easier to track
	  conflicts (see below.  If using time, the algorithm gets
	  nightmarish)

	- On an insert, set to version 1

	- On an update, version++

	- On a delete, mark deleted, and add a delete stub somewhere for the
	  replicator process to deal with in sync'ing the databases.

	- If two records have the same version but different data, there's
	  a conflict.  A few choices:
	  	1.  Pick one as the correct one (yuck!! invisible data loss)
		2.  Store both copies, pick one as current, and alert 
		    database owner of the conflict, so they can deal with
		    it "manually."
		3.  If possible, some conflicts can be merged.  If a disjoint
		    set of fields were changed in each instance, these changes
		    may both be applied and the record merged.  (Problem:
		    takes a lot more space.  Requires a version number for
		    every field, or persistent storage of some old records.
		    However, this might help the "which fields changed" issue
		    you were talking about in #6)

	- A unique id across all systems should exist (or something that
	  effectively simulates a unique id.  Maybe a composition of the
	  originating oid (from the insert) and the originating database
	  (oid of the database's record?) might do it.  Store this as
	  an extra field in every record.  
	  
	  (Two extra fieldss so far: 'unique id' and 'version')

I do like your approach:  triggers and a separate process. (Maintainable!! :)

Anyway, just figured I'd throw in a few suggestions,
Duane

Hi all!

Here is a small patch to make postgres a distributed database. By
distributed I mean that you can have the same copy of the database on N
different machines and keep them all in sync.
It does not improve performances unless you distribute your clients in a
sensible manner. It does not allow you to do parallel selects.

The support page is : pages.infinit.net/daemon  and soon to be in
english.

The patch was tested with RedHat Linux 6.0 on Intel with kernel 2.2.11.
Only two machines where used so i'm not competely sure that it works
with more than two. -But it should-

I would like to know if somebody else is interested in this otherwise
i'm probably not gonna keep it growing. So please reply me to my e-mail
(P.Marchesso@videotron.ca) to give me an idea of the amount of people
interested in this.

Thanks all.

Philippe Marchesseault

Hi,

I look at your (Philippe's) replicator, but I don't good understand
your replication concept.


    node1:  SQL --IPC--> node-broker
                       |
                      TCP/IP
                       |
                    master-node --IPC--> replikator
                                         |   |   |
                                           libpq
                                         |   |   |
                                       node2 node..n     

(Is it right picture?)

If I good understand, all nodes make connection to master node and data
replicate "replicator" on this master node. But it (master node) is very
critical space in this concept - If master node not work replication for 
*all* nodes is lost. Hmm.. but I want use replication for high available
applications...

IMHO is problem with node registration / authentification on master node.
Why concept is not more upright? As:

	SQL --IPC--> node-replicator
			|  |  | 
		     via libpq send data to all nodes with
                     current client/backend auth.

	(not exist any master node, all nodes have connection to all nodes)	


Use replicator as external proces and copy data from SQL to this replicator
via IPC is (your) very good idea.

 Hi,

 I a little explore replication conception on Oracle and Sybase (in manuals).
(Know anyone some interesting links or publication about it?)

 Firstly, I sure, untimely is write replication to PgSQL now, if we
haven't exactly conception for it. It need more suggestion from more
developers. We need firstly answers for next qestion:

	1/ How replication concept choose for PG?
	2/ How manage transaction for nodes? (and we need define any 
           replication protocol for this)
	3/ How involve replication in current PG transaction code?

My idea (dream:-) is replication that allow you use full read-write on all
nodes and replication which use current transaction method in PG - not is
difference between more backends on one host or more backend on more hosts
- it makes "global transaction consistency".

Now is transaction manage via ICP (one host), my dream is alike manage 
this transaction, but between more host via TCP. (And make optimalization 
for this - transfer commited data/commands only.)


Any suggestion?


-------------------
Note:
 
(transaction oriented replication)

 Sybase - I. model (only one node is read-write) 

	 primary SQL data (READ-WRITE)
                |
	 replication agent (transaction log monitoring)
		|
	 primary distribution server (one or more repl. servers)
	        |               /  |  \
                |            nodes (READ-ONLY)
                |
         secondary dist. server
                          /  |  \
                       nodes (READ-ONLY)


       If primary SQL is read-write and the other nodes *read-only* 
       => system good work if connection is disable (data are save to
          replication-log and if connection is available log is write 
	  to node).   


 Sybase - II. model (all nodes read-write)

     	    SQL data 1 --->--+                        NODE I.
                |            |
                ^            |
	        |     replication agent 1 (transaction log monitoring)
                V        |
		|        V
                |        |
         replication server 1
                |
		^
                V
                |
         replication server 2                        NODE II.
                |         |
                ^         +-<-->--- SQL data 2
                |                    |                      
               replcation agent 2 -<--



Sorry, I not sure if I re-draw previous picture total good..

Two way replication on a single "table" is availabe in Lotus Notes. In
Notes, every record has a time-stamp, which contains the time of the
last update. (It also has a creation timestamp.) During replication,
timestamps are compared at the row/record level, and compared with the
timestamp of the last replication. If, for corresponding rows in two
replicas, the timestamp of one row is newer than the last replication,
the contents of this newer row is copied to the other replica. But if
both of the corresponding rows have newer timestamps, there is a
problem. The Lotus Notes solution is to:
  1. send a replication conflict message to the Notes Administrator,
which message contains full copies of both rows.
  2. copy the newest row over the less new row in the replicas.
  3. there is a mechanism for the Administrator to reverse the default
decision in 2, if the semantics of the message history, or off-line
investigation indicates that the wrong decision was made.

In practice, the Administrator is not overwhelmed with replication
conflict messages because updates usually only originate at the site
that originally created the row. Or updates fill only fields that were
originally 'TBD'. The full logic is perhaps more complicated than I have
described here, but it is already complicated enough to give you an idea
of what you're really being asked to do. I am not aware of a supplier of
relational database who really supports two way replication at the level
that Notes supports it, but Notes isn't a relational database.

The difficulty of the position that you appear to be in is that
management might believe that the full problem is solved in brand X
RDBMS, and you will have trouble convincing management that this is not
really true.
