How to keep track of all the trademarks? I'll try the strategy used at

There is no legal requirement to make trademark acknowledgements in
references to third party products that happen to have trademarked
names.

The exception would be if PostgreSQL were to license a particular
trademark and the trademark holder makes this requirement (as in the
case of UNIX and Java).

What is not allowed, however, is to use a trademark name in a way that
could lead people to believe that they label PostgreSQL products.
E.g., "the PostgreSQL UNIX database system" would probably be illegal,
whereas "PostgreSQL, which runs on many UNIX computer systems" is
fine.  This is independent of whether a trademark acknowledgement is
made.
