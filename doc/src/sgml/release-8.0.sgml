     <para>
      Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl and
      PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by subverting
      Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same session under
      another SQL user identity (for example, within a <literal>SECURITY
      DEFINER</literal> function).  Most scripting languages offer numerous ways that
      that might be done, such as redefining standard functions or operators
      called by the target function.  Without this change, any SQL user with
      Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with the
      SQL privileges of the target function's owner.
     </para>

     <para>
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among Perl
      and Tcl functions becomes more difficult.  To provide an escape hatch,
      PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one interpreter
      per session.  This is not considered a security issue since all such
      functions execute at the trust level of a database superuser already.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to offer
      trusted execution have similar security issues.  We advise contacting
      the authors of any PL you are depending on for security-critical
      purposes.
     </para>

      This omission could result in corrupted lockfile contents if the

     <para>
      Enforce restrictions in <literal>plperl</literal> using an opmask applied to
      the whole interpreter, instead of using <filename>Safe.pm</filename>
      (Tim Bunce, Andrew Dunstan)
     </para>

     <para>
      Recent developments have convinced us that <filename>Safe.pm</filename> is too
      insecure to rely on for making <literal>plperl</literal> trustable.  This
      change removes use of <filename>Safe.pm</filename> altogether, in favor of using
      a separate interpreter with an opcode mask that is always applied.
      Pleasant side effects of the change include that it is now possible to
      use Perl's <literal>strict</literal> pragma in a natural way in
      <literal>plperl</literal>, and that Perl's <literal>$a</literal> and <literal>$b</literal>
      variables work as expected in sort routines, and that function
      compilation is significantly faster.  (CVE-2010-1169)

     <para>
      Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from
      <structname>pltcl_modules</structname> (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from a database table
      could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks, because there was no
      restriction on who could create or insert into that table.  This change
      disables the feature unless <structname>pltcl_modules</structname> is owned by a
      superuser.  (However, the permissions on the table are not checked, so
      installations that really need a less-than-secure modules table can
      still grant suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.)  Also,
      prevent loading code into the unrestricted <quote>normal</quote> Tcl
      interpreter unless we are really going to execute a <literal>pltclu</literal>
      function.  (CVE-2010-1170)

      Do not allow an unprivileged user to reset superuser-only parameter

      Previously, if an unprivileged user ran <literal>ALTER USER ... RESET
      ALL</literal> for himself, or <literal>ALTER DATABASE ... RESET ALL</literal> for
      a database he owns, this would remove all special parameter settings
      for the user or database, even ones that are only supposed to be
      changeable by a superuser.  Now, the <command>ALTER</command> will only
      remove the parameters that the user has permission to change.

      Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
      related failure scenarios.  The previous fixes were narrowly tailored
      for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> error thrown by an encoding conversion function could
      potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the
      error.  The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding
      conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message,
      if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

      Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be dumped

      be <literal>(-42)::integer</literal> due to operator precedence rules.

     <para>
      In rare cases a session that had just executed a

      one would be expected because the concurrent transaction executing
      <command>NOTIFY</command> was observed to commit later.

     <para>
      A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed
      a not-yet-committed <command>LISTEN</command> command will not see any
      row in <structname>pg_listener</structname> for the <command>LISTEN</command>,
      should it choose to look; formerly it would have.  This behavior
      was never documented one way or the other, but it is possible that

      Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
      the user running <command>VACUUM</command>, <command>ANALYZE</command>, etc (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Functions used in index expressions and partial-index
      predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made.  It has
      long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code
      execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user.
      (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the
      same type of risk.)  But functions in indexes pose extra danger
      because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations
      such as <command>VACUUM FULL</command>, which are commonly performed
      automatically under a superuser account.  For example, a nefarious user
      can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a
      trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum.
      The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations
      (including <command>VACUUM</command>, <command>ANALYZE</command>, <command>REINDEX</command>,
      and <command>CLUSTER</command>) to execute as the table owner rather than
      the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already
      used for <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal> functions.  To prevent bypassing
      this security measure, execution of <command>SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</command> and <command>SET ROLE</command> is now forbidden within a
      <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal> context.  (CVE-2007-6600)

    Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
    CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application
    code.  If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings
    into SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to
    ensure that they are using recommended escaping techniques.  In
    most cases, applications should be using subroutines provided by
    libraries or drivers (such as <application>libpq</application>'s
    <function>PQescapeStringConn()</function>) to perform string escaping,
    rather than relying on <foreignphrase>ad hoc</foreignphrase> code to do it.

<listitem><para>Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte
characters in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)</para>
<para>While <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has been moving in this direction for
some time, the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings.  This change
defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described in CVE-2006-2313.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Reject unsafe uses of <literal>\'</literal> in string literals</para>
<para>As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts <literal>''</literal> and not
<literal>\'</literal> as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
literals.  By default, <literal>\'</literal> is rejected only when
<varname>client_encoding</varname> is set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK,
GB18030, or UHC), which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible.
A new configuration parameter <varname>backslash_quote</varname> is available to
adjust this behavior when needed.  Note that full security against
CVE-2006-2314 might require client-side changes; the purpose of
<varname>backslash_quote</varname> is in part to make it obvious that insecure
clients are insecure.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Modify <application>libpq</application>'s string-escaping routines to be
aware of encoding considerations and

<para>This fixes <application>libpq</application>-using applications for the security
issues described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also future-proofs
them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard string literal syntax.
Applications that use multiple <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> connections
concurrently should migrate to <function>PQescapeStringConn()</function> and
<function>PQescapeByteaConn()</function> to ensure that escaping is done correctly
for the settings in use in each database connection.  Applications that
do string escaping <quote>by hand</quote> should be modified to rely on library
routines instead.

   <title>Migration to Version 8.0.3</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X.  However,
    it is one possible way of handling two significant security problems
    that have been found in the initial contents of 8.0.X system
    catalogs.  A dump/initdb/reload sequence using 8.0.3's initdb will
    automatically correct these problems.
   </para>

   <para>
    The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
    conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
    users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
    secure against malicious choices of arguments.  The fix involves changing
    the declared parameter list of these functions so that they can no longer
    be invoked from SQL commands.  (This does not affect their normal use
    by the encoding conversion machinery.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The lesser problem is that the <filename>contrib/tsearch2</filename> module
    creates several functions that are improperly declared to return
    <type>internal</type> when they do not accept <type>internal</type> arguments.
    This breaks type safety for all functions using <type>internal</type>
    arguments.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors,
    either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given
    below.  The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash
    their server process, and might allow unprivileged users to gain the
    privileges of a database superuser.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the same manual repair
    procedures shown in the <link linkend="release-7-4-8">7.4.8 release

    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> libraries, so it might be
    necessary to re-link some user applications if they cannot
    find the properly-numbered shared library.

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Increment the major version number of all interface
libraries (Bruce)</para>
<para>
This should have been done in 8.0.0.  It is required so 7.4.X versions
of PostgreSQL client applications, like <application>psql</application>,
can be used on the same machine as 8.0.X applications.  This might require
re-linking user applications that use these libraries.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Add Windows-only <varname>wal_sync_method</varname> setting of
<option>fsync_writethrough</option> (Magnus, Bruce)</para>
<para>
This setting causes <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to write through
any disk-drive write cache when writing to WAL.
This behavior was formerly called <option>fsync</option>, but was
renamed because it acts quite differently from <option>fsync</option> on other
platforms.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Enable the <varname>wal_sync_method</varname> setting of
<option>open_datasync</option> on Windows, and make it the default for that
 platform (Magnus, Bruce)</para>
<para>
Because the default is no longer <option>fsync_writethrough</option>,
data loss is possible during a power failure if the disk drive has
write caching enabled. To turn off the write cache on Windows,
from the <application>Device Manager</application>, choose the drive properties,
then <literal>Policies</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>New cache management algorithm <acronym>2Q</acronym> replaces
<acronym>ARC</acronym> (Tom)</para>
<para>
This was done to avoid a pending US patent on <acronym>ARC</acronym>.  The
<acronym>2Q</acronym> code might be a few percentage points slower than
<acronym>ARC</acronym> for some work loads.  A better cache management algorithm
will appear in 8.1.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Planner adjustments to improve behavior on freshly-created
tables (Tom)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Allow plpgsql to assign to an element of an array that is
initially <literal>NULL</literal> (Tom)</para>
<para>
Formerly the array would remain <literal>NULL</literal>, but now it becomes a
single-element array.  The main SQL engine was changed to handle
<command>UPDATE</command> of a null array value this way in 8.0, but the similar
case in plpgsql was overlooked.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Convert <literal>\r\n</literal> and <literal>\r</literal> to <literal>\n</literal>
in plpython function bodies (Michael Fuhr)</para>
<para>
 This prevents syntax errors when plpython code is written on a Windows or
 Mac client.

such as <command>EXPLAIN</command> (Tom)</para></listitem>

<literal>unregister</literal> options of <application>pg_ctl</application> (Magnus)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Ensure operations done during backend shutdown are counted by
statistics collector</para>
<para>
This is expected to resolve reports of <application>pg_autovacuum</application>
not vacuuming the system catalogs often enough &mdash; it was not being
told about catalog deletions caused by temporary table removal during
backend exit.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Change the Windows default for configuration parameter
<varname>log_destination</varname> to <option>eventlog</option> (Magnus)</para>
<para>
By default, a server running on Windows will now send log output to the
Windows event logger rather than standard error.

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>
      Microsoft Windows Native Server
     </term>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This is the first <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> release
       to run natively on <trademark class="registered">Microsoft Windows</trademark> as
       a server. It can run as a <productname>Windows</productname> service. This
       release supports NT-based Windows releases like
       <productname>Windows 2000 SP4</productname>, <productname>Windows XP</productname>, and
       <productname>Windows 2003</productname>. Older releases like
       <productname>Windows 95</productname>, <productname>Windows 98</productname>, and
       <productname>Windows ME</productname> are not supported because these operating
       systems do not have the infrastructure to support
       <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. A separate installer
       project has been created to ease installation on
       <productname>Windows</productname> &mdash; see <ulink
       url="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/win32/"></ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
       Although tested throughout our release cycle, the Windows port
       does not have the benefit of years of use in production
       environments that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has on
       Unix platforms.  Therefore it should be treated with the same
       level of caution as you would a new product.
      </para>

      <para>
       Previous releases required the Unix emulation toolkit
       <productname>Cygwin</productname> in order to run the server on Windows
       operating systems.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
       supported native clients on Windows for many years.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>
      Savepoints
     </term>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Savepoints allow specific parts of a transaction to be aborted
       without affecting the remainder of the transaction. Prior
       releases had no such capability; there was no way to recover
       from a statement failure within a transaction except by
       aborting the whole transaction. This feature is valuable for
       application writers who require error recovery within a
       complex transaction.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>
      Point-In-Time Recovery
     </term>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       In previous releases there was no way to recover from disk
       drive failure except to restore from a previous backup or use
       a standby replication server.  Point-in-time recovery allows
       continuous backup of the server.  You can recover either to
       the point of failure or to some transaction in the past.

     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>
      Tablespaces
     </term>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Tablespaces allow administrators to select different file systems
       for storage of individual tables, indexes, and databases.
       This improves performance and control over disk space
       usage. Prior releases used <application>initlocation</application> and
       manual symlink management for such tasks.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>
      Improved Buffer Management, <command>CHECKPOINT</command>,
      <command>VACUUM</command>
     </term>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This release has a more intelligent buffer replacement strategy,
       which will make better use of available shared buffers and
       improve performance. The performance impact of vacuum and
       checkpoints is also lessened.

       A new version of the <application>plperl</application> server-side language now
       supports a persistent shared storage area, triggers, returning records
       and arrays of records, and SPI calls to access the database.

   <title>Migration to Version 8.0</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore using <application>pg_dump</application> is
    required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.
   </para>

   <para>
    Observe the following incompatibilities:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      In <option>READ COMMITTED</option> serialization mode, volatile functions
      now see the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
      beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to the
      beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Functions declared <option>STABLE</option> or <option>IMMUTABLE</option> always
      use the snapshot of the calling query, and therefore do not see the
      effects of actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in
      their own transaction or other transactions.  Such a function must be
      read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other than
      <command>SELECT</command>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Nondeferred <option>AFTER</option> triggers are now fired immediately
      after completion of the triggering query, rather than upon
      finishing the current interactive command. This makes a
      difference when the triggering query occurred within a function:
      the trigger is invoked before the function proceeds to its next
      operation.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameters <varname>virtual_host</varname> and
      <varname>tcpip_socket</varname> have been replaced with a more general
      parameter <varname>listen_addresses</varname>. Also, the server now listens on
      <literal>localhost</literal> by default, which eliminates the need for the
      <literal>-i</literal> postmaster switch in many scenarios.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameters <varname>SortMem</varname> and
      <varname>VacuumMem</varname> have been renamed to <varname>work_mem</varname>
      and <varname>maintenance_work_mem</varname> to better reflect their
      use. The original names are still supported in
      <command>SET</command> and <command>SHOW</command>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameters <varname>log_pid</varname>,
      <varname>log_timestamp</varname>, and <varname>log_source_port</varname> have been
      replaced with a more general parameter <varname>log_line_prefix</varname>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameter <varname>syslog</varname> has been
      replaced with a more logical <varname>log_destination</varname> variable to
      control the log output destination.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameter <varname>log_statement</varname> has been
      changed so it can selectively log just database modification or
      data definition statements.  Server configuration parameter
      <varname>log_duration</varname> now prints only when <varname>log_statement</varname>
      prints the query.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Server configuration parameter <varname>max_expr_depth</varname> parameter has
      been replaced with <varname>max_stack_depth</varname> which measures the
      physical stack size rather than the expression nesting depth. This
      helps prevent session termination due to stack overflow caused by
      recursive functions.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The <function>length()</function> function no longer counts trailing spaces in
      <type>CHAR(n)</type> values.
     </para>
    </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Casting an integer to <type>BIT(N)</type> selects the rightmost N bits of the
     integer, not the leftmost N bits as before.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Updating an element or slice of a NULL array value now produces
     a nonnull array result, namely an array containing
     just the assigned-to positions.
    </para>
   </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Syntax checking of array input values has been tightened up
      considerably. Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with
      odd results now causes an error. Empty-string element values
      must now be written as <literal>""</literal>, rather than writing nothing.
      Also changed behavior with respect to whitespace surrounding
      array elements: trailing whitespace is now ignored, for symmetry
      with leading whitespace (which has always been ignored).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected and
      reported as an error.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte
      <type>"char"</type> data type have been removed.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The <function>extract()</function> function (also called
      <function>date_part</function>) now returns the proper year for BC dates.
      It previously returned one less than the correct year. The
      function now also returns the proper values for millennium and
      century.
     </para>
    </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <type>CIDR</type> values now must have their nonmasked bits be zero.
     For example, we no longer allow
     <literal>204.248.199.1/31</literal> as a <type>CIDR</type> value. Such
     values should never have been accepted by
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and will now be rejected.
    </para>
   </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>EXECUTE</command> now returns a completion tag that
      matches the executed statement.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      <application>psql</application>'s <command>\copy</command> command now reads or
      writes to the query's <literal>stdin/stdout</literal>, rather than
      <application>psql</application>'s <literal>stdin/stdout</literal>. The previous
      behavior can be accessed via new
      <option>pstdin</option>/<option>pstdout</option> parameters.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
     The JDBC client interface has been removed from the core
     distribution, and is now hosted at <ulink url=
     "http://jdbc.postgresql.org"></ulink>.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
     The Tcl client interface has also been removed. There are several

     "http://gborg.postgresql.org"></ulink>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The server now uses its own time zone database, rather than the
      one supplied by the operating system. This will provide consistent
      behavior across all platforms.  In most cases, there should be
      little noticeable difference in time zone behavior, except that
      the time zone names used by <command>SET</command>/<command>SHOW</command>
      <varname>TimeZone</varname> might be different from what your platform provides.

  <title>Deprecated Features</title>

  <para>
    Some aspects of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s behavior
    have been determined to be suboptimal. For the sake of backward
    compatibility these have not been removed in 8.0, but they are
    considered deprecated and will be removed in the next major
    release.
    </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The 8.1 release will remove the <function>to_char()</function> function
      for intervals.
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The server now warns of empty strings passed to
       <type>oid</type>/<type>float4</type>/<type>float8</type> data
       types, but continues to interpret them as zeroes as before.
       In the next major release, empty strings will be considered
       invalid input for these data types.
      </para>
     </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>

      configuration parameter must be set. Users are encouraged to

       Support cross-data-type index usage (Tom)
      </para>
      <para>
       Before this change, many queries would not use an index if the data
       types did not match exactly. This improvement makes index usage more
       intuitive and consistent.

      <para>
       New buffer replacement strategy that improves caching (Jan)
      </para>
      <para>
       Prior releases used a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to keep
       recently referenced pages in memory. The LRU algorithm
       did not consider the number of times a specific cache entry was
       accessed, so large table scans could force out useful cache pages.
       The new cache algorithm uses four separate lists to track most
       recently used and most frequently used cache pages and dynamically
       optimize their replacement based on the work load. This should
       lead to much more efficient use of the shared buffer cache.
       Administrators who have tested shared buffer sizes in the past
       should retest with this new cache replacement policy.

      <para>
       Add subprocess to write dirty buffers periodically to reduce
       checkpoint writes (Jan)
      </para>
      <para>
       In previous releases, the checkpoint process, which runs every few
       minutes, would write all dirty buffers to the operating system's
       buffer cache then flush all dirty operating system buffers to
       disk. This resulted in a periodic spike in disk usage that often
       hurt performance. The new code uses a background writer to trickle
       disk writes at a steady pace so checkpoints have far fewer dirty
       pages to write to disk. Also, the new code does not issue a global
       <function>sync()</function> call, but instead <function>fsync()</function>s just
       the files written since the last checkpoint. This should improve
       performance and minimize degradation during checkpoints.

       Add ability to prolong vacuum to reduce performance impact (Jan)
      </para>
      <para>
       On busy systems, <command>VACUUM</command> performs many I/O
       requests which can hurt performance for other users. This
       release allows you to slow down <command>VACUUM</command> to
       reduce its impact on other users, though this increases the
       total duration of <command>VACUUM</command>.

       Improve B-tree index performance for duplicate keys (Dmitry Tkach, Tom)

      <para>
       Use dynamically-generated table size estimates while planning (Tom)
      </para>
      <para>
       Formerly the planner estimated table sizes using the values seen
       by the last <command>VACUUM</command> or <command>ANALYZE</command>,
       both as to physical table size (number of pages) and number of rows.
       Now, the current physical table size is obtained from the kernel,
       and the number of rows is estimated by multiplying the table size
       by the row density (rows per page) seen by the last
       <command>VACUUM</command> or <command>ANALYZE</command>.  This should
       produce more reliable estimates in cases where the table size has
       changed significantly since the last housekeeping command.

       Improved index usage with <literal>OR</literal> clauses (Tom)
      </para>
      <para>
       This allows the optimizer to use indexes in statements with many OR
       clauses that would not have been indexed in the past.  It can also use
       multi-column indexes where the first column is specified and the second

       <command>ANALYZE</command> now collects statistics for

      <para>
       Expression indexes (also called functional indexes) allow users to
       index not just columns but the results of expressions and function
       calls. With this release, the optimizer can gather and use statistics
       about the contents of expression indexes.  This will greatly improve
       the quality of planning for queries in which an expression index is
       relevant.

       Plan prepared queries only when first executed so constants can be

      </para>
      <para>
       Prepared statements plan queries once and execute them many
       times. While prepared queries avoid the overhead of re-planning
       on each use, the quality of the plan suffers from not knowing the exact
       parameters to be used in the query.  In this release, planning of
       unnamed prepared statements is delayed until the first execution,
       and the actual parameter values of that execution are used as
       optimization hints.  This allows use of out-of-line parameter passing
       without incurring a performance penalty.

       Implement dollar quoting to simplify single-quote usage (Andrew, Tom,
       David Fetter)
      </para>
      <para>
       In previous releases, because single quotes had to be used to
       quote a function's body, the use of single quotes inside the
       function text required use of two single quotes or other error-prone
       notations. With this release we add the ability to use "dollar
       quoting" to quote a block of text.  The ability to use different
       quoting delimiters at different nesting levels greatly simplifies
       the task of quoting correctly, especially in complex functions.
       Dollar quoting can be used anywhere quoted text is needed.

       In 7.3 and 7.4, a long-running B-tree index build could block concurrent

      <para>
       This reduces the potential for deadlocks against other backends
       that want exclusive locks on tables.  To get the benefit of this
       change, do not execute database-wide <command>ANALYZE</command>

       In <literal>READ COMMITTED</literal> serialization mode, volatile functions

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Functions declared <literal>STABLE</literal> or <literal>IMMUTABLE</literal> always
       use the snapshot of the calling query, and therefore do not see the
       effects of actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in
       their own transaction or other transactions.  Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other than
       <command>SELECT</command>.  There is a considerable performance gain from
       declaring a function <literal>STABLE</literal> or <literal>IMMUTABLE</literal>

       Nondeferred <option>AFTER</option> triggers are now fired immediately

       when the triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger
       is invoked before the function proceeds to its next operation. For
       example, if a function inserts a new row into a table, any
       nondeferred foreign key checks occur before proceeding with the

       In PL/Tcl, SPI commands are now run in subtransactions.  If an error
