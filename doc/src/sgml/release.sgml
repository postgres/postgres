Typical markup:

\-\-?[A-Za-z_]+[-A-Za-z_]*      <option> (use backslashes to avoid SGML markup)
\<[A-Za-z_]+/[A-Za-z_]+\>       <filename>

        We cannot use UTF8 because back branches still use SGML Docbook,
        which does not support it.  Also, rendering engines have to
        support the referenced characters.

        Do not use numeric _UTF_ numeric character escapes (&#nnn;),
        we can only use Latin1.

        Example: Alvaro Herrera is &Aacute;lvaro Herrera
        Find non-ASCII characters (remove 'X'):
             grep -X-color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]"

<appendix id="release">
 <title>Release Notes</title>

  <para>
   The release notes contain the significant changes in each
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> release, with major features and migration
   issues listed at the top.  The release notes do not contain changes
   that affect only a few users or changes that are internal and therefore not
   user-visible.  For example, the optimizer is improved in almost every
   release, but the improvements are usually observed by users as simply
   faster queries.
  </para>

  <para>
   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
   viewing the <link linkend="git">Git</link> logs for each release.
   The <ulink
   url="https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-committers/"><literal>pgsql-committers</literal>
   email list</ulink> records all source code changes as well.  There is also
   a <ulink url="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=summary">web
   interface</ulink> that shows changes to specific files.
  </para>

  <para>
   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item.  Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.
  </para>

<!--
  When beginning a new major-release series, create a new release-NN.sgml
  file, removing the previous one, and change the &-reference here.
  Don't forget to update filelist.sgml.

  The reason for keeping each branch's release notes in a differently-named
  file is to reduce confusion when preparing minor-release updates.
  All the active branches have to be edited concurrently when doing that.
