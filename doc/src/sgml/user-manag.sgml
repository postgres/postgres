 <title>Database User and Permission Management</title>

 <para>
  Managing database users and their privileges is in concept similar
  to that of Unix operating systems, but then again not identical
  enough to not warrant explanation.
 </para>

 <sect1>
  <title>Database Users</title>

  <para>
   Database users are conceptually completely separate from any
   operating system users. In practice it might be convenient to
   maintain a correspondence, but this is not required. Database user
   names are global across a database cluster installation (and not
   per individual database). To create a user use the <command>CREATE
   USER</command> SQL command:
<synopsis>
CREATE USER <replaceable>name</replaceable>
</synopsis>
   <replaceable>name</replaceable> follows the rules for SQL
   identifiers: either unadorned without special characters, or
   double-quoted. To remove an existing user, use the analog
   <command>DROP USER</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   For convenience, the shell scripts <filename>createuser</filename>
   and <filename>dropuser</filename> are wrappers around these SQL
   commands.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to bootstrap the database system, a freshly initialized
   system always contains one predefined user. This user will have
   the same name as the operating system user that initialized the
   area (and is presumably being used as the user that runs the
   server). Thus, often an initial user <quote>postgres</quote>
   exists. In order to create more users you have to first connect as
   this initial user.
  </para>

  <para>
   The user name to use for a particular database connection is
   indicated by the client that is initiating the connection request
   in an application-specific fashion. For example, the
   <command>psql</command> program uses the <option>-U</option>
   command line option to indicate the user to connect as. The set of
   database users a given client connection may connect as is
   determined by the client authentication setup, as explained in
   <xref linkend="client-authentication">. (Thus, a client is not
   necessarily limited to connect as the user with the same name as
   its operating system user in the same way a person is not
   constrained in its login name by her real name.)
  </para>

  <sect2 id="user-attributes">
   <title>User attributes</title>

   <para>
    A database user may have a number of attributes that define its
    privileges and interact with the client authentication system.

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>superuser</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A database superuser bypasses all permission checks. Also,
        only a superuser can create new users. To create a database
        superuser, use <literal>CREATE USER name
        CREATEUSER</literal>.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>database creation</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A user must be explicitly given permission to create databases
        (except for superusers, since those bypass all permission
        checks). To create such a user, use <literal>CREATE USER name
        CREATEDB</literal>.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>password</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A password is only significant if password authentication is
        used for client authentication. Database passwords a separate
        from any operating system passwords. Specify a password upon
        user creating as in <literal>CREATE USER name WITH PASSWORD
        'string'</literal>.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    See the reference pages for <command>CREATE USER</command> and
    <command>ALTER USER</command> for details.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Groups</title>

  <para>
   As in Unix, groups are a way of logically grouping users. To create
   a group, use
<synopsis>
CREATE GROUP <replaceable>name</replaceable>
</synopsis>
   To add users to or remove users from a group, respectively, user
<synopsis>
ALTER GROUP <replaceable>name</replaceable> ADD USER <replaceable>uname1</replaceable>, ...
ALTER GROUP <replaceable>name</replaceable> DROP USER <replaceable>uname1</replaceable>, ...
</synopsis>
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Privileges</title>

  <para>
   When a database object is created, it is assigned an owner. The
   owner is the user that executed the creation statement. There is
   currenty no polished interface for changing the owner of a database
   object. By default, only an owner (or a superuser) can do anything
   with the object. In order to allow other users to use it,
   <firstterm>privileges</firstterm> must be granted.
  </para>

  <para>
   Currently, there are four different privileges: select (read),
   insert (append), and update/delete (write), as well as
   <literal>RULE</literal>, the permission to create a rewrite rule on
   a table. The right to modify or destroy an object is always the
   privilege of the owner only. To assign privileges, the
   <command>GRANT</command> command is used. So, if
   <literal>joe</literal> is an existing user, and
   <literal>accounts</literal> is an existing table, write access can
   be granted with
<programlisting>
GRANT UPDATE ON accounts TO joe;
</programlisting>
   The user executing this command must be the owner of the table. To
   grant a privilege to a group, use
<programlisting>
GRANT SELECT ON accounts TO GROUP staff;
</programlisting>
   The special <quote>user</quote> name <literal>PUBLIC</literal> can
   be used to grant a privilege to every user on the system. Using
   <literal>ALL</literal> in place of a privilege specifies that all
   privileges will be granted.
  </para>

  <para>
   To revoke a privilege, use the fittingly named
   <command>REVOKE</command> command:
<programlisting>
REVOKE ALL ON accounts FROM PUBLIC;
</programlisting>
   The set of privileges held by the table owner is always implicit
   and is never revokable.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Functions and Triggers</title>

  <para>
   Functions and triggers allow users to insert code into the backend
   server that other users may execute without knowing it. Hence, both
   mechanisms permit users to <firstterm>trojan horse</firstterm>
   others with relative impunity. The only real protection is tight
   control over who can define functions (e.g., write to relations
   with SQL fields) and triggers. Audit trails and alerters on the
   system catalogs <literal>pg_class</literal>,
   <literal>pg_user</literal> and <literal>pg_group</literal> are also
   possible.
  </para>

  <para>
   Functions written in any language except SQL run inside the backend
   server process with the operating systems permissions of the
   database server daemon process. It is possible to change the
   server's internal data structures from inside of trusted functions.
   Hence, among many other things, such functions can circumvent any
   system access controls. This is an inherent problem with
   user-defined C functions.
