 <para>
  The <filename>pg_visibility</> module provides a means for examining the
  visibility map (VM) and page-level visibility information.
 </para>

 <para>
  These routines return information about three different bits.  The
  all-visible bit in the visibility map indicates that every tuple on
  a given page of a relation is visible to every current transaction.  The
  all-frozen bit in the visibility map indicates that every tuple on the
  page is frozen; that is, no future vacuum will need to modify the page
  until such time as a tuple is inserted, updated, deleted, or locked on
  that page.  The page-level <literal>PD_ALL_VISIBLE</literal> bit has the
  same meaning as the all-visible bit in the visibility map, but is stored
  within the data page itself rather than a separate data structure.  These
  will normally agree, but the page-level bit can sometimes be set while the
  visibility map bit is clear after a crash recovery; or they can disagree
  because of a change which occurs after <literal>pg_visibility</> examines
  the visibility map and before it examines the data page.
 </para>

 <para>
  Functions which display information about <literal>PG_ALL_VISIBLE</>
  are much more costly than those which only consult the visibility map,
  because they must read the relation's data blocks rather than only the
  (much smaller) visibility map.
