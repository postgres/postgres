# Reference point for ABI compliance checks
#
# This file lists commits on the current branch that break ABI compatibility in
# ways that have been deemed acceptable (e.g., removing an extern function with
# no third-party uses).  The primary intent of this file is to control the ABI
# compliance checks on the buildfarm, but it also serves as a central location
# to document the justification for each.
#
# In general, entries should be added reactively after an abi-compliance-check
# buildfarm failure.  It is important to verify the details of the breakage
# match expectations, as the first entry listed will become the updated ABI
# baseline point.
#
# Add new entries by adding the output of the following to the top of the file:
#
# $ git log --pretty=format:"%H%n#%n# %s%n# %cd%n#%n# <ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" $ABIBREAKGITHASH -1 --date=iso
#
# Be sure to replace "<ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" with details of your change and
# why it is deemed acceptable.

# Reject ADD CONSTRAINT NOT NULL if name mismatches existing constraint
# 2026-02-03 12:33:29 +0100
#
# This commit added the constraint name as a parameter to
# AdjustNotNullInheritance(), which it needed to verify that the new name
# matches the existing one.  PGXN contained no calls to that function.

# Fix trigger transition table capture for MERGE in CTE queries.
# 2026-01-24 11:30:48 +0000
#
# This commit changed the TransitionCaptureState structure, replacing
# the "tcs_private" field with 3 separate fields. This structure can
# only be built using MakeTransitionCaptureState(), and PGXN contained
# no calls to MakeTransitionCaptureState() or uses of the
# TransitionCaptureState structure.

# Revisit cosmetics of "For inplace update, send nontransactional invalidations."

#
# This removed a CacheInvalidateHeapTupleInplace() parameter.  PGXN contained
# no calls to that function.

# Check for CREATE privilege on the schema in CREATE STATISTICS.
# 2025-11-10 09:00:00 -0600
#
# This commit added a parameter to CreateStatistics().  We are unaware of any
# impacted third-party code.

# Fix lookups in pg_{clear,restore}_{attribute,relation}_stats().
# 2025-10-15 12:47:33 -0500
#
# This commit replaced two functions related to lookups/privilege checks for
# the new stats stuff in v18 with RangeVarGetRelidExtended().  These functions
# were not intended for use elsewhere, exist in exactly one release (18.0), and
# do not have any known third-party callers.
