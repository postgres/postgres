    This chapter describes the settings available in the

    file. They apply only for the duration of the
    recovery.  They must be reset for any subsequent recovery you wish to
    perform.  They cannot be changed once recovery has begun.

   <para>
     Settings in <filename>recovery.conf</> are specified in the format
     <literal>name = 'value'</>. One parameter is specified per line.
     Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) designate the rest of the
     line as a comment.  To embed a single quote in a parameter
     value, write two quotes (<literal>''</>).

        The local shell command to execute to retrieve an archived segment of
        the WAL file series. This parameter is required for archive recovery,
        but optional for streaming replication.
        Any <literal>%f</> in the string is
        replaced by the name of the file to retrieve from the archive,
        and any <literal>%p</> is replaced by the copy destination path name
        on the server.
        (The path name is relative to the current working directory,
        i.e., the cluster's data directory.)
        Any <literal>%r</> is replaced by the name of the file containing the
        last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that must be kept
        to allow a restore to be restartable, so this information can be used
        to truncate the archive to just the minimum required to support
        restarting from the current restore. <literal>%r</> is typically only
        used by warm-standby configurations
        (see <xref linkend="warm-standby">).
        Write <literal>%%</> to embed an actual <literal>%</> character.
       </para>

       <para>
        It is important for the command to return a zero exit status
        only if it succeeds.  The command <emphasis>will</> be asked for file
        names that are not present in the archive; it must return nonzero
        when so asked.  Examples:
<programlisting>
restore_command = 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f "%p"'
restore_command = 'copy "C:\\server\\archivedir\\%f" "%p"'  # Windows
</programlisting>
        An exception is that if the command was terminated by a signal (other
        than <systemitem>SIGTERM</systemitem>, which is used as part of a
        database server shutdown) or an error by the shell (such as command
        not found), then recovery will abort and the server will not start up.

       <para>
        This optional parameter specifies a shell command that will be executed
        at every restartpoint.  The purpose of
        <varname>archive_cleanup_command</> is to provide a mechanism for
        cleaning up old archived WAL files that are no longer needed by the
        standby server.
        Any <literal>%r</> is replaced by the name of the file containing the
        last valid restart point.
        That is the earliest file that must be <emphasis>kept</> to allow a
        restore to be restartable, and so all files earlier than <literal>%r</>
        may be safely removed.
        This information can be used to truncate the archive to just the
        minimum required to support restart from the current restore.
        The <xref linkend="pgarchivecleanup"> module
        is often used in <varname>archive_cleanup_command</> for
        single-standby configurations, for example:
<programlisting>archive_cleanup_command = 'pg_archivecleanup /mnt/server/archivedir %r'</programlisting>
        Note however that if multiple standby servers are restoring from the
        same archive directory, you will need to ensure that you do not delete
        WAL files until they are no longer needed by any of the servers.
        <varname>archive_cleanup_command</> would typically be used in a
        warm-standby configuration (see <xref linkend="warm-standby">).

       <para>
        Specifies what action the server should take once the recovery target is
        reached. The default is <literal>pause</>, which means recovery will
        be paused. <literal>promote</> means the recovery process will finish
        and the server will start to accept connections.
        Finally <literal>shutdown</> will stop the server after reaching the
        recovery target.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intended use of the <literal>pause</> setting is to allow queries
        to be executed against the database to check if this recovery target
        is the most desirable point for recovery.
        The paused state can be resumed by
        using <function>pg_xlog_replay_resume()</> (see
        <xref linkend="functions-recovery-control-table">), which then
        causes recovery to end. If this recovery target is not the
        desired stopping point, then shut down the server, change the
        recovery target settings to a later target and restart to
        continue recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        The <literal>shutdown</> setting is useful to have the instance ready
        at the exact replay point desired.  The instance will still be able to
        replay more WAL records (and in fact will have to replay WAL records
        since the last checkpoint next time it is started).

        any subsequent start will end with immediate shutdown unless the
        configuration is changed or the <filename>recovery.conf</> file is
        removed manually.

       <para>
        This setting has no effect if no recovery target is set.

       <para>
        By default, a standby server restores WAL records from the
        primary as soon as possible. It may be useful to have a time-delayed
        copy of the data, offering opportunities to correct data loss errors.
        This parameter allows you to delay recovery by a fixed period of time,
        measured in milliseconds if no unit is specified.  For example, if
        you set this parameter to <literal>5min</literal>, the standby will
        replay each transaction commit only when the system time on the standby
        is at least five minutes past the commit time reported by the master.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is possible that the replication delay between servers exceeds the
        value of this parameter, in which case no delay is added.
        Note that the delay is calculated between the WAL time stamp as written
        on master and the current time on the standby. Delays in transfer
        because of network lag or cascading replication configurations
        may reduce the actual wait time significantly. If the system
        clocks on master and standby are not synchronized, this may lead to
        recovery applying records earlier than expected; but that is not a
        major issue because useful settings of this parameter are much larger
        than typical time deviations between servers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delay occurs only on WAL records for transaction commits.
        Other records are replayed as quickly as possible, which
        is not a problem because MVCC visibility rules ensure their effects
        are not visible until the corresponding commit record is applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delay occurs once the database in recovery has reached a consistent
        state, until the standby is promoted or triggered. After that the standby
        will end recovery without further waiting.
       </para>
       <para>
        This parameter is intended for use with streaming replication deployments;
        however, if the parameter is specified it will be honored in all cases.
        Synchronous replication is not affected by this setting because there is
        not yet any setting to request synchronous apply of transaction commits.
        <varname>hot_standby_feedback</> will be delayed by use of this feature
        which could lead to bloat on the master; use both together with care.
