  <para>
   It does not matter which order the opposite corners of a cube are
   entered in.  The <type>cube</> functions
   automatically swap values if needed to create a uniform
   <quote>lower left &mdash; upper right</> internal representation.
  </para>

  <para>
   White space is ignored, so <literal>[(<replaceable>x</>),(<replaceable>y</>)]</literal> is the same as
   <literal>[ ( <replaceable>x</> ), ( <replaceable>y</> ) ]</literal>.

  <title>Precision</title>

  <para>
   Values are stored internally as 64-bit floating point numbers. This means
   that numbers with more than about 16 significant digits will be truncated.

  <title>Usage</title>

  <para>
   The <filename>cube</> module includes a GiST index operator class for
   <type>cube</> values.
   The operators supported by the GiST operator class are shown in <xref linkend="cube-gist-operators">.
  </para>

  <table id="cube-gist-operators">
   <title>Cube GiST Operators</title>
   <tgroup cols="2">
    <thead>
     <row>
      <entry>Operator</entry>
      <entry>Description</entry>
     </row>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
     <row>
      <entry><literal>a = b</></entry>

      <entry>The cube a is contained in the cube b.</entry>
     </row>
    </tbody>
   </tgroup>
  </table>

  <para>
   (Before PostgreSQL 8.2, the containment operators <literal>@&gt;</> and <literal>&lt;@</> were
   respectively called <literal>@</> and <literal>~</>.  These names are still available, but are
   deprecated and will eventually be retired.  Notice that the old names
   are reversed from the convention formerly followed by the core geometric
   data types!)
  </para>

  <para>
   The standard B-tree operators are also provided, for example

   <informaltable>
    <tgroup cols="2">
     <thead>
      <row>
       <entry>Operator</entry>
       <entry>Description</entry>
      </row>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
      <row>
       <entry><literal>[a, b] &lt; [c, d]</literal></entry>
       <entry>Less than</entry>
      </row>

      <row>
       <entry><literal>[a, b] &gt; [c, d]</literal></entry>
       <entry>Greater than</entry>
      </row>
     </tbody>
    </tgroup>
   </informaltable>

   These operators do not make a lot of sense for any practical
   purpose but sorting. These operators first compare (a) to (c),
   and if these are equal, compare (b) to (d). That results in
   reasonably good sorting in most cases, which is useful if
   you want to use ORDER BY with this type.

      <entry>Increases the size of a cube by a specified radius in at least
       n dimensions. If the radius is negative the cube is shrunk instead. This
       is useful for creating bounding boxes around a point for searching for
       nearby points. All defined dimensions are changed by the radius r.
       LL coordinates are decreased by r and UR coordinates are increased by r.
       If a LL coordinate is increased to larger than the corresponding UR
       coordinate (this can only happen when r &lt; 0) than both coordinates
       are set to their average.  If n is greater than the number of defined
       dimensions and the cube is being increased (r &gt;= 0) then 0 is used
       as the base for the extra coordinates.

    In all binary operations on differently-dimensioned cubes, I assume the
    lower-dimensional one to be a Cartesian projection, i. e., having zeroes
    in place of coordinates omitted in the string representation. The above
    examples are equivalent to:
   </para>

<programlisting>
cube_union('(0,5,2),(2,3,1)','(0,0,0),(0,0,0)');
cube_inter('(0,-1),(1,1)','(-2,0),(2,0)');
</programlisting>

   <para>
    The following containment predicate uses the point syntax,
    while in fact the second argument is internally represented by a box.
    This syntax makes it unnecessary to define a separate point type
    and functions for (box,point) predicates.

   My thanks are primarily to Prof. Joe Hellerstein
   (<ulink url="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/"></ulink>) for elucidating the
   gist of the GiST (<ulink url="http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu/"></ulink>), and
   to his former student Andy Dong for his example written for Illustra.
   I am also grateful to all Postgres developers, present and past, for
   enabling myself to create my own world and live undisturbed in it. And I
   would like to acknowledge my gratitude to Argonne Lab and to the
   U.S. Department of Energy for the years of faithful support of my database
   research.
