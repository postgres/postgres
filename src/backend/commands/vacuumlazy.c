 *
 * vacuumlazy.c
 *	  Concurrent ("lazy") vacuuming.
 *
 *
 * The major space usage for LAZY VACUUM is storage for the array of dead
 * tuple TIDs, with the next biggest need being storage for per-disk-page
 * free space info.  We want to ensure we can vacuum even the very largest
 * relations with finite memory space usage.  To do that, we set upper bounds
 * on the number of tuples and pages we will keep track of at once.
 *
 * We are willing to use at most maintenance_work_mem (or perhaps
 * autovacuum_work_mem) memory space to keep track of dead tuples.  We
 * initially allocate an array of TIDs of that size, with an upper limit that
 * depends on table size (this limit ensures we don't allocate a huge area
 * uselessly for vacuuming small tables).  If the array threatens to overflow,
 * we suspend the heap scan phase and perform a pass of index cleanup and page
 * compaction, then resume the heap scan with an empty TID array.
 *
 * If we're processing a table with no indexes, we can just vacuum each page
 * as we go; there's no need to save up multiple tuples to minimize the number
 * of index scans performed.  So we don't use maintenance_work_mem memory for
 * the TID array, just enough to hold as many heap tuples as fit on one page.

	 * if we can skip a goodly number of pages.
	 *
	 * When aggressive is set, we can't skip pages just because they are
	 * all-visible, but we can still skip pages that are all-frozen, since
	 * such pages do not need freezing and do not affect the value that we can
	 * safely set for relfrozenxid or relminmxid.
	 *
	 * Before entering the main loop, establish the invariant that
	 * next_unskippable_block is the next block number >= blkno that's not we
	 * can't skip based on the visibility map, either all-visible for a
	 * regular scan or all-frozen for an aggressive scan.  We set it to
	 * nblocks if there's no such block.  We also set up the skipping_blocks
	 * flag correctly at this stage.
	 *
	 * Note: The value returned by visibilitymap_get_status could be slightly
	 * out-of-date, since we make this test before reading the corresponding
	 * heap page or locking the buffer.  This is OK.  If we mistakenly think
	 * that the page is all-visible or all-frozen when in fact the flag's just
	 * been cleared, we might fail to vacuum the page.  It's easy to see that
	 * skipping a page when aggressive is not set is not a very big deal; we
	 * might leave some dead tuples lying around, but the next vacuum will
	 * find them.  But even when aggressive *is* set, it's still OK if we miss
	 * a page whose all-frozen marking has just been cleared.  Any new XIDs
	 * just added to that page are necessarily newer than the GlobalXmin we
	 * computed, so they'll have no effect on the value to which we can safely
	 * set relfrozenxid.  A similar argument applies for MXIDs and relminmxid.
	 *
	 * We will scan the table's last page, at least to the extent of
	 * determining whether it has tuples or not, even if it should be skipped
	 * according to the above rules; except when we've already determined that
	 * it's not worth trying to truncate the table.  This avoids having
	 * lazy_truncate_heap() take access-exclusive lock on the table to attempt
	 * a truncation that just fails immediately because there are tuples in
	 * the last page.  This is worth avoiding mainly because such a lock must
