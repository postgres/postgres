   <title>What's In This Book</title>

   <para>
    This book describes the use of the SQL language in PostgreSQL.  We
    start with describing the general syntax of SQL, then explain how
    to create the structures to hold data, how to populate the
    database, and how to query it.  The middle part lists the
    available data types and functions for use in SQL data commands.
    The rest of the book treats several aspects that are important for
    tuning a database for optimal performance.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information in this book is arranged so that a novice user can
    follow it start to end to gain a full understanding of the topics
    without having to refer forward too many times.  The chapters are
    intended to be self-contained, so that advanced users can read the
    chapters individually as they choose.  The information in this
    book is presented in a narrative fashion in topical units.
    Readers looking for a complete description of a particular command
    should look into the &cite-reference;.
   </para>

   <para>
    Readers of this book should know how to connect to a PostgreSQL
    database and issue SQL commands.  Readers that are unfamiliar with
    these issues are encouraged to read the &cite-tutorial; first.  SQL
    commands are typically entered using the PostgreSQL interactive
    terminal <application>psql</application>, but other programs that
    have similar functionality can be used as well.
