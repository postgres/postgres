      Fix failure to reset <application>libpq</application>'s state fully
      between connection attempts (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      An unprivileged user of <filename>dblink</filename>
      or <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> could bypass the checks intended
      to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as
      a <filename>~/.pgpass</filename> file owned by the operating-system
      user running the server.  Servers allowing peer authentication on
      local connections are particularly vulnerable.  Other attacks such
      as SQL injection into a <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> session
      are also possible.
      Attacking <filename>postgres_fdw</filename> in this way requires the
      ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection
      parameters, but any user with access to <filename>dblink</filename>
      could exploit the problem.
      In general, an attacker with the ability to select the connection
      parameters for a <application>libpq</application>-using application
      could cause mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are
      harder to think of.
      Our thanks to Andrew Krasichkov for reporting this issue.

      Fix <literal>INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE</literal> through a view

      (Dean Rasheed, Amit Langote)
     </para>

     <para>
      Erroneous expansion of an updatable view could lead to crashes
      or <quote>attribute ... has the wrong type</quote> errors, if the
      view's <literal>SELECT</literal> list doesn't match one-to-one with
      the underlying table's columns.
      Furthermore, this bug could be leveraged to allow updates of columns
      that an attacking user lacks <literal>UPDATE</literal> privilege for,
      if that user has <literal>INSERT</literal> and <literal>UPDATE</literal>
      privileges for some other column(s) of the table.
      Any user could also use it for disclosure of server memory.

     <para>
      Overoptimistic caching rules could prevent these updates from being
      seen by other sessions, leading to spurious errors and/or data
      corruption.  The problem was significantly worse for shared catalogs,
      such as <structname>pg_authid</structname>, because the stale cache

      Remove public execute privilege

      <function>pg_logfile_rotate()</function> function (Stephen Frost)
     </para>

     <para>
      <function>pg_logfile_rotate()</function> is a deprecated wrapper
      for the core function <function>pg_rotate_logfile()</function>.
      When that function was changed to rely on SQL privileges for access
      control rather than a hard-coded superuser
      check, <function>pg_logfile_rotate()</function> should have been
      updated as well, but the need for this was missed.  Hence,
      if <filename>adminpack</filename> is installed, any user could
      request a logfile rotation, creating a minor security issue.

      Fix incorrect volatility markings on a few built-in functions

      <function>query_to_xml</function>,
      <function>cursor_to_xml</function>,
      <function>cursor_to_xmlschema</function>,
      <function>query_to_xmlschema</function>, and
      <function>query_to_xml_and_xmlschema</function>
      should be marked volatile because they execute user-supplied queries
      that might contain volatile operations.  They were not, leading to a
      risk of incorrect query optimization.  This has been repaired for new
      installations by correcting the initial catalog data, but existing
      installations will continue to contain the incorrect markings.
      Practical use of these functions seems to pose little hazard, but in
      case of trouble, it can be fixed by manually updating these
      functions' <structname>pg_proc</structname> entries, for example
      <literal>ALTER FUNCTION pg_catalog.query_to_xml(text, boolean,
      boolean, text) VOLATILE</literal>.  (Note that that will need to be

      Fix incorrect parallel-safety markings on a few built-in functions

      <function>ts_stat</function>, and
      <function>binary_upgrade_create_empty_extension</function>
      should be marked parallel-unsafe; some because they perform database
      modifications directly, and others because they execute user-supplied
      queries that might do so.  They were marked parallel-restricted
      instead, leading to a risk of unexpected query errors.  This has been
      repaired for new installations by correcting the initial catalog
      data, but existing installations will continue to contain the
      incorrect markings.  Practical use of these functions seems to pose
      little hazard unless <varname>force_parallel_mode</varname> is turned
      on.  In case of trouble, it can be fixed by manually updating these
      functions' <structname>pg_proc</structname> entries, for example
      <literal>ALTER FUNCTION pg_catalog.brin_summarize_new_values(regclass)

      Avoid re-using TOAST value OIDs that match dead-but-not-yet-vacuumed

     <para>
      Once the OID counter has wrapped around, it's possible to assign a
      TOAST value whose OID matches a previously deleted entry in the same

      Change <command>ANALYZE</command>'s algorithm for updating
      <structname>pg_class</structname>.<structfield>reltuples</structfield>
      (David Gould)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, pages not actually scanned by <command>ANALYZE</command>
      were assumed to retain their old tuple density.  In a large table
      where <command>ANALYZE</command> samples only a small fraction of the
      pages, this meant that the overall tuple density estimate could not
      change very much, so that <structfield>reltuples</structfield> would
      change nearly proportionally to changes in the table's physical size
      (<structfield>relpages</structfield>) regardless of what was actually
      happening in the table.  This has been observed to result
      in <structfield>reltuples</structfield> becoming so much larger than
      reality as to effectively shut off autovacuuming.  To fix, assume
      that <command>ANALYZE</command>'s sample is a statistically unbiased
      sample of the table (as it should be), and just extrapolate the
      density observed within those pages to the whole table.

      Document how to configure installations and applications to guard
      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Using a <varname>search_path</varname> setting that includes any
      schemas writable by a hostile user enables that user to capture
      control of queries and then run arbitrary SQL code with the
      permissions of the attacked user.  While it is possible to write
      queries that are proof against such hijacking, it is notationally
      tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.  Therefore, we now
      recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas appear in
      one's search path.  Relevant documentation appears in
      <xref linkend="ddl-schemas-patterns"/> (for database administrators and users),

      themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the previous

      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them

      modify them to include only the <structname>pg_catalog</structname>

      Fix logical decoding to correctly clean up disk files for crashed

     <para>
      Logical decoding may spill WAL records to disk for transactions
      generating many WAL records.  Normally these files are cleaned up
      after the transaction's commit or abort record arrives; but if
      no such record is ever seen, the removal code misbehaved.

      In databases using UTF8 encoding, ignore any XML declaration that

     <para>
      We always store XML strings in the database encoding, so allowing
      libxml to act on a declaration of another encoding gave wrong results.
      In encodings other than UTF8, we don't promise to support non-ASCII

      Provide for forward compatibility with future minor protocol versions
      (Robert Haas, Badrul Chowdhury)
     </para>

     <para>
      Up to now, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers simply
      rejected requests to use protocol versions newer than 3.0, so that
      there was no functional difference between the major and minor parts
      of the protocol version number.  Allow clients to request versions 3.x
      without failing, sending back a message showing that the server only
      understands 3.0.  This makes no difference at the moment, but
      back-patching this change should allow speedier introduction of future
      minor protocol upgrades.

      Avoid unsafe alignment assumptions when working

     <para>
      Typically, compilers assume that <type>__int128</type> variables are
      aligned on 16-byte boundaries, but our memory allocation
      infrastructure isn't prepared to guarantee that, and increasing the
      setting of MAXALIGN seems infeasible for multiple reasons.  Adjust the
      code to allow use of <type>__int128</type> only when we can tell the
      compiler to assume lesser alignment.  The only known symptom of this
      problem so far is crashes in some parallel aggregation queries.

     <para>
      These functions are stated to
      be <trademark class="registered">Oracle</trademark> compatible, but
      they weren't exactly.  In particular, there was a discrepancy in the
      interpretation of a negative third parameter: Oracle thinks that a
      negative value indicates the last place where the target substring can
      begin, whereas our functions took it as the last place where the
      target can end.  Also, Oracle throws an error for a zero or negative
      fourth parameter, whereas our functions returned zero.

      Fix <application>pg_dump</application> to make ACL (permissions),

      output formats (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The <quote>tag</quote> portion of an ACL archive entry was usually
      just the name of the associated object.  Make it start with the object
      type instead, bringing ACLs into line with the convention already used
      for comment and security label archive entries.  Also, fix the
      comment and security label entries for the whole database, if present,
      to make their tags start with <literal>DATABASE</literal> so that they
      also follow this convention.  This prevents false matches in code that
      tries to identify large-object-related entries by seeing if the tag
      starts with <literal>LARGE OBJECT</literal>.  That could have resulted
      in misclassifying entries as data rather than schema, with undesirable
      results in a schema-only or data-only dump.

     <para>
      Previously, the postmaster log file was opened while still running as

      be removed or renamed out of the way before restarting the server with

     <para>
      Certain <command>ALTER</command> commands that change the definition of a
      composite type or domain type are supposed to fail if there are any
      stored values of that type in the database, because they lack the
      infrastructure needed to update or check such values.  Previously,
      these checks could miss relevant values that are wrapped inside range
      types or sub-domains, possibly allowing the database to become
      inconsistent.

      Improve selection of compiler flags for PL/Perl on Windows (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      This fix avoids possible crashes of PL/Perl due to inconsistent
      assumptions about the width of <type>time_t</type> values.
      A side-effect that may be visible to extension developers is
      that <literal>_USE_32BIT_TIME_T</literal> is no longer defined globally
      in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> Windows builds.  This is not expected
      to cause problems, because type <type>time_t</type> is not used

      Further restrict visibility

      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <literal>USAGE</literal> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</structname> does not
      show the options in such cases, <structname>pg_user_mappings</structname>
      should not either.

        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</literal>

        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.
        In <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.5 and later, you can use
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</literal>, undo that with

ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

      Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libpq</application> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <application>psql</application> or other <application>libpq</application>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<application>libpq</application>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <literal>md5</literal>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

     <para>
      If several sessions concurrently lock a tuple update chain with
      nonconflicting lock modes using an old snapshot, and they all
      succeed, it was possible for some of them to nonetheless fail (and
      conclude there is no live tuple version) due to a race condition.
      This had consequences such as foreign-key checks failing to see a
      tuple that definitely exists but is being updated concurrently.

      Allow a foreign table's <literal>CHECK</literal> constraints to be
      initially <literal>NOT VALID</literal> (Amit Langote)
     </para>

     <para>
      <command>CREATE TABLE</command> silently drops <literal>NOT VALID</literal>
      specifiers for <literal>CHECK</literal> constraints, reasoning that the
      table must be empty so the constraint can be validated immediately.
      But this is wrong for <command>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</command>, where there's
      no reason to suppose that the underlying table is empty, and even if
      it is it's no business of ours to decide that the constraint can be
      treated as valid going forward.  Skip this <quote>optimization</quote> for
      foreign tables.

      Prevent exposure of statistical information via leaky operators
      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <structname>pg_statistic</structname>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      Fix possibly-invalid initial snapshot during logical decoding
      (Petr Jelinek, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The initial snapshot created for a logical decoding replication slot
      was potentially incorrect.  This could cause third-party tools that
      use logical decoding to copy incomplete/inconsistent initial data.
      This was more likely to happen if the source server was busy at the
      time of slot creation, or if another logical slot already existed.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you are using a replication tool that depends on logical decoding,
      and it should have copied a nonempty data set at the start of
      replication, it is advisable to recreate the replica after
      installing this update, or to verify its contents against the source
      server.

      satisfying a query's request for more than one worker process, or when
      multiple queries requested workers simultaneously.  On most platforms
      this required unlucky timing, but on some it was the typical case.

      Update time zone data files to <application>tzdata</application> release 2017b
      for DST law changes in Chile, Haiti, and Mongolia, plus historical
      corrections for Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Liberia, and Spain.

      America, the Pacific and Indian oceans, and some Asian and Middle
      Eastern countries.

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <structname>pg_timezone_names</structname>
      view nor used for output.

      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names
      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </para>

     <para>
      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <filename>posixrules</filename> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <literal>US/Eastern</literal> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <filename>posixrules</filename> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <xref linkend="datatype-timezones"/>).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
      to take effect.

      Fix a race condition that could cause indexes built
      with <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> to be corrupt
      (Pavan Deolasee, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> was used to build an index
      that depends on a column not previously indexed, then rows
      updated by transactions that ran concurrently with
      the <command>CREATE INDEX</command> command could have received incorrect
      index entries.  If you suspect this may have happened, the most
      reliable solution is to rebuild affected indexes after installing
      this update.

      Fix implementation of phrase search operators in <type>tsquery</type>

     <para>
      Remove incorrect, and inconsistently-applied, rewrite rules that
      tried to transform away AND/OR/NOT operators appearing below a PHRASE
      operator; instead upgrade the execution engine to handle such cases
      correctly.  This fixes assorted strange behavior and possible crashes
      for text search queries containing such combinations.  Also fix
      nested PHRASE operators to work sanely in combinations other than
      simple left-deep trees, correct the behavior when removing stopwords
      from a phrase search clause, and make sure that index searches behave
      consistently with simple sequential-scan application of such queries.

      Fix WAL-logging of truncation of relation free space maps and
      visibility maps (Pavan Deolasee, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      It was possible for these files to not be correctly restored during
      crash recovery, or to be written incorrectly on a standby server.
      Bogus entries in a free space map could lead to attempts to access
      pages that have been truncated away from the relation itself, typically
      producing errors like <quote>could not read block <replaceable>XXX</replaceable>:
      read only 0 of 8192 bytes</quote>.  Checksum failures in the
      visibility map are also possible, if checksumming is enabled.

     <para>
      Fix possible data corruption when <application>pg_upgrade</application> rewrites
      a relation visibility map into 9.6 format (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      On big-endian machines, bytes of the new visibility map were written
      in the wrong order, leading to a completely incorrect map.  On
      Windows, the old map was read using text mode, leading to incorrect
      results if the map happened to contain consecutive bytes that matched
      a carriage return/line feed sequence.  The latter error would almost
      always lead to a <application>pg_upgrade</application> failure due to the map
      file appearing to be the wrong length.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you are using a big-endian machine (many non-Intel architectures
      are big-endian) and have used <application>pg_upgrade</application> to upgrade
      from a pre-9.6 release, you should assume that all visibility maps are
      incorrect and need to be regenerated.  It is sufficient to truncate
      each relation's visibility map
      with <filename>contrib/pg_visibility</filename>'s
      <function>pg_truncate_visibility_map()</function> function.

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations

      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <structname>pg_timezone_names</structname>

       <para>
        With 9.6, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> introduces initial support
        for parallel execution of large queries.  Only strictly read-only
        queries where the driving table is accessed via a sequential scan
        can be parallelized.  Hash joins and nested loops can be performed
        in parallel, as can aggregation (for supported aggregates).
        Much remains to be done, but this is already a useful set of
        features.

       </para>

       <para>
        Formerly, anti-wraparound vacuum had to visit every page of
        a table, even pages where there was nothing to do.  Now, pages
        containing only already-frozen tuples are identified in the table's
        visibility map, and can be skipped by vacuum even when doing
        transaction wraparound prevention.  This should greatly reduce the
        cost of maintaining large tables containing mostly-unchanging data.
       </para>

       <para>
        If necessary, vacuum can be forced to process all-frozen
        pages using the new <literal>DISABLE_PAGE_SKIPPING</literal> option.
        Normally this should never be needed, but it might help in
        recovering from visibility-map corruption.

        Allow old <acronym>MVCC</acronym> snapshots to be invalidated after a

       </para>

       <para>
        Normally, deleted tuples cannot be physically removed by
        vacuuming until the last transaction that could <quote>see</quote>
        them is gone.  A transaction that stays open for a long
        time can thus cause considerable table bloat because
        space cannot be recycled.  This feature allows setting
        a time-based limit, via the new configuration parameter
        <xref linkend="guc-old-snapshot-threshold"/>, on how long an
        <acronym>MVCC</acronym> snapshot is guaranteed to be valid.  After that,
        dead tuples are candidates for removal.  A transaction using an
        outdated snapshot will get an error if it attempts to read a page
        that potentially could have contained such data.

        Where feasible, trigger kernel writeback after a configurable

       </para>

       <para>
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> writes data to the kernel's disk cache,
        from where it will be flushed to physical storage in due time.
        Many operating systems are not smart about managing this and allow
        large amounts of dirty data to accumulate before deciding to flush
        it all at once, causing long delays for new I/O requests until the
        flushing finishes.
        This change attempts to alleviate this problem by explicitly
        requesting data flushes after a configurable interval.

        Force backends to exit if the postmaster dies (Rajeev Rastogi,
        Robert Haas)
       </para>

       <para>
        Under normal circumstances the postmaster should always outlive
        its child processes.  If for some reason the postmaster dies,
        force backend sessions to exit with an error.  Formerly, existing
        backends would continue to run until their clients disconnect,
        but that is unsafe and inefficient.  It also prevents a new
        postmaster from being started until the last old backend has
        exited.  Backends will detect postmaster death when waiting for
        client I/O, so the exit will not be instantaneous, but it should
        happen no later than the end of the current query.

       <para>
        Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
        constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
       </para>

       <para>
        When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
        that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
        as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
        a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
        happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
        This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
        serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
        the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
        in the transaction.

        Formerly, many security-sensitive functions contained hard-wired
