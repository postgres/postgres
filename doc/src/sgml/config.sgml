  <para>
   There are many configuration parameters that affect the behavior of
   the database system. In the first section of this chapter we
   describe how to interact with configuration parameters. The subsequent sections
   discuss each parameter in detail.

    <title>Parameter Names and Values</title>

    <para>
     All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
     value of one of five types: boolean, string, integer, floating point,
     or enumerated (enum).  The type determines the syntax for setting the
     parameter:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Boolean:</emphasis>
       Values can be written as
       <literal>on</literal>,
       <literal>off</literal>,
       <literal>true</literal>,
       <literal>false</literal>,
       <literal>yes</literal>,
       <literal>no</literal>,

       (all case-insensitive) or any unambiguous prefix of one of these.

     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>String:</emphasis>
       In general, enclose the value in single quotes, doubling any single
       quotes within the value.  Quotes can usually be omitted if the value
       is a simple number or identifier, however.
       (Values that match an SQL keyword require quoting in some contexts.)
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Numeric (integer and floating point):</emphasis>
       Numeric parameters can be specified in the customary integer and
       floating-point formats; fractional values are rounded to the nearest
       integer if the parameter is of integer type.  Integer parameters
       additionally accept hexadecimal input (beginning
       with <literal>0x</literal>) and octal input (beginning
       with <literal>0</literal>), but these formats cannot have a fraction.
       Do not use thousands separators.
       Quotes are not required, except for hexadecimal input.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Numeric with Unit:</emphasis>
       Some numeric parameters have an implicit unit, because they describe
       quantities of memory or time. The unit might be bytes, kilobytes, blocks
       (typically eight kilobytes), milliseconds, seconds, or minutes.
       An unadorned numeric value for one of these settings will use the
       setting's default unit, which can be learned from
       <structname>pg_settings</structname>.<structfield>unit</structfield>.
       For convenience, settings can be given with a unit specified explicitly,
       for example <literal>'120 ms'</literal> for a time value, and they will be
       converted to whatever the parameter's actual unit is.  Note that the
       value must be written as a string (with quotes) to use this feature.
       The unit name is case-sensitive, and there can be whitespace between
       the numeric value and the unit.

       <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
         <para>
          Valid memory units are <literal>B</literal> (bytes),
          <literal>kB</literal> (kilobytes),
          <literal>MB</literal> (megabytes), <literal>GB</literal>
          (gigabytes), and <literal>TB</literal> (terabytes).
          The multiplier for memory units is 1024, not 1000.
         </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
         <para>
          Valid time units are
          <literal>us</literal> (microseconds),
          <literal>ms</literal> (milliseconds),
          <literal>s</literal> (seconds), <literal>min</literal> (minutes),
          <literal>h</literal> (hours), and <literal>d</literal> (days).
         </para>
        </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>

       If a fractional value is specified with a unit, it will be rounded
       to a multiple of the next smaller unit if there is one.
       For example, <literal>30.1 GB</literal> will be converted
       to <literal>30822 MB</literal> not <literal>32319628902 B</literal>.
       If the parameter is of integer type, a final rounding to integer
       occurs after any unit conversion.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Enumerated:</emphasis>
       Enumerated-type parameters are written in the same way as string
       parameters, but are restricted to have one of a limited set of
       values.  The values allowable for such a parameter can be found from
       <structname>pg_settings</structname>.<structfield>enumvals</structfield>.
       Enum parameter values are case-insensitive.

   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="config-setting-configuration-file">
    <title>Parameter Interaction via the Configuration File</title>

    <para>
     The most fundamental way to set these parameters is to edit the file
     <filename>postgresql.conf</filename><indexterm><primary>postgresql.conf</primary></indexterm>,
     which is normally kept in the data directory.  A default copy is
     installed when the database cluster directory is initialized.
     An example of what this file might look like is:
<programlisting>
# This is a comment
log_connections = yes
log_destination = 'syslog'
search_path = '"$user", public'
shared_buffers = 128MB
</programlisting>
     One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
     value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant (except within a quoted
     parameter value) and blank lines are
     ignored. Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) designate the remainder
     of the line as a comment.  Parameter values that are not simple
     identifiers or numbers must be single-quoted.  To embed a single
     quote in a parameter value, write either two quotes (preferred)
     or backslash-quote.
     If the file contains multiple entries for the same parameter,
     all but the last one are ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
     Parameters set in this way provide default values for the cluster.
     The settings seen by active sessions will be these values unless they
     are overridden.  The following sections describe ways in which the
     administrator or user can override these defaults.
    </para>

    <para>
     <indexterm>
      <primary>SIGHUP</primary>
     </indexterm>
     The configuration file is reread whenever the main server process
     receives a <systemitem>SIGHUP</systemitem> signal; this signal is most easily
     sent by running <literal>pg_ctl reload</literal> from the command line or by
     calling the SQL function <function>pg_reload_conf()</function>. The main
     server process also propagates this signal to all currently running
     server processes, so that existing sessions also adopt the new values
     (this will happen after they complete any currently-executing client
     command).  Alternatively, you can
     send the signal to a single server process directly.  Some parameters
     can only be set at server start; any changes to their entries in the
     configuration file will be ignored until the server is restarted.
     Invalid parameter settings in the configuration file are likewise
     ignored (but logged) during <systemitem>SIGHUP</systemitem> processing.
    </para>

    <para>
     In addition to <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>,
     a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> data directory contains a file
     <filename>postgresql.auto.conf</filename><indexterm><primary>postgresql.auto.conf</primary></indexterm>,
     which has the same format as <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> but
     is intended to be edited automatically, not manually.  This file holds
     settings provided through the <link linkend="sql-altersystem"><command>ALTER SYSTEM</command></link> command.
     This file is read whenever <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> is,
     and its settings take effect in the same way.  Settings
     in <filename>postgresql.auto.conf</filename> override those
     in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
     External tools may also
     modify <filename>postgresql.auto.conf</filename>.  It is not
     recommended to do this while the server is running unless <xref
     linkend="guc-allow-alter-system"/> is set to <literal>off</literal>, since a
     concurrent <command>ALTER SYSTEM</command> command could overwrite
     such changes.  Such tools might simply append new settings to the end,
     or they might choose to remove duplicate settings and/or comments
     (as <command>ALTER SYSTEM</command> will).
    </para>

    <para>
     The system view
     <link linkend="view-pg-file-settings"><structname>pg_file_settings</structname></link>
     can be helpful for pre-testing changes to the configuration files, or for
     diagnosing problems if a <systemitem>SIGHUP</systemitem> signal did not have the
     desired effects.

   <sect2 id="config-setting-sql">
    <title>Parameter Interaction via SQL</title>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides three SQL
      commands to establish configuration defaults.
      The already-mentioned <command>ALTER SYSTEM</command> command
      provides an SQL-accessible means of changing global defaults; it is
      functionally equivalent to editing <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.
      In addition, there are two commands that allow setting of defaults
      on a per-database or per-role basis:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <link linkend="sql-alterdatabase"><command>ALTER DATABASE</command></link> command allows global
       settings to be overridden on a per-database basis.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <link linkend="sql-alterrole"><command>ALTER ROLE</command></link> command allows both global and
       per-database settings to be overridden with user-specific values.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

     <para>
      Values set with <command>ALTER DATABASE</command> and <command>ALTER ROLE</command>
      are applied only when starting a fresh database session.  They
      override values obtained from the configuration files or server
      command line, and constitute defaults for the rest of the session.
      Note that some settings cannot be changed after server start, and
      so cannot be set with these commands (or the ones listed below).
    </para>

     <para>
      Once a client is connected to the database, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      provides two additional SQL commands (and equivalent functions) to
      interact with session-local configuration settings:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      The <link linkend="sql-show"><command>SHOW</command></link> command allows inspection of the
      current value of any parameter.  The corresponding SQL function is
      <function>current_setting(setting_name text)</function>
      (see <xref linkend="functions-admin-set"/>).
     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <link linkend="sql-set"><command>SET</command></link> command allows modification of the
       current value of those parameters that can be set locally to a
       session; it has no effect on other sessions.
       Many parameters can be set this way by any user, but some can
       only be set by superusers and users who have been
       granted <literal>SET</literal> privilege on that parameter.
       The corresponding SQL function is
       <function>set_config(setting_name, new_value, is_local)</function>
       (see <xref linkend="functions-admin-set"/>).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
     In addition, the system view <link
     linkend="view-pg-settings"><structname>pg_settings</structname></link> can be
     used to view and change session-local values:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Querying this view is similar to using <command>SHOW ALL</command> but
       provides more detail.  It is also more flexible, since it's possible
       to specify filter conditions or join against other relations.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Using <command>UPDATE</command> on this view, specifically
       updating the <structname>setting</structname> column, is the equivalent
       of issuing <command>SET</command> commands.  For example, the equivalent of
<programlisting>
SET configuration_parameter TO DEFAULT;
</programlisting>
       is:
<programlisting>
UPDATE pg_settings SET setting = reset_val WHERE name = 'configuration_parameter';

    <title>Parameter Interaction via the Shell</title>

     <para>
      In addition to setting global defaults or attaching
      overrides at the database or role level, you can pass settings to
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> via shell facilities.
      Both the server and <application>libpq</application> client library
      accept parameter values via the shell.

       During server startup, parameter settings can be
       passed to the <command>postgres</command> command via the
       <option>-c name=value</option> command-line parameter, or its equivalent
       <option>--name=value</option> variation.  For example,
<programlisting>
postgres -c log_connections=yes --log-destination='syslog'
</programlisting>
       Settings provided in this way override those set via
       <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> or <command>ALTER SYSTEM</command>,
       so they cannot be changed globally without restarting the server.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      When starting a client session via <application>libpq</application>,
      parameter settings can be
      specified using the <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> environment variable.
      Settings established in this way constitute defaults for the life
      of the session, but do not affect other sessions.
      For historical reasons, the format of <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> is
      similar to that used when launching the <command>postgres</command>
      command; specifically, the <option>-c</option>, or prepended
      <literal>--</literal>, before the name must be specified. For example,
<programlisting>
env PGOPTIONS="-c geqo=off --statement-timeout=5min" psql
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      Other clients and libraries might provide their own mechanisms,

   <sect2 id="config-includes">
    <title>Managing Configuration File Contents</title>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides several features for breaking
      down complex <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> files into sub-files.
      These features are especially useful when managing multiple servers
      with related, but not identical, configurations.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include</literal></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      In addition to individual parameter settings,
      the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file can contain <firstterm>include
      directives</firstterm>, which specify another file to read and process as if
      it were inserted into the configuration file at this point.  This
      feature allows a configuration file to be divided into physically
      separate parts.  Include directives simply look like:
<programlisting>
include 'filename'
</programlisting>
      If the file name is not an absolute path, it is taken as relative to
      the directory containing the referencing configuration file.
      Inclusions can be nested.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include_if_exists</literal></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      There is also an <literal>include_if_exists</literal> directive, which acts
      the same as the <literal>include</literal> directive, except
      when the referenced file does not exist or cannot be read.  A regular
      <literal>include</literal> will consider this an error condition, but
      <literal>include_if_exists</literal> merely logs a message and continues
      processing the referencing configuration file.
     </para>

     <para>
      <indexterm>
       <primary><literal>include_dir</literal></primary>
       <secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      The <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file can also contain
      <literal>include_dir</literal> directives, which specify an entire
      directory of configuration files to include.  These look like
<programlisting>
include_dir 'directory'
</programlisting>
      Non-absolute directory names are taken as relative to the directory
      containing the referencing configuration file.  Within the specified
      directory, only non-directory files whose names end with the
      suffix <literal>.conf</literal> will be included.  File names that
      start with the <literal>.</literal> character are also ignored, to
      prevent mistakes since such files are hidden on some platforms.  Multiple
      files within an include directory are processed in file name order
      (according to C locale rules, i.e., numbers before letters, and
      uppercase letters before lowercase ones).
     </para>

     <para>
      Include files or directories can be used to logically separate portions
      of the database configuration, rather than having a single large
      <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file.  Consider a company that has two
      database servers, each with a different amount of memory.  There are
      likely elements of the configuration both will share, for things such
      as logging.  But memory-related parameters on the server will vary
      between the two.  And there might be server specific customizations,
      too.  One way to manage this situation is to break the custom
      configuration changes for your site into three files.  You could add
      this to the end of your <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file to include
      them:
<programlisting>
include 'shared.conf'
include 'memory.conf'
include 'server.conf'
</programlisting>
      All systems would have the same <filename>shared.conf</filename>.  Each
      server with a particular amount of memory could share the
      same <filename>memory.conf</filename>; you might have one for all servers
      with 8GB of RAM, another for those having 16GB.  And
      finally <filename>server.conf</filename> could have truly server-specific
      configuration information in it.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another possibility is to create a configuration file directory and
      put this information into files there. For example, a <filename>conf.d</filename>
      directory could be referenced at the end of <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>:
<programlisting>
include_dir 'conf.d'
</programlisting>
      Then you could name the files in the <filename>conf.d</filename> directory
      like this:
<programlisting>
00shared.conf
01memory.conf
02server.conf
</programlisting>
       This naming convention establishes a clear order in which these
       files will be loaded.  This is important because only the last
       setting encountered for a particular parameter while the server is
       reading configuration files will be used.  In this example,
       something set in <filename>conf.d/02server.conf</filename> would override a
       value set in <filename>conf.d/01memory.conf</filename>.
     </para>

     <para>
      You might instead use this approach to naming the files
      descriptively:
<programlisting>
00shared.conf
01memory-8GB.conf
02server-foo.conf
</programlisting>
      This sort of arrangement gives a unique name for each configuration file
      variation.  This can help eliminate ambiguity when several servers have
      their configurations all stored in one place, such as in a version
      control repository.  (Storing database configuration files under version
      control is another good practice to consider.)

     <para>
      In addition to the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file
      already mentioned, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses
      two other manually-edited configuration files, which control
      client authentication (their use is discussed in <xref
      linkend="client-authentication"/>).  By default, all three
      configuration files are stored in the database cluster's data
      directory.  The parameters described in this section allow the
      configuration files to be placed elsewhere.  (Doing so can ease
      administration.  In particular it is often easier to ensure that
      the configuration files are properly backed-up when they are
      kept separate.)

      In a default installation, none of the above parameters are set

      data directory is specified by the <option>-D</option> command-line
      option or the <envar>PGDATA</envar> environment variable, and the
      configuration files are all found within the data directory.

        Specifies the directory of the Unix-domain socket(s) on which the
        server is to listen for connections from client applications.
        Multiple sockets can be created by listing multiple directories
        separated by commas.  Whitespace between entries is
        ignored; surround a directory name with double quotes if you need
        to include whitespace or commas in the name.
        An empty value
        specifies not listening on any Unix-domain sockets, in which case
        only TCP/IP sockets can be used to connect to the server.

       <para>
        A value that starts with <literal>@</literal> specifies that a
        Unix-domain socket in the abstract namespace should be created
        (currently supported on Linux only).  In that case, this value
        does not specify a <quote>directory</quote> but a prefix from which
        the actual socket name is computed in the same manner as for the
        file-system namespace.  While the abstract socket name prefix can be
        chosen freely, since it is not a file-system location, the convention
        is to nonetheless use file-system-like values such as
        <literal>@/tmp</literal>.

        The default value is normally

        Huge pages are known as large pages on Windows.  To use them, you need to
        assign the user right <quote>Lock pages in memory</quote> to the Windows user account
        that runs <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
        You can use Windows Group Policy tool (gpedit.msc) to assign the user right
        <quote>Lock pages in memory</quote>.
        To start the database server on the command prompt as a standalone process,
        not as a Windows service, the command prompt must be run as an administrator or
        User Access Control (UAC) must be disabled. When the UAC is enabled, the normal
        command prompt revokes the user right <quote>Lock pages in memory</quote> when started.

        Note that this setting only affects the main shared memory area.
        Operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Illumos can also use

        Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation
        (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes.
        The default value is four megabytes (<literal>4MB</literal>).
        Note that a complex query might perform several sort and hash
        operations at the same time, with each operation generally being
        allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before
        it starts
        to write data into temporary files.  Also, several running
        sessions could be doing such operations concurrently.
        Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value
        of <varname>work_mem</varname>; it is necessary to keep this
        fact in mind when choosing the value.  Sort operations are used
        for <literal>ORDER BY</literal>, <literal>DISTINCT</literal>,
        and merge joins.
        Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, memoize
        nodes and hash-based processing of <literal>IN</literal> subqueries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory
        availability than equivalent sort-based operations.  The
        memory limit for a hash table is computed by multiplying
        <varname>work_mem</varname> by
        <varname>hash_mem_multiplier</varname>.  This makes it
        possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory
        that exceeds the usual <varname>work_mem</varname> base
        amount.

        pressure typically takes the form of intermittent out of
        memory errors).  The default setting of 2.0 is often effective with
        mixed workloads.  Higher settings in the range of 2.0 - 8.0 or
        more may be effective in environments where

        enforced by the kernel (as set by <literal>ulimit -s</literal> or local
        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety

        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes.
        The default setting is two megabytes (<literal>2MB</literal>), which

        Setting <varname>max_stack_depth</varname> higher than

        the server will not allow this variable to be set to an unsafe
        value.  However, not all platforms provide the information,

      clean buffers and have to write dirty buffers themselves.
      However, the background writer does cause a net overall

      otherwise be written only once per checkpoint interval, the

         In each round, no more than this many buffers will be written
         by the background writer.  Setting this to zero disables
         background writing.  (Note that checkpoints, which are managed by
         a separate, dedicated auxiliary process, are unaffected.)
         The default value is 100 buffers.

         The number of dirty buffers written in each round is based on the
         number of new buffers that have been needed by server processes
         during recent rounds.  The average recent need is multiplied by
         <varname>bgwriter_lru_multiplier</varname> to arrive at an estimate of the
         number of buffers that will be needed during the next round.  Dirty
         buffers are written until there are that many clean, reusable buffers
         available.  (However, no more than <varname>bgwriter_lru_maxpages</varname>
         buffers will be written per round.)
         Thus, a setting of 1.0 represents a <quote>just in time</quote> policy
         of writing exactly the number of buffers predicted to be needed.
         Larger values provide some cushion against spikes in demand,
         while smaller values intentionally leave writes to be done by
         server processes.
         The default is 2.0.
         This parameter can only be set in the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>

         Whenever more than this amount of data has

        </para>

        <para>
         Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more
         resources than non-parallel queries, because each worker process is
         a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the
         system as an additional user session.  This should be taken into
         account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when
         configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such
         as <xref linkend="guc-work-mem"/>.  Resource limits such as
         <varname>work_mem</varname> are applied individually to each worker,
         which means the total utilization may be much higher across all
         processes than it would normally be for any single process.
         For example, a parallel query using 4 workers may use up to 5 times
         as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which
         uses no workers at all.

        <para>
         Note that parallel utility commands should not consume

         operations.  This strategy differs from that of parallel
         query, where resource limits generally apply per worker
         process.  Parallel utility commands treat the resource limit
         <varname>maintenance_work_mem</varname> as a limit to be applied to
         the entire utility command, regardless of the number of

       <para>
        The <literal>minimal</literal> level generates the least WAL
        volume.  It logs no row information for permanent relations
        in transactions that create or
        rewrite them.  This can make operations much faster (see

        the event of a power failure or system crash.  Thus it
        is only advisable to turn off <varname>fsync</varname> if
        you can easily recreate your entire database from external
        data.
       </para>

       <para>
        Examples of safe circumstances for turning off
        <varname>fsync</varname> include the initial loading of a new
        database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster
        for processing a batch of data after which the database
        will be thrown away and recreated,
        or for a read-only database clone which
        gets recreated frequently and is not used for failover.  High
        quality hardware alone is not a sufficient justification for
        turning off <varname>fsync</varname>.
       </para>

       <para>
        For reliable recovery when changing <varname>fsync</varname>
        off to on, it is necessary to force all modified buffers in the
        kernel to durable storage.  This can be done while the cluster
        is shutdown or while <varname>fsync</varname> is on by running <command>initdb
        --sync-only</command>, running <command>sync</command>, unmounting the
        file system, or rebooting the server.

        In many situations, turning off <xref linkend="guc-synchronous-commit"/>
        for noncritical transactions can provide much of the potential

        <literal>off</literal>;  <literal>remote_apply</literal>,
        <literal>remote_write</literal> and <literal>local</literal>
        all provide the same local synchronization level
        as <literal>on</literal>.  The local behavior of all
        non-<literal>off</literal> modes is to wait for local flush of WAL
        to disk.  In <literal>off</literal> mode, there is no waiting,
        so there can be a delay between when success is reported to the
        client and when the transaction is later guaranteed to be safe
        against a server crash.  (The maximum
        delay is three times <xref linkend="guc-wal-writer-delay"/>.)  Unlike
        <xref linkend="guc-fsync"/>, setting this parameter to <literal>off</literal>
        does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating
        system or database crash might
        result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but
        the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had
        been aborted cleanly.  So, turning <varname>synchronous_commit</varname> off
        can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than
        exact certainty about the durability of a transaction.  For more
        discussion see <xref linkend="wal-async-commit"/>.

       <para>
        If <xref linkend="guc-synchronous-standby-names"/> is non-empty,
        <varname>synchronous_commit</varname> also controls whether
        transaction commits will wait for their WAL records to be
        processed on the standby server(s).
       </para>

       <para>
        When set to <literal>remote_apply</literal>, commits will wait
        until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they
        have received the commit record of the transaction and applied
        it, so that it has become visible to queries on the standby(s),
        and also written to durable storage on the standbys.  This will
        cause much larger commit delays than previous settings since
        it waits for WAL replay.  When set to <literal>on</literal>,
        commits wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received
        the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to durable storage.  This
        ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and
        all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage.
        When set to <literal>remote_write</literal>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have
        received the commit record of the transaction and written it to
        their file systems. This setting ensures data preservation if a standby instance of
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> crashes, but not if the standby
        suffers an operating-system-level crash because the data has not
        necessarily reached durable storage on the standby.
        The setting <literal>local</literal> causes commits to wait for
        local flush to disk, but not for replication.  This is usually not
        desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for
        completeness.

       <para>
        This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any
        one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it
        commits.  It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some
        transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously.
        For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit
        asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue <command>SET
        LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF</command> within the transaction.

        When this parameter is on, the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server
        writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the
        first modification of that page after a checkpoint.
        This is needed because
        a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might
        be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page
        that contains a mix of old and new data.  The row-level change data
        normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore
        such a page during post-crash recovery.  Storing the full page image
        guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price
        of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.
        Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to
        increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)

       <para>
        Turning this parameter off speeds normal operation, but
        might lead to either unrecoverable data corruption, or silent
        data corruption, after a system failure. The risks are similar to turning off
        <varname>fsync</varname>, though smaller, and it should be turned off
        only based on the same circumstances recommended for that parameter.

        The contents of the WAL buffers are written out to disk at every

        provide a significant benefit.  However, setting this value to at
        least a few megabytes can improve write performance on a busy
        server where many clients are committing at once.  The auto-tuning
        selected by the default setting of -1 should give reasonable
        results in most cases.

        Setting <varname>commit_delay</varname> adds a time delay
        before a WAL flush is initiated.  This can improve
        group commit throughput by allowing a larger number of transactions
        to commit via a single WAL flush, if system load is high enough
        that additional transactions become ready to commit within the
        given interval.  However, it also increases latency by up to the
        <varname>commit_delay</varname> for each WAL
        flush.  Because the delay is just wasted if no other transactions
        become ready to commit, a delay is only performed if at least
        <varname>commit_siblings</varname> other transactions are active
        when a flush is about to be initiated.  Also, no delays are
        performed if <varname>fsync</varname> is disabled.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as microseconds.
        The default <varname>commit_delay</varname> is zero (no delay).

        Whenever more than this amount of data has been

        limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing
        the likelihood of stalls when an <function>fsync</function> is issued at the end of the
        checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the
        background.  Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction
        latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads

        The <xref linkend="guc-archive-command"/> or <xref linkend="guc-archive-library"/> is only invoked for
        completed WAL segments. Hence, if your server generates little WAL
        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived
        data can be, you can set <varname>archive_timeout</varname> to force the
        server to switch to a new WAL segment file periodically.  When this
        parameter is greater than zero, the server will switch to a new
        segment file whenever this amount of time has elapsed since the last
        segment file switch, and there has been any database activity,
        including a single checkpoint (checkpoints are skipped if there is
        no database activity).  Note that archived files that are closed
        early due to a forced switch are still the same length as completely
        full files.  Therefore, it is unwise to use a very short
        <varname>archive_timeout</varname> &mdash; it will bloat your archive
        storage.  <varname>archive_timeout</varname> settings of a minute or so are
        usually reasonable.  You should consider using streaming replication,
        instead of archiving, if you want data to be copied off the primary
        server more quickly than that.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds.

     in the data directory.  The server will enter recovery and will not stop
     recovery when the end of archived WAL is reached, but will keep trying to
     continue recovery by connecting to the sending server as specified by the
     <varname>primary_conninfo</varname> setting and/or by fetching new WAL
     segments using <varname>restore_command</varname>.  For this mode, the
     parameters from this section and <xref
     linkend="runtime-config-replication-standby"/> are of interest.
     Parameters from <xref linkend="runtime-config-wal-recovery-target"/> will
     also be applied but are typically not useful in this mode.

       this comfortably higher than the time that could pass between a backup
       and a later incremental backup that depends on it.  WAL summaries must
       be available for the entire range of WAL records between the preceding
       backup and the new one being taken; if not, the incremental backup will
       fail. If this parameter is set to zero, WAL summaries will not be

      These parameters can be set on any server that is
      to send replication data to one or more standby servers.
      The primary is always a sending server, so these parameters must
      always be set on the primary.
      The role and meaning of these parameters does not change after a
      standby becomes the primary.

        replication is disabled.  Abrupt disconnection of a streaming client might
        leave an orphaned connection slot behind until a timeout is reached,

        Slot invalidation due to idle timeout occurs during checkpoint.
        Because checkpoints happen at <varname>checkpoint_timeout</varname>

        <varname>idle_replication_slot_timeout</varname> was exceeded and when
        the slot invalidation is triggered at the next checkpoint.
        To avoid such lags, users can force a checkpoint to promptly invalidate
        inactive slots. The duration of slot inactivity is calculated using the
        slot's <link linkend="view-pg-replication-slots">pg_replication_slots</link>.<structfield>inactive_since</structfield>
        value.

        and <replaceable class="parameter">standby_name</replaceable>
        is the name of a standby server.
        <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable>

       </para>
       <para>
        The keyword <literal>FIRST</literal>, coupled with
        <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable>, specifies a
        priority-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits
        wait until their WAL records are replicated to
        <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable> synchronous
        standbys chosen based on their priorities. For example, a setting of

        <literal>s1</literal>, <literal>s2</literal>, <literal>s3</literal> and <literal>s4</literal>.
        The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher

        appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys.
        If any of the current synchronous standbys disconnects for whatever
        reason, it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority

        The keyword <literal>ANY</literal>, coupled with

        wait until their WAL records are replicated to <emphasis>at least</emphasis>
        <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable> listed standbys.
        For example, a setting of <literal>ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</literal> will cause
        each commit to proceed as soon as at least any three standbys of
        <literal>s1</literal>, <literal>s2</literal>, <literal>s3</literal> and <literal>s4</literal>
        reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        <literal>FIRST</literal> and <literal>ANY</literal> are case-insensitive. If these
        keywords are used as the name of a standby server,
        its <replaceable class="parameter">standby_name</replaceable> must
        be double-quoted.

       <para>
        The third syntax was used before <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
        version 9.6 and is still supported. It's the same as the first syntax
        with <literal>FIRST</literal> and
        <replaceable class="parameter">num_sync</replaceable> equal to 1.
        For example, <literal>FIRST 1 (s1, s2)</literal> and <literal>s1, s2</literal> have
        the same meaning: either <literal>s1</literal> or <literal>s2</literal> is chosen
        as a synchronous standby.

       <para>
        The special entry <literal>*</literal> matches any standby name.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no mechanism to enforce uniqueness of standby names.  In case
        of duplicates one of the matching standbys will be considered as
        higher priority, though exactly which one is indeterminate.

        This parameter is useful in configurations where a node in recovery

        make the recovery more responsive in the detection of a new WAL
        file by reducing the value of this parameter. On a system with
        low WAL activity, increasing it reduces the amount of requests necessary
        to access WAL archives, something useful for example in cloud

        By default, a standby server restores WAL records from the
        sending server as soon as possible. It may be useful to have a time-delayed
        copy of the data, offering opportunities to correct data loss errors.
        This parameter allows you to delay recovery by a specified amount
        of time.  For example, if
        you set this parameter to <literal>5min</literal>, the standby will
        replay each transaction commit only when the system time on the standby
        is at least five minutes past the commit time reported by the primary.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default is zero, adding no delay.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is possible that the replication delay between servers exceeds the
        value of this parameter, in which case no delay is added.
        Note that the delay is calculated between the WAL time stamp as written
        on primary and the current time on the standby. Delays in transfer
        because of network lag or cascading replication configurations
        may reduce the actual wait time significantly. If the system
        clocks on primary and standby are not synchronized, this may lead to
        recovery applying records earlier than expected; but that is not a
        major issue because useful settings of this parameter are much larger
        than typical time deviations between servers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delay occurs only on WAL records for transaction commits.
        Other records are replayed as quickly as possible, which
        is not a problem because MVCC visibility rules ensure their effects
        are not visible until the corresponding commit record is applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delay occurs once the database in recovery has reached a consistent
        state, until the standby is promoted or triggered. After that the standby
        will end recovery without further waiting.
       </para>
       <para>
        WAL records must be kept on the standby until they are ready to be
        applied. Therefore, longer delays will result in a greater accumulation
        of WAL files, increasing disk space requirements for the standby's
        <filename>pg_wal</filename> directory.
       </para>
       <para>
        This parameter is intended for use with streaming replication deployments;
        however, if the parameter is specified it will be honored in all cases
        except crash recovery.

        <varname>hot_standby_feedback</varname> will be delayed by use of this feature

       These configuration parameters provide a crude method of
       influencing the query plans chosen by the query optimizer. If
       the default plan chosen by the optimizer for a particular query
       is not optimal, a <emphasis>temporary</emphasis> solution is to use one
       of these configuration parameters to force the optimizer to
       choose a different plan.
       Better ways to improve the quality of the
       plans chosen by the optimizer include adjusting the planner cost
       constants (see <xref linkend="runtime-config-query-constants"/>),
       running <link linkend="sql-analyze"><command>ANALYZE</command></link> manually, increasing
       the value of the <xref

       and increasing the amount of statistics collected for
       specific columns using <command>ALTER TABLE SET

    <para>
     The <firstterm>cost</firstterm> variables described in this section are measured
     on an arbitrary scale.  Only their relative values matter, hence
     scaling them all up or down by the same factor will result in no change
     in the planner's choices.  By default, these cost variables are based on
     the cost of sequential page fetches; that is,
     <varname>seq_page_cost</varname> is conventionally set to <literal>1.0</literal>
     and the other cost variables are set with reference to that.  But
     you can use a different scale if you prefer, such as actual execution
     times in milliseconds on a particular machine.

   <note>
    <para>
     Unfortunately, there is no well-defined method for determining ideal
     values for the cost variables.  They are best treated as averages over
     the entire mix of queries that a particular installation will receive.  This
     means that changing them on the basis of just a few experiments is very

        make index scans look relatively more expensive.  You can raise
        or lower both values together to change the importance of disk I/O
        costs relative to CPU costs, which are described by the following
        parameters.
       </para>

       <para>
        Random access to mechanical disk storage is normally much more expensive
        than four times sequential access.  However, a lower default is used
        (4.0) because the majority of random accesses to disk, such as indexed
        reads, are assumed to be in cache.  The default value can be thought of
        as modeling random access as 40 times slower than sequential, while
        expecting 90% of random reads to be cached.
       </para>

       <para>
        If you believe a 90% cache rate is an incorrect assumption
        for your workload, you can increase random_page_cost to better
        reflect the true cost of random storage reads. Correspondingly,
        if your data is likely to be completely in cache, such as when
        the database is smaller than the total server memory, decreasing
        random_page_cost can be appropriate.  Storage that has a low random
        read cost relative to sequential, e.g., solid-state drives, might
        also be better modeled with a lower value for random_page_cost,
        e.g., <literal>1.1</literal>.
       </para>

       <tip>
        <para>
         Although the system will let you set <varname>random_page_cost</varname> to
         less than <varname>seq_page_cost</varname>, it is not physically sensible
         to do so.  However, setting them equal makes sense if the database
         is entirely cached in RAM, since in that case there is no penalty
         for touching pages out of sequence.  Also, in a heavily-cached
         database you should lower both values relative to the CPU parameters,
         since the cost of fetching a page already in RAM is much smaller
         than it would normally be.

       <para>
        When this parameter allows it for a particular table, the planner
        compares query conditions with the table's <literal>CHECK</literal>
        constraints, and omits scanning tables for which the conditions
        contradict the constraints.  For example:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE parent(key integer, ...);
CREATE TABLE child1000(check (key between 1000 and 1999)) INHERITS(parent);
CREATE TABLE child2000(check (key between 2000 and 2999)) INHERITS(parent);
...
SELECT * FROM parent WHERE key = 2400;
</programlisting>

        With constraint exclusion enabled, this <command>SELECT</command>
        will not scan <structname>child1000</structname> at all, improving performance.

       <para>
        Currently, constraint exclusion is enabled by default
        only for cases that are often used to implement table partitioning via
        inheritance trees.  Turning it on for all tables imposes extra
        planning overhead that is quite noticeable on simple queries, and most
        often will yield no benefit for simple queries.  If you have no
        tables that are partitioned using traditional inheritance, you might
        prefer to turn it off entirely.  (Note that the equivalent feature for
        partitioned tables is controlled by a separate parameter,

        Sets the planner's estimate of the fraction of a cursor's rows that
        will be retrieved.  The default is 0.1.  Smaller values of this
        setting bias the planner towards using <quote>fast start</quote> plans
        for cursors, which will retrieve the first few rows quickly while
        perhaps taking a long time to fetch all rows.  Larger values
        put more emphasis on the total estimated time.  At the maximum
        setting of 1.0, cursors are planned exactly like regular queries,
        considering only the total estimated time and not how soon the
        first rows might be delivered.

        By default, this variable is set the same as
        <varname>from_collapse_limit</varname>, which is appropriate
        for most uses. Setting it to 1 prevents any reordering of
        explicit <literal>JOIN</literal>s. Thus, the explicit join order
        specified in the query will be the actual order in which the
        relations are joined. Because the query planner does not always choose
        the optimal join order, advanced users can elect to
        temporarily set this variable to 1, and then specify the join
        order they desire explicitly.

        Prepared statements (either explicitly prepared or implicitly
        generated, for example by PL/pgSQL) can be executed using custom or
        generic plans.  Custom plans are made afresh for each execution
        using its specific set of parameter values, while generic plans do
        not rely on the parameter values and can be re-used across
        executions.  Thus, use of a generic plan saves planning time, but if
        the ideal plan depends strongly on the parameter values then a
        generic plan may be inefficient.  The choice between these options
        is normally made automatically, but it can be overridden
        with <varname>plan_cache_mode</varname>.
        The allowed values are <literal>auto</literal> (the default),
        <literal>force_custom_plan</literal> and
        <literal>force_generic_plan</literal>.
        This setting is considered when a cached plan is to be executed,
        not when it is prepared.

         parameter to a list of desired log destinations separated by
         commas. The default is to log to <systemitem>stderr</systemitem>
         only.
         This parameter can only be set in the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>
         file or on the server command line.

       <para>
        If <systemitem>csvlog</systemitem> is included in <varname>log_destination</varname>,

        When either <systemitem>stderr</systemitem>,

        record the location of the log file(s) currently in use by the logging
        collector and the associated logging destination. This provides a
        convenient way to find the logs currently in use by the instance. Here
        is an example of this file's content:
<programlisting>
stderr log/postgresql.log
csvlog log/postgresql.csv
jsonlog log/postgresql.json
</programlisting>

        <filename>current_logfiles</filename> is recreated when a new log file
        is created as an effect of rotation, and
        when <varname>log_destination</varname> is reloaded.  It is removed when
        none of <systemitem>stderr</systemitem>,
        <systemitem>csvlog</systemitem> or <systemitem>jsonlog</systemitem> are
        included in <varname>log_destination</varname>, and when the logging
        collector is disabled.

         is a background process that captures log messages
         sent to <systemitem>stderr</systemitem> and redirects them into log files.
         This approach is often more useful than
         logging to <application>syslog</application>, since some types of messages
         might not appear in <application>syslog</application> output.  (One common
         example is dynamic-linker failure messages; another is error messages
         produced by scripts such as <varname>archive_command</varname>.)

       <note>
        <para>
         It is possible to log to <systemitem>stderr</systemitem> without using the
         logging collector; the log messages will just go to wherever the
         server's <systemitem>stderr</systemitem> is directed.  However, that method is
         only suitable for low log volumes, since it provides no convenient
         way to rotate log files.  Also, on some platforms not using the
         logging collector can result in lost or garbled log output, because
         multiple processes writing concurrently to the same log file can
         overwrite each other's output.

       </note>

       <note>
        <para>
          The logging collector is designed to never lose messages.  This means
          that in case of extremely high load, server processes could be
          blocked while trying to send additional log messages when the
          collector has fallen behind.  In contrast, <application>syslog</application>
          prefers to drop messages if it cannot write them, which means it
          may fail to log some messages in such cases but it will not block
          the rest of the system.

        If you specify a file name without escapes, you should plan to

        this parameter will cause <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to truncate (overwrite),
        rather than append to, any existing log file of the same name.
        However, truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened
        due to time-based rotation, not during server startup or size-based
        rotation.  When off, pre-existing files will be appended to in
        all cases.  For example, using this setting in combination with
        a <varname>log_filename</varname> like <literal>postgresql-%H.log</literal>
        would result in generating twenty-four hourly log files and then
        cyclically overwriting them.
        This parameter can only be set in the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>
        file or on the server command line.
       </para>
       <para>
        Example:  To keep 7 days of logs, one log file per day named
        <literal>server_log.Mon</literal>, <literal>server_log.Tue</literal>,
        etc., and automatically overwrite last week's log with this week's log,
        set <varname>log_filename</varname> to <literal>server_log.%a</literal>,
        <varname>log_truncate_on_rotation</varname> to <literal>on</literal>, and
        <varname>log_rotation_age</varname> to <literal>1440</literal>.
       </para>
       <para>
        Example: To keep 24 hours of logs, one log file per hour, but
        also rotate sooner if the log file size exceeds 1GB, set
        <varname>log_filename</varname> to <literal>server_log.%H%M</literal>,
        <varname>log_truncate_on_rotation</varname> to <literal>on</literal>,
        <varname>log_rotation_age</varname> to <literal>60</literal>, and
        <varname>log_rotation_size</varname> to <literal>1000000</literal>.
        Including <literal>%M</literal> in <varname>log_filename</varname> allows
        any size-driven rotations that might occur to select a file name
        different from the hour's initial file name.

        When logging to <application>syslog</application> is enabled, this parameter
        determines how messages are delivered to syslog.  When on (the
        default), messages are split by lines, and long lines are split so
        that they will fit into 1024 bytes, which is a typical size limit for
        traditional syslog implementations.  When off, PostgreSQL server log
        messages are delivered to the syslog service as is, and it is up to
        the syslog service to cope with the potentially bulky messages.
       </para>

       <para>
        If syslog is ultimately logging to a text file, then the effect will
        be the same either way, and it is best to leave the setting on, since
        most syslog implementations either cannot handle large messages or
        would need to be specially configured to handle them.  But if syslog
        is ultimately writing into some other medium, it might be necessary or
        more useful to keep messages logically together.

        These parameters enable various debugging output to be emitted.
        When set, they print the resulting parse tree, the query rewriter
        output, or the execution plan for each executed query.
        These messages are emitted at <literal>LOG</literal> message level, so by
        default they will appear in the server log but will not be sent to the
        client.  You can change that by adjusting

        Causes each action executed by autovacuum to be logged if it ran for at

        all autovacuum actions. <literal>-1</literal> disables logging autovacuum
        actions. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        For example, if you set this to
        <literal>250ms</literal> then all automatic vacuums and analyzes that run
        250ms or longer will be logged.  In addition, when this parameter is

        logged if an autovacuum action is skipped due to a conflicting lock or a
        concurrently dropped relation. The default is <literal>10min</literal>.

         The difference between enabling <varname>log_duration</varname> and setting

         exceeding <varname>log_min_duration_statement</varname> forces the text of
         the query to be logged, but this option doesn't.  Thus, if
         <varname>log_duration</varname> is <literal>on</literal> and
         <varname>log_min_duration_statement</varname> has a positive value, all
         durations are logged but the query text is included only for
         statements exceeding the threshold.  This behavior can be useful for
         gathering statistics in high-load installations.

         This is a <function>printf</function>-style string that is output at the

         <literal>%</literal> characters begin <quote>escape sequences</quote>
         that are replaced with status information as outlined below.
         Unrecognized escapes are ignored. Other
         characters are copied straight to the log line. Some escapes are
         only recognized by session processes, and will be treated as empty by
         background processes such as the main server process. Status
         information may be aligned either left or right by specifying a
         numeric literal after the % and before the option. A negative
         value will cause the status information to be padded on the
         right with spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive
         value will pad on the left. Padding can be useful to aid human
         readability in log files.

         If you set a nonempty value for <varname>log_line_prefix</varname>,
         you should usually make its last character be a space, to provide
         visual separation from the rest of the log line.  A punctuation

       <para>
        Including <literal>csvlog</literal> in the <varname>log_destination</varname> list
        provides a convenient way to import log files into a database table.
        This option emits log lines in comma-separated-values
        (<acronym>CSV</acronym>) format,
        with these columns:
        time stamp with milliseconds,
        user name,
        database name,
        process ID,
        client host:port number,
        session ID,
        per-session line number,
        command tag,
        session start time,
        virtual transaction ID,
        regular transaction ID,
        error severity,
        SQLSTATE code,
        error message,
        error message detail,
        hint,
        internal query that led to the error (if any),
        character count of the error position therein,
        error context,
        user query that led to the error (if any and enabled by
        <varname>log_min_error_statement</varname>),
        character count of the error position therein,
        location of the error in the PostgreSQL source code
        (if <varname>log_error_verbosity</varname> is set to <literal>verbose</literal>),
        application name, backend type, process ID of parallel group leader,
        and query id.
        Here is a sample table definition for storing CSV-format log output:

<programlisting>

           The table definition above includes a primary key specification.
           This is useful to protect against accidentally importing the same
           information twice.  The <command>COPY</command> command commits all of the
           data it imports at one time, so any error will cause the entire
           import to fail.  If you import a partial log file and later import
           the file again when it is complete, the primary key violation will
           cause the import to fail.  Wait until the log is complete and
           closed before importing.  This procedure will also protect against
           accidentally importing a partial line that hasn't been completely
           written, which would also cause <command>COPY</command> to fail.

        Determines the behavior when cumulative statistics are accessed
        multiple times within a transaction. When set to
        <literal>none</literal>, each access re-fetches counters from shared
        memory. When set to <literal>cache</literal>, the first access to
        statistics for an object caches those statistics until the end of the
        transaction unless <function>pg_stat_clear_snapshot()</function> is
        called. When set to <literal>snapshot</literal>, the first statistics
        access caches all statistics accessible in the current database, until
        the end of the transaction unless
        <function>pg_stat_clear_snapshot()</function> is called. Changing this
        parameter in a transaction discards the statistics snapshot.

       <note>
        <para>
         <literal>none</literal> is most suitable for monitoring systems. If

         efficient. <literal>cache</literal> ensures repeat accesses yield the
         same values, which is important for queries involving

        The <xref linkend="pgstatstatements"/> extension also requires a query

     <para>
      During the execution of <xref linkend="sql-vacuum"/>
      and <xref linkend="sql-analyze"/>
      commands, the system maintains an
      internal counter that keeps track of the estimated cost of the
      various I/O operations that are performed.  When the accumulated
      cost reaches a limit (specified by
      <varname>vacuum_cost_limit</varname>), the process performing
      the operation will sleep for a short period of time, as specified by
      <varname>vacuum_cost_delay</varname>. Then it will reset the
      counter and continue execution.
     </para>

     <para>
      The intent of this feature is to allow administrators to reduce
      the I/O impact of these commands on concurrent database
      activity. There are many situations where it is not
      important that maintenance commands like
      <command>VACUUM</command> and <command>ANALYZE</command> finish
      quickly; however, it is usually very important that these
      commands do not significantly interfere with the ability of the
      system to perform other database operations. Cost-based vacuum
      delay provides a way for administrators to achieve this.

         When using cost-based vacuuming, appropriate values for

         less than 1 millisecond.  While <varname>vacuum_cost_delay</varname>
         can be set to fractional-millisecond values, such delays may not be
         measured accurately on older platforms.  On such platforms,
         increasing <command>VACUUM</command>'s throttled resource consumption
         above what you get at 1ms will require changing the other vacuum cost
         parameters.  You should, nonetheless,
         keep <varname>vacuum_cost_delay</varname> as small as your platform
         will consistently measure; large delays are not helpful.

       There are certain operations that hold critical locks and should
       therefore complete as quickly as possible.  Cost-based vacuum
       delays do not occur during such operations.  Therefore it is
       possible that the cost accumulates far higher than the specified
       limit.  To avoid uselessly long delays in such cases, the actual
       delay is calculated as <varname>vacuum_cost_delay</varname> *
       <varname>accumulated_balance</varname> /
       <varname>vacuum_cost_limit</varname> with a maximum of

     <para>
      To maintain correctness even after transaction IDs wrap around,
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> marks rows that are sufficiently
      old as <emphasis>frozen</emphasis>. These rows are visible to everyone;
      other transactions do not need to examine their inserting XID to
      determine visibility. <command>VACUUM</command> is responsible for
      marking rows as frozen. The following settings control
      <command>VACUUM</command>'s freezing behavior and should be tuned based
      on the XID consumption rate of the system and data access patterns of the
      dominant workloads. See <xref linkend="vacuum-for-wraparound"/> for more
      information on transaction ID wraparound and tuning these parameters.

        Possible values are <literal>origin</literal> (the default),

        Setting this parameter results in discarding any previously cached

        The intended use of this setting is that logical replication systems

        changes.  The effect of that will be that triggers and rules (that
        have not been altered from their default configuration) will not fire

        PostgreSQL treats the settings <literal>origin</literal> and

       <para>
        Since foreign keys are implemented as triggers, setting this parameter

        The timeout is measured from the time a command arrives at the

        is applied to each statement separately.
        (<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> versions before 13 usually
        treated the timeout as applying to the whole query string.)
        In extended query protocol, the timeout starts running when any
        query-related message (Parse, Bind, Execute, Describe) arrives, and
        it is canceled by completion of an Execute or Sync message.

        If the value is 1 (the default) or above, float values are output in

        actual number of digits generated depends only on the value being
        output, not on the value of this parameter. At most 17 digits are
        required for <type>float8</type> values, and 9 for <type>float4</type>
        values. This format is both fast and precise, preserving the original
        binary float value exactly when correctly read. For historical

       </para>
       <para>
        If the value is zero or negative, then the output is rounded to a

        digits, and <type>float8</type> values
        rounded to 14 digits.) This format is slower and does not preserve all

        Some libraries need to perform certain operations that can only take
        place at postmaster start, such as allocating shared memory, reserving
        light-weight locks, or starting background workers.  Those libraries
        must be loaded at server start through this parameter.  See the
        documentation of each library for details.
       </para>

       <para>
        Other libraries can also be preloaded.  By preloading a shared library,
        the library startup time is avoided when the library is first used.
        However, the time to start each new server process might increase
        slightly, even if that process never uses the library.  So this
        parameter is recommended only for libraries that will be used in most
        sessions.  Also, changing this parameter requires a server restart, so
        this is not the right setting to use for short-term debugging tasks,
        say.  Use <xref linkend="guc-session-preload-libraries"/> for that
        instead.

      <note>
       <para>
        On Windows hosts, preloading a library at server start will not reduce
        the time required to start each new server process; each server process
        will re-load all preload libraries.  However, <varname>shared_preload_libraries
        </varname> is still useful on Windows hosts for libraries that need to

        This is the amount of time to wait on a lock
        before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The
        check for deadlock is relatively expensive, so the server doesn't run
        it every time it waits for a lock. We optimistically assume
        that deadlocks are not common in production applications and
        just wait on the lock for a while before checking for a
        deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time
        wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of
        real deadlock errors.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default is one second (<literal>1s</literal>),
        which is probably about the smallest value you would want in
        practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it.
        Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time,
        so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before
        the waiter decides to check for deadlock.
        Only superusers and users with the appropriate <literal>SET</literal>
        privilege can change this setting.

        This controls whether ordinary string literals

        Beginning in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.1, the default is

        Applications can check this

        The presence of this parameter can also be taken as an indication
        that the escape string syntax (<literal>E'...'</literal>) is supported.
        Escape string syntax (<xref linkend="sql-syntax-strings-escape"/>)

        This allows sequential scans of large tables to synchronize with each
        other, so that concurrent scans read the same block at about the
        same time and hence share the I/O workload.  When this is enabled,
        a scan might start in the middle of the table and then <quote>wrap
        around</quote> the end to cover all rows, so as to synchronize with the
        activity of scans already in progress.  This can result in
        unpredictable changes in the row ordering returned by queries that
        have no <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clause.  Setting this parameter to

        When on, expressions of the form <literal><replaceable>expr</replaceable> =

        However, filtered forms in <productname>Microsoft

        return the null value (using the SQL standard interpretation), they are not
        very useful and do not appear often in normal applications so
        this option does little harm in practice.  But new users are

        begins.  The search for files will follow symbolic links for the WAL
        directory and each configured tablespace (but not any other symbolic

        doesn't need to open each file one by one.  On the other hand, it may

     This feature was designed to allow parameters not normally known to

     will accept a setting for any two-part parameter name.  Such variables
     are treated as placeholders and have no function until the module that
     defines them is loaded. When an extension module is loaded, it will add
     its variable definitions and convert any placeholder values according to
     those definitions.  If there are any unrecognized placeholders
     that begin with its extension name, warnings are issued and those

        When set to <literal>1</literal>, each system catalog cache entry is

        Allows the use of parallel queries for testing purposes even in cases

        The allowed values of <varname>debug_parallel_query</varname> are
        <literal>off</literal> (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve
        performance), <literal>on</literal> (force parallel query for all queries

       <para>
        More specifically, setting this value to <literal>on</literal> will add
        a <literal>Gather</literal> node to the top of any query plan for which this
        appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker.
        Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used,
        operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited
        in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner
        believes that this will cause the query to fail.  If failures or
        unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used
        by the query may need to be marked <literal>PARALLEL UNSAFE</literal>
        (or, possibly, <literal>PARALLEL RESTRICTED</literal>).
       </para>

       <para>
        Setting this value to <literal>regress</literal> has all of the same effects
        as setting it to <literal>on</literal> plus some additional effects that are
        intended to facilitate automated regression testing.  Normally,
        messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that,
        but a setting of <literal>regress</literal> suppresses this line so that the
        output is the same as in non-parallel execution.  Also,
        the <literal>Gather</literal> nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden
        in <literal>EXPLAIN</literal> output so that the output matches what
        would be obtained if this setting were turned <literal>off</literal>.

        match the stored images.  In certain cases (such as hint bits), minor

        By default, after a backend crash the postmaster will stop remaining
        child processes by sending them <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem>
        signals, which permits them to exit more-or-less gracefully.  When
        this option is set to <literal>on</literal>,
        <systemitem>SIGABRT</systemitem> is sent instead.  That normally
        results in production of a core dump file for each such child
        process.
        This can be handy for investigating the states of other processes
        after a crash.  It can also consume lots of disk space in the event
        of repeated crashes, so do not enable this on systems you are not
        monitoring carefully.
        Beware that no support exists for cleaning up the core file(s)
        automatically.
        This parameter can only be set in
        the <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> file or on the server
        command line.

        By default, after attempting to stop a child process with
        <systemitem>SIGQUIT</systemitem>, the postmaster will wait five
        seconds and then send <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem> to force
        immediate termination.  When this option is set
        to <literal>on</literal>, <systemitem>SIGABRT</systemitem> is sent
        instead of <systemitem>SIGKILL</systemitem>.  That normally results
        in production of a core dump file for each such child process.
        This can be handy for investigating the states

        The allowed values are <literal>buffered</literal> and
        <literal>immediate</literal>. The default is <literal>buffered</literal>.
        This parameter is intended to be used to test logical decoding and
        replication of large transactions.  The effect of
        <varname>debug_logical_replication_streaming</varname> is different for the
        publisher and subscriber:
       </para>

       <para>
        On the publisher side, <varname>debug_logical_replication_streaming</varname>
        allows streaming or serializing changes immediately in logical decoding.
        When set to <literal>immediate</literal>, stream each change if the
        <link linkend="sql-createsubscription-params-with-streaming"><literal>streaming</literal></link>
        option of
        <link linkend="sql-createsubscription"><command>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</command></link>
        is enabled, otherwise, serialize each change.  When set to
        <literal>buffered</literal>, the decoding will stream or serialize
        changes when <varname>logical_decoding_work_mem</varname> is reached.
       </para>

       <para>
        On the subscriber side, if the <literal>streaming</literal> option is set to
        <literal>parallel</literal>, <varname>debug_logical_replication_streaming</varname>
        can be used to direct the leader apply worker to send changes to the
        shared memory queue or to serialize all changes to the file.  When set to
        <literal>buffered</literal>, the leader sends changes to parallel apply
        workers via a shared memory queue.  When set to
        <literal>immediate</literal>, the leader serializes all changes to files
        and notifies the parallel apply workers to read and apply them at the
        end of the transaction.
