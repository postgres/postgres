# These are generated by generate-wait_event_types.pl, whose format

# This confuses pgindent, and it's a derived file anyway.

#
# pgindent might mangle entries in this that match typedef names.
# Since it's a derived file anyway, just exclude it.
src/backend/utils/fmgrprotos\.h$
#
# kwlist_d files are made by gen_keywordlist.pl.  While we could insist that
# they match pgindent style, they'd look worse not better, so exclude them.

# These are generated by the scripts from src/common/unicode/.  They use

#
# src/include/snowball/libstemmer/ and src/backend/snowball/libstemmer/
# are excluded because those files are imported from an external project,
# rather than maintained locally, and they are machine-generated anyway.
/snowball/libstemmer/
#
# These files are machine-generated by code not under our control,
# so we shouldn't expect them to conform to our style.
