  <title>Tutorial</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    Welcome to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> Tutorial.  The
    tutorial is intended to give an introduction
    to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, relational database
    concepts, and the SQL language. We assume some general knowledge about
    how to use computers and no particular Unix or programming experience is
    required.  This tutorial is intended to provide hands-on experience with
    important aspects of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> system.
    It makes no attempt to be a comprehensive treatment of the topics it covers.
   </para>

   <para>
    After you have successfully completed this tutorial you will want to
    read the <xref linkend="sql"/> section to gain a better understanding
    of the SQL language, or <xref linkend="client-interfaces"/> for
    information about developing applications with
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  Those who provision and
    manage their own PostgreSQL installation should also read <xref linkend="admin"/>.

 <part id="sql">
  <title>The SQL Language</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part describes the use of the <acronym>SQL</acronym> language
    in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  We start with
    describing the general syntax of <acronym>SQL</acronym>, then
    how to create tables, how to populate the database, and how to
    query it.  The middle part lists the available data types and
    functions for use in <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands.  Lastly,
    we address several aspects of importance for tuning a database.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information is arranged so that a novice user can
    follow it from start to end and gain a full understanding of the topics
    without having to refer forward too many times.  The chapters are
    intended to be self-contained, so that advanced users can read the
    chapters individually as they choose.  The information is presented
    in narrative form with topical units. Readers looking for a complete
    description of a particular command are encouraged to review
    the <xref linkend="reference"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Readers should know how to connect to a
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database and issue
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands.  Readers that are unfamiliar with
    these issues are encouraged to read <xref linkend="tutorial"/>
    first.  <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands are typically entered
    using the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> interactive terminal
    <application>psql</application>, but other programs that have
    similar functionality can be used as well.

  <title>Server Administration</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part covers topics that are of interest to a
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> administrator.  This includes
    installation, configuration of the server, management of users
    and databases, and maintenance tasks. Anyone running
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server, even for
    personal use, but especially in production, should be familiar
    with these topics.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information attempts to be in the order in which
    a new user should read it.  The chapters are self-contained and
    can be read individually as desired.  The information is presented
    in a narrative form in topical units.  Readers looking for a complete
    description of a command are encouraged to review the
    <xref linkend="reference"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The first few chapters are written so they can be understood
    without prerequisite knowledge, so new users who need to set
    up their own server can begin their exploration. The rest of this
    part is about tuning and management; that material
    assumes that the reader is familiar with the general use of
    the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database system.  Readers are
    encouraged review the <xref linkend="tutorial"/> and <xref
    linkend="sql"/> parts for additional information.

  <title>Client Interfaces</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part describes the client programming interfaces distributed
    with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  Each of these chapters can be
    read independently.  There are many external programming
    interfaces for client programs that are distributed separately. They
    contain their own documentation (<xref linkend="external-projects"/>
    lists some of the more popular ones).  Readers of this part should be
    familiar with using <acronym>SQL</acronym> to manipulate
    and query the database (see <xref linkend="sql"/>) and of course
    with the programming language of their choice.

  <title>Server Programming</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part is about extending the server functionality with
    user-defined functions, data types, triggers, etc.  These are
    advanced topics which should be approached only after all
    the other user documentation about <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
    been understood.  Later chapters in this part describe the server-side
    programming languages available in the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution as well as
    general issues concerning server-side programming.  It
    is essential to read at least the earlier sections of <xref
    linkend="extend"/> (covering functions) before diving into the
    material about server-side programming.
