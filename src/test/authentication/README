Regression tests for authentication
===================================

This directory contains a test suite for authentication. SSL certificate
authentication tests are kept separate, in src/test/ssl/, because they
are more complicated, and are not safe to run in a multi-user system.


Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster.
