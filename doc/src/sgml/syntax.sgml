  <title>SQL Syntax</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    A description of the general syntax of SQL.
   </para>
  </abstract>

  <para>
   <acronym>SQL</acronym> manipulates sets of data. The language is
   composed of various <firstterm>key words</firstterm>. Arithmetic
   and procedural expressions are allowed. We will cover these topics
   in this chapter; subsequent chapters will include details on data
   types, functions, and operators.
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title>Key Words</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> defines <firstterm>key words</firstterm> 
    for the language
    which have specific meaning. Some key words are
    <firstterm>reserved</firstterm>, which indicates that they are
    restricted to appear in only certain contexts. Other key words are
    <firstterm>not restricted</firstterm>, which indicates that in certain 
    contexts they
    have a specific meaning but are not otherwise constrained.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>Postgres</productname> implements an extended subset of the
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> languages. Some language
    elements are not as restricted in this implementation as is
    called for in the language standards, in part due
    to the extensibility features of <productname>Postgres</productname>. 
   </para>

   <para>
    Information on <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> key words
    is derived from <xref linkend="DATE97" endterm="DATE97">.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Reserved Key Words</title>

    <para>
     <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> have 
     <firstterm>reserved key words</firstterm> which are not allowed 
     as identifiers and not allowed in any usage other than as fundamental
     tokens in <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements.
     <productname>Postgres</productname> has additional key words
     which have similar restrictions. In particular, these key words
     are not allowed as column or table names, though in some cases
     they are allowed to be column labels (i.e. in AS clauses).
    </para>

    <tip>
     <para>
      Any string can be specified as an identifier if surrounded by
      double quotes (<quote>like this!</quote>). Some care is required since
      such an identifier will be case sensitive
      and will retain embedded whitespace other special characters.
     </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
     The following are <productname>Postgres</productname>
     reserved words which are neither <acronym>SQL92</acronym>
     nor <acronym>SQL3</acronym> reserved words. These are allowed
     to be present as column labels, but not as identifiers:

    <para>
     The following are either <acronym>SQL92</acronym>

     which are not key words in <productname>Postgres</productname>.
     These have no proscribed usage in <productname>Postgres</productname>
     at the time of writing (v6.5) but may become reserved key words in the
     future:

     <note>
      <para>
       Some of these key words represent functions in <acronym>SQL92</acronym>.
       These functions are defined in <productname>Postgres</productname>,
       but the parser does not consider the names to be key words and they are allowed
       in other contexts.

     <firstterm>non-reserved keywords</firstterm> which have
     a prescribed meaning in the language but which are also allowed

     In particular, these keywords
     are allowed as column or table names.

   <title>Comments</title>

   <para>
    A <firstterm>comment</firstterm>
    is an arbitrary sequence of characters following double dashes up to the end
    of the line.  We also support double-slashes as comments, e.g.:

    <programlisting>
-- This is a standard SQL comment
// And this is another supported comment style, like C++
    </programlisting>

We also support C-style block comments, e.g.:

    <programlisting>
/* multi
   line
   comment
 */
    </programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Names</title>

   <para>
    Names in SQL are sequences of less than NAMEDATALEN alphanumeric characters,
    starting with an alphabetic character.  By default, NAMEDATALEN is set
    to 32, but at the time the system is built, NAMEDATALEN can be changed
    by changing the <literal>#define</literal> in
    src/backend/include/postgres.h.
    Underscore ("_") is considered an alphabetic character.
   </para>

   <para>
    In some contexts, names may contain other characters if surrounded 
    by double quotes. For example, table or column names may contain otherwise
    disallowed characters such as spaces, ampersands, etc. using this
    technique.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Constants</title>

   <para>
    There are three <firstterm>implicitly typed constants</firstterm>
    for use in <productname>Postgres</productname>: strings, integers, 
    and floating point numbers.  Constants can
    also be specified with explicit types, which can enable more
    accurate representation and more efficient handling by the
    backend. The implicit constants are described below; explicit
    constants are discussed afterwards.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>String Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Strings</firstterm>
     in SQL are arbitrary sequences of ASCII characters bounded by single
     quotes ("'", e.g. <literal>'This is a string'</literal>).
     Uppercase alphabetics within strings are accepted
     literally.  Non-printing characters may be embedded within strings by
     prepending them with a backslash
     ("\"; e.g. "\<replaceable>tab</replaceable>".
     SQL92 allows single quotes to be embedded in strings by typing two 
     adjacent single quotes (e.g. 'Dianne''s horse'), and for
     historical reasons <productname>Postgres</productname> also allows 
     single quotes to be escaped with a backslash
     (e.g. 'Dianne\'s horse').
    </para>

    <para>
     Because of the limitations on
     instance sizes, string constants are currently limited to a length of
     a little less than 8192 bytes.  Larger strings may be handled using the
     Postgres Large Object interface.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Integer Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Integer constants</firstterm>
     in SQL are collection of ASCII digits with no decimal point.  Legal
     values range from -2147483648 to +2147483647.  This will vary
     depending on the operating system and host machine.
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that larger integers can be specified for <type>int8</type>
     by using <acronym>SQL92</acronym> string notation or
     <productname>Postgres</productname> type notation:

     <programlisting>
int8 '4000000000'  -- string style
'4000000000'::int8 -- Postgres (historical) style
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Floating Point Constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Floating point constants</firstterm>
     consist of an integer part, a decimal point, and a fraction part or
     scientific notation of the following format:

     <synopsis>
{<replaceable>dig</replaceable>}.{<replaceable>dig</replaceable>} [e [+-] {<replaceable>dig</replaceable>}]
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>dig</replaceable> is one or more digits.
     You must include at least one <replaceable>dig</replaceable> after the
     period and after the [+-] if you use those options.  An exponent with
     a missing mantissa has a mantissa of 1 inserted.  There may be no
     extra characters embedded in the string.
    </para>

    <para>
     Floating point constaints are of type
     <type>float8</type>. <type>float4</type> can be specified
     explicitly by using <acronym>SQL92</acronym> string notation or
     <productname>Postgres</productname> type notation:

     <programlisting>
float4 '1.23'  -- string style
'1.23'::float4 -- Postgres (historical) style
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Constants of Postgres User-Defined Types</title>

    <para>
     A constant of an
     <emphasis>arbitrary</emphasis>
     type can be entered using any one of the following notations:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>type</replaceable> '<replaceable>string</replaceable>'
'<replaceable>string</replaceable>'::<replaceable>type</replaceable>
CAST '<replaceable>string</replaceable>' AS <replaceable>type</replaceable>
     </synopsis>

     The value inside the string is passed to the input
     conversion routine for the type called
     <replaceable>type</replaceable>. The result is a
     constant of the indicated type.  The explicit typecast may be omitted
     if there is no ambiguity as to the type the constant must be, in which
     case it is automatically coerced.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Array constants</title>

    <para>
     <firstterm>Array constants</firstterm>
     are arrays of any Postgres type, including other arrays, string
     constants, etc.  The general format of an array constant is the
     following:

     <synopsis>
{<replaceable>val1</replaceable><replaceable>delim</replaceable><replaceable>val2</replaceable><replaceable>delim</replaceable>}
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>delim</replaceable>
     is the delimiter for the type stored in the <literal>pg_type</literal> class.
     (For built-in types, this is the comma character (",").  An
     example of an array constant is

     <programlisting>
{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
     </programlisting>

     This constant is a two-dimensional, 3 by 3 array consisting of three
     sub-arrays of integers.
    </para>

    <para>
     Individual array elements can and should be placed between quotation
     marks whenever possible to avoid ambiguity problems with respect to
     leading white space.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Fields and Columns</title>

   <sect2>
    <title>Fields</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>field</firstterm>
     is either an attribute of a given class or one of the following:

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>oid</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 stands for the unique identifier of an instance which is added by
	 Postgres to all instances automatically. Oids are not reused and are 32
	 bit quantities.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>xmin</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 The identity of the inserting transaction.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>xmax</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 The identity of the deleting transaction.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>cmin</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 The command identifier within the transaction.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
      <term>cmax</term>
       <listitem>
	<para>
	 The identity of the deleting command.
	</para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
     For further information on these fields consult
     <xref linkend="STON87a" endterm="STON87a">.
     Times are represented internally as instances of the
     <literal>abstime</literal>
     data type.  Transaction and command identifiers are 32 bit quantities.
     Transactions are assigned sequentially starting at 512.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Columns</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>column</firstterm> is a construct of the form:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>instance</replaceable>{.<replaceable>composite_field</replaceable>}.<replaceable>field</replaceable> `['<replaceable>number</replaceable>`]'
     </synopsis>

     <replaceable>instance</replaceable>
     identifies a particular class and can be thought of as standing for
     the instances of that class.  An instance variable is either a class
     name, a surrogate for a class defined by means of a FROM clause,
     or the keyword NEW or CURRENT.
     NEW and CURRENT can only appear in the action portion of a rule, while
     other instance variables can be used in any SQL statement.
     <replaceable>composite_field</replaceable>
     is a field of of one of the Postgres composite types,
     while successive composite fields address attributes in the
     class(s) to which the composite field evaluates.  Lastly,
     <replaceable>field</replaceable>
     is a normal (base type) field in the class(s) last addressed.  If
     <replaceable>field</replaceable>
     is of type <literal>array</literal>,
     then the optional <replaceable>number</replaceable>
     designator indicates a specific element in the array.  If no number is
     indicated, then all array elements are returned.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Operators</title>

   <para>
    Any built-in system, or user-defined operator may be used in SQL.
    For the list of built-in and system operators consult
    <xref linkend="operators" endterm="operators-title">.
    For a list of user-defined operators consult your system administrator
    or run a query on the <literal>pg_operator</literal> class.
    Parentheses may be used for arbitrary grouping of operators in expressions.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Expressions</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> allows <firstterm>expressions</firstterm>
    to transform data in tables. Expressions may contain operators
    (see <xref linkend="operators" endterm="operators-title">
    for more details) and functions
    (<xref linkend="functions" endterm="functions-title"> has
    more information).
   </para>

   <para>
    An expression is one of the following:

    <simplelist>
     <member>( a_expr )</member>
     <member>constant</member>
     <member>attribute</member>
     <member><replaceable>a_expr</replaceable> <replaceable>binary_operator</replaceable> <replaceable>a_expr</replaceable></member>
     <member><replaceable>a_expr</replaceable> <replaceable>right_unary_operator</replaceable></member>
     <member><replaceable>left_unary_operator</replaceable> <replaceable>a_expr</replaceable></member>
     <member>parameter</member>
     <member>functional expressions</member>
     <member>aggregate expressions</member>
    </simplelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    We have already discussed constants and attributes.  The two kinds of
    operator expressions indicate respectively binary and left_unary
    expressions.  The following sections discuss the remaining options.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Parameters</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>parameter</firstterm>
     is used to indicate a parameter in a SQL function.  Typically this
     is used in SQL function definition statement.  The form of a
     parameter is:

     <synopsis>
$<replaceable class="parameter">number</replaceable>
     </synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     For example, consider the definition of a function,
     <function>dept</function>, as

     <programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION dept (name)
	RETURNS dept
	AS 'select * from 
	    dept where name=$1'
	LANGUAGE 'sql';
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Functional Expressions</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>functional expression</firstterm>
     is the name of a legal SQL function, followed by its argument list
     enclosed in parentheses:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>function</replaceable> (<replaceable>a_expr</replaceable> [, <replaceable>a_expr</replaceable> )
     </synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     For example, the following computes the square root of an employee
     salary:

     <programlisting>
sqrt(emp.salary)
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Aggregate Expression</title>

    <para>
     An <firstterm>aggregate expression</firstterm>
     represents a simple aggregate (i.e., one that computes a single value)
     or an aggregate function (i.e., one that computes a set of values).
     The syntax is the following:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable> (<replaceable>attribute</replaceable>)
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>aggregate_name</replaceable>
     must be a previously defined aggregate.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Target List</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>target list</firstterm>
     is a parenthesized, comma-separated list of one or more elements, each
     of which must be of the form:

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>a_expr</replaceable> [ AS <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable> ]
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable>
     is the name of the attribute to be created (or an
     already existing attribute name in the case of update statements.)  If
     <replaceable>result_attname</replaceable>
     is not present, then 
     <replaceable>a_expr</replaceable>
     must contain only one attribute name which is assumed to be the name
     of the result field.  In <productname>Postgres</productname>
     default naming is only used if
     <replaceable>a_expr</replaceable>
     is an attribute.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Qualification</title>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>qualification</firstterm>
     consists of any number of clauses connected by the logical operators:

     <simplelist>
      <member>NOT</member>
      <member>AND</member>
      <member>OR</member>

    <title>From List</title>

    <para>
     The <firstterm>from list</firstterm>
     is a comma-separated list of <firstterm>from expressions</firstterm>.
     Each "from expression" is of the form:

     <synopsis>
[ <replaceable>class_reference</replaceable> ] <replaceable>instance_variable</replaceable>
	{, [ <replaceable>class_ref</replaceable> ] <replaceable>instance_variable</replaceable>... }
     </synopsis>

     where <replaceable>class_reference</replaceable>
     is of the form

     <synopsis>
<replaceable>class_name</replaceable> [ * ]
     </synopsis>

     The "from expression"
     defines one or more instance variables to range over the class
     indicated in <replaceable>class_reference</replaceable>.
     One can also request 
     the instance variable to range over all classes that are beneath the
     indicated class in the inheritance hierarchy by postpending the
     designator asterisk ("*").
