Subject: [HACKERS] Transaction ID wraparound: problem and proposed solution

We've expended a lot of worry and discussion in the past about what
happens if the OID generator wraps around.  However, there is another
4-byte counter in the system: the transaction ID (XID) generator.
While OID wraparound is survivable, if XIDs wrap around then we really
do have a Ragnarok scenario.  The tuple validity checks do ordered
comparisons on XIDs, and will consider tuples with xmin > current xact
to be invalid.  Result: after wraparound, your whole database would
instantly vanish from view.

The first thought that comes to mind is that XIDs should be promoted to
eight bytes.  However there are several practical problems with this:
* portability --- I don't believe long long int exists on all the
platforms we support.
* performance --- except on true 64-bit platforms, widening Datum to
eight bytes would be a system-wide performance hit, which is a tad
unpleasant to fix a scenario that's not yet been reported from the
field.
* disk space --- letting pg_log grow without bound isn't a pleasant
prospect either.

I believe it is possible to fix these problems without widening XID,
by redefining XIDs in a way that allows for wraparound.  Here's my
plan:

1. Allow XIDs to range from 0 to WRAPLIMIT-1 (WRAPLIMIT is not
necessarily 4G, see discussion below).  Ordered comparisons on XIDs
are no longer simply "x < y", but need to be expressed as a macro.
We consider x < y if (y - x) % WRAPLIMIT < WRAPLIMIT/2.
This comparison will work as long as the range of interesting XIDs
never exceeds WRAPLIMIT/2.  Essentially, we envision the actual value
of XID as being the low-order bits of a logical XID that always
increases, and we assume that no extant XID is more than WRAPLIMIT/2
transactions old, so we needn't keep track of the high-order bits.

2. To keep the system from having to deal with XIDs that are more than
WRAPLIMIT/2 transactions old, VACUUM should "freeze" known-good old
tuples.  To do this, we'll reserve a special XID, say 1, that is always
considered committed and is always less than any ordinary XID.  (So the
ordered-comparison macro is really a little more complicated than I said
above.  Note that there is already a reserved XID just like this in the
system, the "bootstrap" XID.  We could simply use the bootstrap XID, but
it seems better to make another one.)  When VACUUM finds a tuple that
is committed good and has xmin < XmaxRecent (the oldest XID that might
be considered uncommitted by any open transaction), it will replace that
tuple's xmin by the special always-good XID.  Therefore, as long as
VACUUM is run on all tables in the installation more often than once per
WRAPLIMIT/2 transactions, there will be no tuples with ordinary XIDs
older than WRAPLIMIT/2.

3. At wraparound, the XID counter has to be advanced to skip over the
InvalidXID value (zero) and the reserved XIDs, so that no real transaction
is generated with those XIDs.  No biggie here.

4. With the wraparound behavior, pg_log will have a bounded size: it
will never exceed WRAPLIMIT*2 bits = WRAPLIMIT/4 bytes.  Since we will
recycle pg_log entries every WRAPLIMIT xacts, during transaction start
the xact manager will have to take care to actively clear its pg_log
entry to zeroes (I'm not sure if it does that already, or just assumes
that new pg_log entries will start out zero).  As long as that happens
before the xact makes any data changes, it's OK to recycle the entry.
Note we are assuming that no tuples will remain in the database with
xmin or xmax equal to that XID from a prior cycle of the universe.

This scheme allows us to survive XID wraparound at the cost of slight
additional complexity in ordered comparisons of XIDs (which is not a
really performance-critical task AFAIK), and at the cost that the
original insertion XIDs of all but recent tuples will be lost by
VACUUM.  The system doesn't particularly care about that, but old XIDs
do sometimes come in handy for debugging purposes.  A possible
compromise is to overwrite only XIDs that are older than, say,
WRAPLIMIT/4 instead of doing so as soon as possible.  This would mean
the required VACUUM frequency is every WRAPLIMIT/4 xacts instead of
every WRAPLIMIT/2 xacts.

We have a straightforward tradeoff between the maximum size of pg_log
(WRAPLIMIT/4 bytes) and the required frequency of VACUUM (at least
every WRAPLIMIT/2 or WRAPLIMIT/4 transactions).  This could be made
configurable in config.h for those who're intent on customization,
but I'd be inclined to set the default value at WRAPLIMIT = 1G.

Comments?  Vadim, is any of this about to be superseded by WAL?
If not, I'd like to fix it for 7.1.

Well, yes, some transaction that continues running while ~ 500 million
other transactions come and go might give us trouble.  I wasn't really

I don't think this is a problem now; in practice you couldn't possibly
go for half a billion transactions without vacuuming, I'd think.

If your plans to eliminate regular vacuuming become reality, then this
scheme might become less reliable, but at present I think there's plenty
of safety margin.

So, we might eventually have a better answer from WAL, but not for 7.1.

I think my idea is reasonably non-invasive and could be removed without
much trouble once WAL offers a better way.  I'd really like to have some
answer for 7.1, though.  The sort of numbers John Scott was quoting to
me for Verizon's paging network throughput make it clear that we aren't
going to survive at that level with a limit of 4G transactions per
database reload.  Having to vacuum everything on at least a
1G-transaction cycle is salable, dump/initdb/reload is not ...

How's that going to improve matters?  pg_log is ground truth for XIDs;
if you can't distinguish two XIDs in pg_log, there's no point in
distinguishing them elsewhere.

It's not so much XIDs themselves, as that I think we'd need to widen
typedef Datum too, and that affects manipulations of *all* data types.

In any case, the prospect of a multi-gigabyte, ever-growing pg_log file,
with no way to recover the space short of dump/initdb/reload, is
awfully unappetizing for a high-traffic installation...

Agreed completely.  I'd like to think I could have such an installation
in the next year or so :)  

To prevent a performance hit to those who don't want, is there a
possibility of either a compile time option or 'auto-expanding' the
width of the XID's and other items when it becomes appropriate?  Start
with int4, when that limit is hit goto int8, and should -- quite
unbelievibly so but there are multi-TB databases -- it be necessary jump
to int12 or int16?   Be the first to support Exa-objects in an RDBMS. 
Testing not necessary ;)

Compiletime option would be appropriate however if theres a significant
performance hit.

I'm not much of a c coder (obviously), so I don't know of the
limitations.  plpgsql is my friend that can do nearly anything :)

Hmm... After reading the above I should have stuck with lurking.

Understandable. And probably we can get BAR too but require full
backup every WRAPLIMIT/2 (or better /4) transactions.

Not truncating, but implementing pg_log as set of files - we could remove
files for old xids.

> Vadim, can you explain how WAL will make pg_log unnecessary someday?

First, I mentioned only that having undo we could remove old pg_log after
postmaster startup because of only committed changes would be in data
files and they would be visible to new transactions (small changes in tqual
will be required to take page' startup id into account) which would reuse xids.
While changing a page first time in current startup, server would do exactly
what Tom is going to do at vacuuming - just update xmin/xmax to "1" in all items
(or setting some flag in t_infomask), - and change page' startup id to current.

I understand that this is not complete solution for xids problem, I just wasn't
going to solve it that time. Now after Tom' proposal I see how to reuse xids
without vacuuming (but having undo): we will add XidWrapId (XWI) - xid wrap
counter - to pages and set it when we change page. First time we do this for
page with old XWI we'll mark old items (to know later that they were changed
by xids with old XWI). Each time we change page we can mark old xmin/xmax
with xid <= current xid as committed long ago (basing on xact TTL restrinctions).

All above assumes that there will be no xids from aborted transactions in pages,
so we need not lookup in pg_log to know is a xid committed/aborted, - there will
be only xids from running or committed xactions there.

And we need in undo for this.

One simple way - start a new pg_log file at each wraparound and encode 
the high 4 bytes in the filename (or in first four bytes of file)

Do you mean that each _field_ will take more space, not each _record_ ?

The pg_log should be rotated anyway either with long xids or long-long
xids.

I suspect that we do on many platforms (like *BSD, Linux and Win32).

What platforms we currently support don't have functional gcc ?

And a (hopefully) small performance hit on operations when defined as

and some more for less data fitting in cache.

what operations do we need to be defined ?

I kind of like vadim's idea of segmenting pg_log. 

Segments in which all the xacts have been commited could be deleted.

Proposal:

Annotate each log file with the current XID value at the time the file 
is created.  Before comparing any two XIDs, subtract that value from 
each operand, using unsigned arithmetic. 

At a sustained rate of 10,000 transactions/second, any pair of 32-bit 
XIDs less than 2.5 days apart compare properly.

So, we'll have to abort some long running transaction.
And before after-wrap XIDs will be close to aborted xid you'd better
ensure that vacuum *successfully* run over all tables in database
(and shared tables) aborted transaction could touch.

Required frequency of *successful* vacuum over *all* tables.
We would have to remember something in pg_class/pg_database
and somehow force vacuum over "too-long-unvacuumed-tables"
*automatically*.

If undo would be implemented then we could delete pg_log between
postmaster startups - startup counter is remembered in pages, so
seeing old startup id in a page we would know that there are only
long ago committed xactions (ie only visible changes) there
and avoid xid comparison. But ... there will be no undo in 7.1.
And I foresee problems with WAL based BAR implementation if we'll
follow proposed solution: redo restores original xmin/xmax - how
to "freeze" xids while restoring DB?

(Sorry, I have to run away now... and have to think more about issue).

Without undo we have to ensure that all tables are vacuumed after
all transactions related to a segment were committed/aborted.

Are you sure of this, or is it just a 'last time I looked' statement. If
the latter, it might be worth verifying.

Yes, OIDs are used a lot, but it's not that bad, is it? Are there many
tight loops with thousands of OID-only operations? I'd guess it's only one
more instruction & memory fetch.

Maybe this can be achieved by wrapping XID for the log file only.

It's a cute idea (elegant, even), but maybe we'd be running through hoops
just for a minor performance gain (which may not exist, since we're adding
extra comparisons via the macro) and for possible unsupported OSs. Perhaps
OS's without 8 byte ints have to suffer a performance hit (ie. we declare a
struct with appropriate macros).

You mean you plan to limit PGSQL to only 1G concurrent transactions. Isn't
that a bit short sighted? ;-}

This is a problem for me; it seems to enshrine VACUUM in perpetuity.

Is there any was we can use this recycling technique with 8-byte XIDs?

Also, will there be a problem with backup programs that use XID to
determine newer records and apply/reapply changes?

Maybe I'm really missing the amount of XID manipulation, but I'd be
surprised if 16-byte XIDs would slow things down much.
