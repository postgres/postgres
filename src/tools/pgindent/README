This can format all PostgreSQL *.c and *.h files, excluding libpq++,
*.y, and *.l files.

On 09/06/1997, from the top directory, I ran:

  find . -name '*.[ch]' -type f -print | egrep -v '\+\+|s_lock.h' | xargs -n100 pgindent

The stock BSD indent has two bugs.  First, a comment after the word 'else' 
causes the rest of the file to be ignored.  Second, it silently ignores
typedefs after getting the first 100.

Both problems are worked-around in this script.  We also include a patch
for the second bug in:

	/src/tools/pgindent/indent.bsd.patch

Even with the workaround, installation of the patch produces better
output.

GNU indent, version 1.9.1, has several bugs, and is not recommended.
These bugs become pretty major when you are doing >200k lines of code.
If you don't believe me, take a directory and make a copy.  Run pgindent
on the copy using GNU indent, and do a diff -r. You will see what I
mean. GNU indent does some things better, but mangles too.

We get the list of typedef's included in pgindent by running:

	/src/tools/find_typedef

Make sure to do the pgsql/bin directory, and the src/interfaces/odbc
directory.  Merge the output of these and remove duplicates.
