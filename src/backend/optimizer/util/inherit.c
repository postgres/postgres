/*
 * expand_inherited_rtentry
 *		Expand a rangetable entry that has the "inh" bit set.
 *
 * "inh" is only allowed in two cases: RELATION and SUBQUERY RTEs.
 *
 * "inh" on a plain RELATION RTE means that it is a partitioned table or the
 * parent of a traditional-inheritance set.  In this case we must add entries
 * for all the interesting child tables to the query's rangetable, and build
 * additional planner data structures for them, including RelOptInfos,
 * AppendRelInfos, and possibly PlanRowMarks.
 *
 * Note that the original RTE is considered to represent the whole inheritance
 * set.  In the case of traditional inheritance, the first of the generated
 * RTEs is an RTE for the same table, but with inh = false, to represent the
 * parent table in its role as a simple member of the inheritance set.  For
 * partitioning, we don't need a second RTE because the partitioned table
 * itself has no data and need not be scanned.
 *
 * "inh" on a SUBQUERY RTE means that it's the parent of a UNION ALL group,
 * which is treated as an appendrel similarly to inheritance cases; however,
 * we already made RTEs and AppendRelInfos for the subqueries.  We only need
 * to build RelOptInfos for them, which is done by expand_appendrel_subquery.
