<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> statements can, intentionally or not, require
the mixing of different data types in the same expression.
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has extensive facilities for
evaluating mixed-type expressions.
</para>

<para>
In many cases a user does not need
to understand the details of the type conversion mechanism.
However, implicit conversions done by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
can affect the results of a query.  When necessary, these results
can be tailored by using <emphasis>explicit</emphasis> type conversion.
</para>

<para>
This chapter introduces the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
type conversion mechanisms and conventions.

operators.

<title>Overview</title>

<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> is a strongly typed language. That is, every data item
has an associated data type which determines its behavior and allowed usage.
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has an extensible type system that is
more general and flexible than other <acronym>SQL</acronym> implementations.
Hence, most type conversion behavior in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
is governed by general rules rather than by <foreignphrase>ad hoc</foreignphrase>
heuristics.  This allows the use of mixed-type expressions even with
user-defined types.
</para>

<para>
The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> scanner/parser divides lexical
elements into five fundamental categories: integers, non-integer numbers,
strings, identifiers, and key words.  Constants of most non-numeric types are
first classified as strings. The <acronym>SQL</acronym> language definition
allows specifying type names with strings, and this mechanism can be used in
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to start the parser down the correct
path. For example, the query:

<screen>
SELECT text 'Origin' AS "label", point '(0,0)' AS "value";

 label  | value
--------+-------
 Origin | (0,0)
(1 row)
</screen>

has two literal constants, of type <type>text</type> and <type>point</type>.
If a type is not specified for a string literal, then the placeholder type
<type>unknown</type> is assigned initially, to be resolved in later
stages as described below.
</para>

<para>
There are four fundamental <acronym>SQL</acronym> constructs requiring
distinct type conversion rules in the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
parser:

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Function calls
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Much of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> type system is built around a
rich set of functions. Functions can have one or more arguments.
Since <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> permits function
overloading, the function name alone does not uniquely identify the function
to be called; the parser must select the right function based on the data
types of the supplied arguments.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Operators
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows expressions with
prefix and postfix unary (one-argument) operators,
as well as binary (two-argument) operators.  Like functions, operators can
be overloaded, so the same problem of selecting the right operator
exists.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Value Storage
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<acronym>SQL</acronym> <command>INSERT</command> and <command>UPDATE</command> statements place the results of
expressions into a table. The expressions in the statement must be matched up
with, and perhaps converted to, the types of the target columns.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>UNION</literal>, <literal>CASE</literal>, and related constructs
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Since all query results from a unionized <command>SELECT</command> statement
must appear in a single set of columns, the types of the results of each
<command>SELECT</command> clause must be matched up and converted to a uniform set.
Similarly, the result expressions of a <literal>CASE</literal> construct must be
converted to a common type so that the <literal>CASE</literal> expression as a whole
has a known output type.  Some other constructs, such
as <literal>ARRAY[]</literal> and the <function>GREATEST</function>
and <function>LEAST</function> functions, likewise require determination of a
common type for several subexpressions.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
The system catalogs store information about which conversions, or
<firstterm>casts</firstterm>, exist between which data types, and how to
perform those conversions.  Additional casts can be added by the user
with the <xref linkend="sql-createcast"/>
command.  (This is usually
done in conjunction with defining new data types.  The set of casts
between built-in types has been carefully crafted and is best not
altered.)
</para>

<indexterm>
 <primary>data type</primary>
 <secondary>category</secondary>
</indexterm>

<para>
An additional heuristic provided by the parser allows improved determination
of the proper casting behavior among groups of types that have implicit casts.
Data types are divided into several basic <firstterm>type
categories</firstterm>, including <type>boolean</type>, <type>numeric</type>,
<type>string</type>, <type>bitstring</type>, <type>datetime</type>,
<type>timespan</type>, <type>geometric</type>, <type>network</type>, and
user-defined.  (For a list see <xref linkend="catalog-typcategory-table"/>;
but note it is also possible to create custom type categories.)  Within each
category there can be one or more <firstterm>preferred types</firstterm>, which
are preferred when there is a choice of possible types.  With careful selection
of preferred types and available implicit casts, it is possible to ensure that
ambiguous expressions (those with multiple candidate parsing solutions) can be
resolved in a useful way.
</para>

<para>
All type conversion rules are designed with several principles in mind:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Implicit conversions should never have surprising or unpredictable outcomes.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
There should be no extra overhead in the parser or executor
if a query does not need implicit type conversion.
That is, if a query is well-formed and the types already match, then the query should execute
without spending extra time in the parser and without introducing unnecessary implicit conversion
calls in the query.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Additionally, if a query usually requires an implicit conversion for a function, and
if then the user defines a new function with the correct argument types, the parser
should use this new function and no longer do implicit conversion to use the old function.

   The specific operator that is referenced by an operator expression

<example>
<title>Square Root Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
There is only one square root operator (prefix <literal>|/</literal>)
defined in the standard catalog, and it takes an argument of type
<type>double precision</type>.
The scanner assigns an initial type of <type>integer</type> to the argument
in this query expression:
<screen>
SELECT |/ 40 AS "square root of 40";
 square root of 40
-------------------
 6.324555320336759
(1 row)
</screen>

So the parser does a type conversion on the operand and the query
is equivalent to:

<screen>
SELECT |/ CAST(40 AS double precision) AS "square root of 40";
</screen>
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>String Concatenation Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
A string-like syntax is used for working with string types and for
working with complex extension types.
Strings with unspecified type are matched with likely operator candidates.
</para>

<para>
An example with one unspecified argument:
<screen>
SELECT text 'abc' || 'def' AS "text and unknown";

 text and unknown
------------------
 abcdef
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
In this case the parser looks to see if there is an operator taking <type>text</type>
for both arguments. Since there is, it assumes that the second argument should
be interpreted as type <type>text</type>.
</para>

<para>
Here is a concatenation of two values of unspecified types:
<screen>
SELECT 'abc' || 'def' AS "unspecified";

 unspecified
-------------
 abcdef
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
In this case there is no initial hint for which type to use, since no types
are specified in the query. So, the parser looks for all candidate operators
and finds that there are candidates accepting both string-category and
bit-string-category inputs.  Since string category is preferred when available,
that category is selected, and then the
preferred type for strings, <type>text</type>, is used as the specific
type to resolve the unknown-type literals as.
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>Absolute-Value and Negation Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> operator catalog has several
entries for the prefix operator <literal>@</literal>, all of which implement
absolute-value operations for various numeric data types.  One of these
entries is for type <type>float8</type>, which is the preferred type in
the numeric category.  Therefore, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
will use that entry when faced with an <type>unknown</type> input:
<screen>
SELECT @ '-4.5' AS "abs";
 abs
-----
 4.5
(1 row)
</screen>
Here the system has implicitly resolved the unknown-type literal as type
<type>float8</type> before applying the chosen operator.  We can verify that
<type>float8</type> and not some other type was used:
<screen>
SELECT @ '-4.5e500' AS "abs";

ERROR:  "-4.5e500" is out of range for type double precision
</screen>
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, the prefix operator <literal>~</literal> (bitwise negation)
is defined only for integer data types, not for <type>float8</type>.  So, if we
try a similar case with <literal>~</literal>, we get:
<screen>
SELECT ~ '20' AS "negation";

ERROR:  operator is not unique: ~ "unknown"
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You might need to add
explicit type casts.
</screen>
This happens because the system cannot decide which of the several
possible <literal>~</literal> operators should be preferred.  We can help
it out with an explicit cast:
<screen>
SELECT ~ CAST('20' AS int8) AS "negation";

 negation
----------
      -21
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>Array Inclusion Operator Type Resolution</title>

<para>
Here is another example of resolving an operator with one known and one
unknown input:
<screen>
SELECT array[1,2] &lt;@ '{1,2,3}' as "is subset";

 is subset
-----------
 t
(1 row)
</screen>
The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> operator catalog has several
entries for the infix operator <literal>&lt;@</literal>, but the only two that
could possibly accept an integer array on the left-hand side are
array inclusion (<type>anyarray</type> <literal>&lt;@</literal> <type>anyarray</type>)
and range inclusion (<type>anyelement</type> <literal>&lt;@</literal> <type>anyrange</type>).
Since none of these polymorphic pseudo-types (see <xref
linkend="datatype-pseudo"/>) are considered preferred, the parser cannot
resolve the ambiguity on that basis.
However, <xref linkend="op-resol-last-unknown"/> tells
it to assume that the unknown-type literal is of the same type as the other
input, that is, integer array.  Now only one of the two operators can match,
so array inclusion is selected.  (Had range inclusion been selected, we would
have gotten an error, because the string does not have the right format to be
a range literal.)
</para>
</example>

<example>
<title>Custom Operator on a Domain Type</title>

<para>
Users sometimes try to declare operators applying just to a domain type.
This is possible but is not nearly as useful as it might seem, because the
operator resolution rules are designed to select operators applying to the
domain's base type.  As an example consider
<screen>
CREATE DOMAIN mytext AS text CHECK(...);
CREATE FUNCTION mytext_eq_text (mytext, text) RETURNS boolean AS ...;
CREATE OPERATOR = (procedure=mytext_eq_text, leftarg=mytext, rightarg=text);
CREATE TABLE mytable (val mytext);

SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE val = 'foo';
</screen>
This query will not use the custom operator.  The parser will first see if
there is a <type>mytext</type> <literal>=</literal> <type>mytext</type> operator
(<xref linkend="op-resol-exact-unknown"/>), which there is not;
then it will consider the domain's base type <type>text</type>, and see if
there is a <type>text</type> <literal>=</literal> <type>text</type> operator
(<xref linkend="op-resol-exact-domain"/>), which there is;
so it resolves the <type>unknown</type>-type literal as <type>text</type> and
uses the <type>text</type> <literal>=</literal> <type>text</type> operator.
The only way to get the custom operator to be used is to explicitly cast
the literal:
<screen>
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE val = text 'foo';
</screen>
so that the <type>mytext</type> <literal>=</literal> <type>text</type> operator is found
immediately according to the exact-match rule.  If the best-match rules
are reached, they actively discriminate against operators on domain types.
If they did not, such an operator would create too many ambiguous-operator
failures, because the casting rules always consider a domain as castable
to or from its base type, and so the domain operator would be considered
usable in all the same cases as a similarly-named operator on the base type.

  LANGUAGE sql AS 'SELECT 1';
CREATE FUNCTION
</screen>

This function accepts, but does not require, the VARIADIC keyword.  It
tolerates both integer and numeric arguments:

<screen>
SELECT public.variadic_example(0),
       public.variadic_example(0.0),
       public.variadic_example(VARIADIC array[0.0]);
 variadic_example | variadic_example | variadic_example
------------------+------------------+------------------
                1 |                1 |                1
(1 row)
</screen>

However, the first and second calls will prefer more-specific functions, if
available:

<screen>
CREATE FUNCTION public.variadic_example(numeric) RETURNS int
  LANGUAGE sql AS 'SELECT 2';
CREATE FUNCTION

CREATE FUNCTION public.variadic_example(int) RETURNS int
  LANGUAGE sql AS 'SELECT 3';
CREATE FUNCTION

SELECT public.variadic_example(0),
       public.variadic_example(0.0),
       public.variadic_example(VARIADIC array[0.0]);
 variadic_example | variadic_example | variadic_example
------------------+------------------+------------------
                3 |                2 |                1
(1 row)
</screen>

Given the default configuration and only the first function existing, the
first and second calls are insecure.  Any user could intercept them by
creating the second or third function.  By matching the argument type exactly
and using the <literal>VARIADIC</literal> keyword, the third call is secure.

<title>Substring Function Type Resolution</title>

<para>
There are several <function>substr</function> functions, one of which
takes types <type>text</type> and <type>integer</type>.  If called
with a string constant of unspecified type, the system chooses the
candidate function that accepts an argument of the preferred category
<literal>string</literal> (namely of type <type>text</type>).

<screen>
SELECT substr('1234', 3);

 substr
--------
     34
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If the string is declared to be of type <type>varchar</type>, as might be the case
if it comes from a table, then the parser will try to convert it to become <type>text</type>:
<screen>
SELECT substr(varchar '1234', 3);

 substr
--------
     34
(1 row)
</screen>

This is transformed by the parser to effectively become:
<screen>
SELECT substr(CAST (varchar '1234' AS text), 3);
</screen>
</para>
<para>
<note>
<para>
The parser learns from the <structname>pg_cast</structname> catalog that
<type>text</type> and <type>varchar</type>
are binary-compatible, meaning that one can be passed to a function that
accepts the other without doing any physical conversion.  Therefore, no
type conversion call is really inserted in this case.
</para>
</note>
</para>

<para>
And, if the function is called with an argument of type <type>integer</type>,
the parser will try to convert that to <type>text</type>:
<screen>
SELECT substr(1234, 3);
ERROR:  function substr(integer, integer) does not exist
HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need
to add explicit type casts.
</screen>

This does not work because <type>integer</type> does not have an implicit cast
to <type>text</type>.  An explicit cast will work, however:
<screen>
SELECT substr(CAST (1234 AS text), 3);

 substr
--------
     34

   Values to be inserted into a table are converted to the destination

   following steps.

<title>Value Storage Type Conversion</title>

<step performance="required">
<para>
Check for an exact match with the target.
</para>
</step>

<step performance="required">
<para>
Otherwise, try to convert the expression to the target type.  This is possible
if an <firstterm>assignment cast</firstterm> between the two types is registered in the
<structname>pg_cast</structname> catalog (see <xref linkend="sql-createcast"/>).
Alternatively, if the expression is an unknown-type literal, the contents of
the literal string will be fed to the input conversion routine for the target
type.
</para>
</step>

<step performance="required">
<para>
Check to see if there is a sizing cast for the target type.  A sizing
cast is a cast from that type to itself.  If one is found in the
<structname>pg_cast</structname> catalog, apply it to the expression before storing
into the destination column.  The implementation function for such a cast
always takes an extra parameter of type <type>integer</type>, which receives
the destination column's <structfield>atttypmod</structfield> value (typically its
declared length, although the interpretation of <structfield>atttypmod</structfield>
varies for different data types), and it may take a third <type>boolean</type>
parameter that says whether the cast is explicit or implicit.  The cast
function
is responsible for applying any length-dependent semantics such as size
checking or truncation.
</para>
</step>

</procedure>

<example>
<title><type>character</type> Storage Type Conversion</title>

<para>
For a target column declared as <type>character(20)</type> the following
statement shows that the stored value is sized correctly:

<screen>
CREATE TABLE vv (v character(20));
INSERT INTO vv SELECT 'abc' || 'def';
SELECT v, octet_length(v) FROM vv;

          v           | octet_length
----------------------+--------------
 abcdef               |           20
(1 row)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
What has really happened here is that the two unknown literals are resolved
to <type>text</type> by default, allowing the <literal>||</literal> operator
to be resolved as <type>text</type> concatenation.  Then the <type>text</type>
result of the operator is converted to <type>bpchar</type> (<quote>blank-padded
char</quote>, the internal name of the <type>character</type> data type) to match the target
column type.  (Since the conversion from <type>text</type> to
<type>bpchar</type> is binary-coercible, this conversion does
not insert any real function call.)  Finally, the sizing function
<literal>bpchar(bpchar, integer, boolean)</literal> is found in the system catalog
and applied to the operator's result and the stored column length.  This
type-specific function performs the required length check and addition of
padding spaces.

<para>
SQL <literal>UNION</literal> constructs must match up possibly dissimilar
types to become a single result set.  The resolution algorithm is
applied separately to each output column of a union query.  The
<literal>INTERSECT</literal> and <literal>EXCEPT</literal> constructs resolve
dissimilar types in the same way as <literal>UNION</literal>.
Some other constructs, including
<literal>CASE</literal>, <literal>ARRAY</literal>, <literal>VALUES</literal>,
and the <function>GREATEST</function> and <function>LEAST</function>
functions, use the identical
algorithm to match up their component expressions and select a result

Here, since type <type>real</type> cannot be implicitly cast to <type>integer</type>,

<title>Type Resolution in a Nested Union</title>

SELECT NULL UNION SELECT NULL UNION SELECT 1;

ERROR:  UNION types text and integer cannot be matched

This failure occurs because <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> treats
multiple <literal>UNION</literal>s as a nest of pairwise operations;
that is, this input is the same as
<screen>
(SELECT NULL UNION SELECT NULL) UNION SELECT 1;

The inner <literal>UNION</literal> is resolved as emitting
type <type>text</type>, according to the rules given above.  Then the
outer <literal>UNION</literal> has inputs of types <type>text</type>
and <type>integer</type>, leading to the observed error.  The problem
can be fixed by ensuring that the leftmost <literal>UNION</literal>
has at least one input of the desired result type.

likewise resolved pairwise.  However, the other constructs described in this

The rules given in the preceding sections will result in assignment
of non-<type>unknown</type> data types to all expressions in a SQL query,
except for unspecified-type literals that appear as simple output
columns of a <command>SELECT</command> command.  For example, in

<screen>
SELECT 'Hello World';
</screen>

there is nothing to identify what type the string literal should be
taken as.  In this situation <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> will fall back
to resolving the literal's type as <type>text</type>.
</para>

<para>
When the <command>SELECT</command> is one arm of a <literal>UNION</literal>
(or <literal>INTERSECT</literal> or <literal>EXCEPT</literal>) construct, or when it
appears within <command>INSERT ... SELECT</command>, this rule is not applied
since rules given in preceding sections take precedence.  The type of an
unspecified-type literal can be taken from the other <literal>UNION</literal> arm
in the first case, or from the destination column in the second case.

 <para>
  Prior to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 10, this rule did not exist, and
