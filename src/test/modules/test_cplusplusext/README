test_cplusplusext - Test C++ Extension Compatibility
====================================================

This test module verifies that PostgreSQL headers and macros work
correctly when compiled with a C++ compiler.

While PostgreSQL already tests that headers are syntactically valid
C++ using headerscheck, the macros defined in those headers might
still expand to invalid C++ code.  This module catches such issues by
actually compiling and running an extension that's written in C++.
