   <title>What's In This Book</title>

   <para>
    This book covers topics that are of interest to a
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> database administrator.  This includes
    installation of the software, set up and configuration of the
    server, management of users and databases, and maintenance tasks.
    Anyone who runs a <productname>PostgreSQL</> server, either for
    personal use, but especially in production, should be familiar
    with the topics covered in this book.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information in this book is arranged approximately in the
    order in which a new user should read it.  But the chapters are
    self-contained and can be read individually as desired.  The
    information in this book is presented in a narrative fashion in
    topical units.  Readers looking for a complete description of a
    particular command should look into the &cite-reference;.
   </para>

   <para>
    The first few chapters are written so that they can be understood
    without prerequisite knowledge, so that new users who need to set
    up their own server can begin their exploration with this book.
    The rest of this book which is about tuning and management
    presupposes that the reader is familiar with the general use of
    the <productname>PostgreSQL</> database system.  Readers are
    encouraged to look at the &cite-tutorial; and the &cite-user; for
    additional information.
   </para>

   <para>
    This book covers <productname>PostgreSQL &version;</productname>
    only.  For information on other versions, please read the
    documentation that accompanies that release.
