 *
 * slru.c
 *		Simple LRU buffering for transaction status logfiles
 *
 * We use a simple least-recently-used scheme to manage a pool of page
 * buffers.  Under ordinary circumstances we expect that write
 * traffic will occur mostly to the latest page (and to the just-prior
 * page, soon after a page transition).  Read traffic will probably touch
 * a larger span of pages, but in any case a fairly small number of page
 * buffers should be sufficient.  So, we just search the buffers using plain
 * linear search; there's no need for a hashtable or anything fancy.
 * The management algorithm is straight LRU except that we will never swap
 * out the latest page (since we know it's going to be hit again eventually).
 *
 * We use a control LWLock to protect the shared data structures, plus
 * per-buffer LWLocks that synchronize I/O for each buffer.  The control lock
 * must be held to examine or modify any shared state.	A process that is
 * reading in or writing out a page buffer does not hold the control lock,
 * only the per-buffer lock for the buffer it is working on.
 *
 * "Holding the control lock" means exclusive lock in all cases except for
 * SimpleLruReadPage_ReadOnly(); see comments for SlruRecentlyUsed() for
 * the implications of that.
 *
 * When initiating I/O on a buffer, we acquire the per-buffer lock exclusively
 * before releasing the control lock.  The per-buffer lock is released after
 * completing the I/O, re-acquiring the control lock, and updating the shared
 * state.  (Deadlock is not possible here, because we never try to initiate
 * I/O when someone else is already doing I/O on the same buffer.)
 * To wait for I/O to complete, release the control lock, acquire the
 * per-buffer lock in shared mode, immediately release the per-buffer lock,
 * reacquire the control lock, and then recheck state (since arbitrary things
 * could have happened while we didn't have the lock).
 *
 * As with the regular buffer manager, it is possible for another process
 * to re-dirty a page that is currently being written out.	This is handled
 * by re-setting the page's page_dirty flag.

 * page numbering also wraps around at 0xFFFFFFFF/xxxx_XACTS_PER_PAGE (where

 * take no explicit notice of that fact in this module, except when comparing
 * segment and page numbers in SimpleLruTruncate (see PagePrecedes()).

 * Note: this file currently assumes that segment file names will be four

 * pages' counts will "wrap around" and make them appear recently used.
 *
 * We allow this code to be executed concurrently by multiple processes within
 * SimpleLruReadPage_ReadOnly().  As long as int reads and writes are atomic,
 * this should not cause any completely-bogus values to enter the computation.
 * However, it is possible for either cur_lru_count or individual
 * page_lru_count entries to be "reset" to lower values than they should have,
 * in case a process is delayed while it executes this macro.  With care in
 * SlruSelectLRUPage(), this does little harm, and in any case the absolute
