   If you haven't gotten the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution,
   get it from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.postgresql.org">ftp.postgresql.org</ulink>,
   then unpack it:

   <programlisting>
&gt; gunzip postgresql-7.0.tar.gz
&gt; tar -xf postgresql-7.0.tar

   <title>Before you start</title>

   <para>
    Building <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> requires <acronym>GNU</acronym>
    <application>make</application>.  It will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    work with other <application>make</application> programs. On GNU/Linux systems
    GNU make is the default tool, on other systems you may find that
    GNU <application>make</application> is installed under the name
    <literal>gmake</literal>.
    We will use that name from now on to indicate <acronym>GNU</acronym>
    <application>make</application>, no matter what name it has on your system.
    To test for <acronym>GNU</acronym> <application>make</application> enter
    <programlisting>
&gt; <userinput>gmake --version</userinput>
    </programlisting>
    If you need to get <acronym>GNU</acronym>
    <application>make</application>, you can
    find it at <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org">ftp://ftp.gnu.org</ulink>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Up to date information on supported platforms is at
    <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/ports.htm">
     http://www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/ports.htm</ulink>.
    In general, most Unix-compatible platforms with modern libraries
    should be able to run
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. In the
    <filename>doc</filename> subdirectory
    of the distribution are several platform-specific FAQ and README documents you
    might wish to consult if you are having trouble.
   </para>

   <para>
    Although the minimum required memory for running
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 
    can be as little as 8MB, there are noticeable speed improvements
    when expanding memory
    up to 96MB or beyond. The rule is you can never have too much memory.
   </para>
   <para>
    Check that you have sufficient disk space.  You will need about
    30 Mbytes for the source tree during compilation and about 5 Mbytes for
    the installation directory. An empty database takes about 1 Mbyte, otherwise
    they take about five times the amount of space that a flat text file with the
    same data would take. If you run the regression tests you will temporarily need
    an extra 20MB.
   </para>

   <para>
    To check for disk space, use 
<programlisting>
&gt; df -k
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Considering today's prices for hard disks, getting a large and
    fast hard disk should
    probably be in your plans before putting a database into production use.

     <para>
      Create the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> superuser account.
      This is the user the server will run as. For production use you
      should create a separate, unprivileged account
      (<literal>postgres</literal> is commonly used).
      If you do not have root access or just want to play around,
      your own user account is enough.
     </para>
     <para>
      Running <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> as
      <literal>root</literal>, <literal>bin</literal>,
      or any other account with special access rights is a security risk;
      <emphasis>don't do it</emphasis>.  The postmaster will in fact refuse
      to start as <literal>root</literal>.
     </para>
     <para>
      You need not do the building and installation itself under this account
      (although you can). You will be told when you need to login as the
      database superuser.

      Configure the source code for your system.  It is this step at which
      you can specify your actual installation path for the build process
      and make choices about what gets installed. Change into the
      <filename>src</filename>
      subdirectory and type:
      <programlisting>
&gt; ./configure
      </programlisting>
      followed by any options you might want to give it. For a first installation
      you should be able to do fine without any.
      For a complete list of options, type:
      <programlisting>
&gt; ./configure --help

	  Builds the Perl interface and plperl extension language.
	  Please note that the Perl interface needs to be
	  installed into the usual place for Perl modules (typically under
	  <filename>/usr/lib/perl</filename>), so you must have root access
	  to perform the installation step.  (It is often easiest to leave out

      If you want to test the newly built server before you install it,
      you can run the regression tests at this point.  The regression tests
      are a test suite to verify that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      runs on your machine in the way the developers expected it to.
      For detailed instructions see <xref endterm="regress-title"
       linkend="regress">.

      method only works with an already-installed server.)

      You now need to back up your existing database.
      To dump your fairly recent post-6.0 database installation, type
      <programlisting>
&gt; pg_dumpall > db.out
      </programlisting>
      If you wish to preserve object id's (oids), then use the -o
      option when running <application>pg_dumpall</application>.  
      However, unless you have a
      special reason for doing this (such as using OIDs as keys
      in tables), don't do it.
     </para>

     <para>
      Make sure to use the <application>pg_dumpall</application>
      command from the version you are currently running.
      7.0's <application>pg_dumpall</application> will not work on older databases.
      However, if you are still using 6.0, do not use the
      <application>pg_dumpall</application> script from 6.0 or everything will be
      owned by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> superuser after you
      reload. In that case
      you should grab <application>pg_dumpall</application> from a later
      6.x.x release.
      If you are upgrading from a version prior to
      <productname>Postgres95</productname> v1.09 then you must back
      up your database,
      install <productname>Postgres95</productname> v1.09, restore your database,
      then back it up again.
     </para>

     <caution>
      <para>
       You must make sure that your database is not updated in the middle of
       your backup.  If necessary, bring down postmaster, edit the permissions
       in file <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</filename>
       to allow only you on, then
       bring <application>postmaster</application> back up.

      If you are upgrading an existing system then kill the database
      server now. Type
      <programlisting>

      or
      <programlisting>
&gt; ps -e | grep postmaster

      (It depends on your system which one of these two works. No harm can be done
      by typing the wrong one.)
      This should list the process numbers for a number of processes, similar
      to this:

  263  ?  SW   0:00 (postmaster)
  777  p1 S    0:00 grep postmaster

      Type the following line, with <replaceable>pid</replaceable>
      replaced by the process id for process <literal>postmaster</literal>
      (263 in the above case). (Do not use the id for the process

       On systems which have <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
       started at boot time, there
       is probably a startup file that will accomplish the same

       Redhat Linux system one might find that
       <programlisting>
&gt; /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres.init stop
       </programlisting>
       works.
      </para>

      Also move the old directories  out of the way. Type the following:

      If necessary, tell your system how to find the new shared libraries.
      How to do this varies between platforms. The most widely usable method
      is to set the environment variable
      <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>:
      <programlisting>
&gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
&gt; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

      <programlisting>
&gt; setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib
      </programlisting>
      on csh or tcsh.
      You might want to put this into a shell startup file such as
      <filename>/etc/profile</filename>.
     </para>

     <para>
      On some systems the following is the preferred method, but you must have root
      access. Edit file <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> to add a line
      <programlisting>
<filename>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</filename>
      </programlisting>
      Then run command <command>/sbin/ldconfig</command>.
     </para>

     <para>
      If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system. If you later on get
      a message like
      <programlisting>
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
      </programlisting>

      Create the database installation (the working data files).
      To do this you must log in to your
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> superuser account. It will not
      work as root.
      <programlisting>
&gt; mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data

      The <option>-D</option> option specifies the location where the data will be
      stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have to be under
      the installation directory. Just make sure that the superuser account
      can write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already exist)
      before starting <command>initdb</command>.
      (If you have already been doing the installation up to now as the
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>

      The previous step should have told you how to start up the database server.
      Do so now.  The command should look something like
      <programlisting>
&gt; /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
      </programlisting>
      This will start the server in the foreground. To make it detach to
      the background, you can use the <option>-S</option> option, but then you won't
      see any log messages the server produces.  A better way to put the server
      in the background is
      <programlisting>
&gt; nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \

      Life will be more convenient if you set up some environment
      variables. First of all
      you probably want to include
      <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</filename> (or equivalent)
      into your <envar>PATH</envar>. To do this, add the following to
      your shell startup
      file, such as <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> (or
      <filename>/etc/profile</filename>, 
      if you want it to affect every user):
      <programlisting>
&gt; PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin
      </programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
      Furthermore, if you set <envar>PGDATA</envar> in the environment
      of the PostgreSQL
      superuser, you can omit the <option>-D</option> for
      <filename>postmaster</filename> 
      and <filename>initdb</filename>.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You probably want to install the <application>man</application> and
      <acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation. Type
      <programlisting>
&gt; cd /usr/src/pgsql/postgresql-7.0/doc
&gt; gmake install
      </programlisting>
      This will install files under <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/doc</filename>
      and <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/man</filename>. To enable your system
      to find the <application>man</application> documentation, you need to
      add a line like the following to a shell startup file:

&gt; MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/pgsql/man

     </para>

     <para>
      The documentation is also available in Postscript format. If you have
      a Postscript printer, or have your machine already set up to accept
      Postscript files using a print filter, then to print the User's Guide
      simply type
      <programlisting>
&gt; cd /usr/local/pgsql/doc
&gt; gunzip -c user.ps.tz | lpr

      The Adminstrator's Guide should probably be your first reading if you

      Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will automatically
      start the database server whenever it boots.
      This is not required; the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server can
      be run successfully from non-privileged accounts without root intervention.

     <para>
      Different systems have different conventions for starting up
      daemons at boot time,
      so you are advised to familiarize yourself with them.
      Most systems have a file <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
      <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename> which is almost
      certainly no bad place
      to put such a command.
      Whatever you do, postmaster must be run by the
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 
      superuser (<literal>postgres</literal>) <emphasis>and not by
       root</emphasis> or
      any other user. Therefore you probably always want to form your command lines
      along the lines of <literal>su -c '...' postgres</literal>.
     </para>

      It might be advisable to keep a log of the server output. To
      start the server that way
      try:

	 Edit file rc.local on NetBSD or file rc2.d on SPARC Solaris
	 2.5.1 to contain the following single line:

	 You may put the line breaks as shown above.  The shell is smart
	 enough to keep parsing beyond end-of-line if there is an
