pgindent
========

This can format all PostgreSQL *.c and *.h files, but excludes *.y, and
*.l files.

1) Install pg_bsd_indent (see below for details).

2) Install entab (src/tools/entab/).

3) Change directory to the top of the build tree.

4) Remove all derived files (pgindent has trouble with one of the flex macros):

	make maintainer-clean

   Or:

	git clean -fdx

5) Download the typedef file from the buildfarm:

	wget -O src/tools/pgindent/typedefs.list http://buildfarm.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/typedefs.pl

   (see http://www.pgbuildfarm.org/cgi-bin/typedefs.pl?show_list for a full list of typedefs,
    also http://adpgtech.blogspot.com/2015/05/running-pgindent-on-non-core-code-or.html)

6) Run pgindent:

	src/tools/pgindent/pgindent

7) Remove any files that generate errors and restore their original
   versions.

8) Indent the Perl code:

	(
		find . -name \*.pl -o -name \*.pm

		find . -type f -exec file {} \; |
		egrep -i ':.*perl[0-9]*\>' |
		cut -d: -f1
	) |
	sort -u |
	xargs perltidy --profile=src/tools/pgindent/perltidyrc

9) Do a full test build:

	> run configure
	# stop is only necessary if it's going to install in a location with an
	# already running server
	pg_ctl stop
	run configure
	make -C src install
	make -C contrib install
	run initdb
	pg_ctl start
	make installcheck-world

10) Remove Perl backup files after testing (*.bak)

BSD indent
----------

We have standardized on NetBSD's indent, and renamed it pg_bsd_indent.
We have fixed a few bugs which requre the NetBSD source to be patched
with indent.bsd.patch patch.  A fully patched version is available at
ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/dev.

GNU indent, version 2.2.6, has several problems, and is not recommended.
These bugs become pretty major when you are doing >500k lines of code.
If you don't believe me, take a directory and make a copy.  Run pgindent
on the copy using GNU indent, and do a diff -r. You will see what I
mean. GNU indent does some things better, but mangles too.  For details,
see:

	http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2003-10/msg00374.php
	http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2011-04/msg01436.php

Notes about excluded files
--------------------------

src/include/storage/s_lock.h and src/include/port/atomics/ are excluded
because they contain assembly code that pgindent tends to mess up.

src/include/snowball/libstemmer/ and src/backend/snowball/libstemmer/
are excluded because those files are imported from an external project,
not maintained locally, and are machine-generated anyway.

src/interfaces/ecpg/test/expected/ is excluded to avoid breaking the ecpg
regression tests.  Several *.h files are included in regression output so
should not be changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obsolete typedef list creation instructions
-------------------------------------------

To use pgindent:

1) Build the source tree with _debug_ symbols and all possible configure options

2) Install to /usr/local/pgsql

3) Install all contrib modules

4) Save a list of typedefs by running:

	src/tools/find_typedef /usr/local/pgsql/bin /usr/local/pgsql/lib > /tmp/pgtypedefs
