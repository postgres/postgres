 *
 * PARALLELISM
 *
 * Hash joins can participate in parallel query execution in several ways.  A
 * parallel-oblivious hash join is one where the node is unaware that it is
 * part of a parallel plan.  In this case, a copy of the inner plan is used to
 * build a copy of the hash table in every backend, and the outer plan could
 * either be built from a partial or complete path, so that the results of the
 * hash join are correspondingly either partial or complete.  A parallel-aware
 * hash join is one that behaves differently, coordinating work between
 * backends, and appears as Parallel Hash Join in EXPLAIN output.  A Parallel
 * Hash Join always appears with a Parallel Hash node.
 *
 * Parallel-aware hash joins use the same per-backend state machine to track
 * progress through the hash join algorithm as parallel-oblivious hash joins.
 * In a parallel-aware hash join, there is also a shared state machine that
 * co-operating backends use to synchronize their local state machines and
 * program counters.  The shared state machine is managed with a Barrier IPC
 * primitive.  When all attached participants arrive at a barrier, the phase
 * advances and all waiting participants are released.
 *
 * When a participant begins working on a parallel hash join, it must first
 * figure out how much progress has already been made, because participants
 * don't wait for each other to begin.  For this reason there are switch
 * statements at key points in the code where we have to synchronize our local
 * state machine with the phase, and then jump to the correct part of the
 * algorithm so that we can get started.
 *
 * One barrier called build_barrier is used to coordinate the hashing phases.
 * The phase is represented by an integer which begins at zero and increments
 * one by one, but in the code it is referred to by symbolic names as follows:
 *
 *   PHJ_BUILD_ELECTING              -- initial state
 *   PHJ_BUILD_ALLOCATING            -- one sets up the batches and table 0
 *   PHJ_BUILD_HASHING_INNER         -- all hash the inner rel
 *   PHJ_BUILD_HASHING_OUTER         -- (multi-batch only) all hash the outer
 *   PHJ_BUILD_DONE                  -- building done, probing can begin
 *
 * While in the phase PHJ_BUILD_HASHING_INNER a separate pair of barriers may
 * be used repeatedly as required to coordinate expansions in the number of
 * batches or buckets.  Their phases are as follows:
 *
 *   PHJ_GROW_BATCHES_ELECTING       -- initial state
 *   PHJ_GROW_BATCHES_ALLOCATING     -- one allocates new batches
 *   PHJ_GROW_BATCHES_REPARTITIONING -- all repartition
 *   PHJ_GROW_BATCHES_FINISHING      -- one cleans up, detects skew
 *
 *   PHJ_GROW_BUCKETS_ELECTING       -- initial state
 *   PHJ_GROW_BUCKETS_ALLOCATING     -- one allocates new buckets
 *   PHJ_GROW_BUCKETS_REINSERTING    -- all insert tuples
 *
 * If the planner got the number of batches and buckets right, those won't be
 * necessary, but on the other hand we might finish up needing to expand the
 * buckets or batches multiple times while hashing the inner relation to stay
 * within our memory budget and load factor target.  For that reason it's a
 * separate pair of barriers using circular phases.
 *
 * The PHJ_BUILD_HASHING_OUTER phase is required only for multi-batch joins,
 * because we need to divide the outer relation into batches up front in order
 * to be able to process batches entirely independently.  In contrast, the
 * parallel-oblivious algorithm simply throws tuples 'forward' to 'later'
 * batches whenever it encounters them while scanning and probing, which it
 * can do because it processes batches in serial order.
 *
 * Once PHJ_BUILD_DONE is reached, backends then split up and process
 * different batches, or gang up and work together on probing batches if there
 * aren't enough to go around.  For each batch there is a separate barrier
 * with the following phases:
 *
 *  PHJ_BATCH_ELECTING       -- initial state
 *  PHJ_BATCH_ALLOCATING     -- one allocates buckets
 *  PHJ_BATCH_LOADING        -- all load the hash table from disk
 *  PHJ_BATCH_PROBING        -- all probe
 *  PHJ_BATCH_DONE           -- end
 *
 * Batch 0 is a special case, because it starts out in phase
 * PHJ_BATCH_PROBING; populating batch 0's hash table is done during
 * PHJ_BUILD_HASHING_INNER so we can skip loading.
 *
 * Initially we try to plan for a single-batch hash join using the combined
 * hash_mem of all participants to create a large shared hash table.  If that
 * turns out either at planning or execution time to be impossible then we
 * fall back to regular hash_mem sized hash tables.
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, we never wait for any barrier unless it is known that
 * all other backends attached to it are actively executing the node or have
 * already arrived.  Practically, that means that we never return a tuple
 * while attached to a barrier, unless the barrier has reached its final
 * state.  In the slightly special case of the per-batch barrier, we return
 * tuples while in PHJ_BATCH_PROBING phase, but that's OK because we use
 * BarrierArriveAndDetach() to advance it to PHJ_BATCH_DONE without waiting.
