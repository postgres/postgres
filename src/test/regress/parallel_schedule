# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.
test: tablespace

# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# strings depends on char, varchar and text
# numerology depends on int2, int4, int8, float4, float8
# ----------
test: strings numerology point lseg line box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval inet macaddr macaddr8 tstypes xid

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz
# ----------
test: geometry horology regex oidjoins type_sanity opr_sanity misc_sanity comments expressions unicode

# ----------
# These four each depend on the previous one
# ----------
test: create_function_1
test: create_type
test: create_table
test: create_function_2

# ----------
# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.
# ----------
test: copy copyselect copydml insert insert_conflict

# ----------
# More groups of parallel tests
# ----------
test: create_misc create_operator create_procedure
# These depend on create_misc and create_operator

# ----------
test: create_aggregate create_function_3 create_cast constraints triggers select inherit typed_table vacuum drop_if_exists updatable_views roleattributes create_am hash_func errors

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.
# ----------
test: sanity_check

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# Note: the ignore: line does not run random, just mark it as ignorable
# ----------

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# NB: temp.sql does a reconnect which transiently uses 2 connections,
# so keep this parallel group to at most 19 tests
# ----------
test: plancache limit plpgsql copy2 temp domain rangefuncs prepare conversion truncate alter_table sequence polymorphism rowtypes returning largeobject with xml
