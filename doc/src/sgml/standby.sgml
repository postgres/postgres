  <literal>pg_standby</literal> is a production-ready program that can be used 
  to create a Warm Standby server. Other configuration is required as well, 
  all of which is described in the main server manual.
 </para>
 <para>
  The program is designed to be a wait-for <literal>restore_command</literal>, 
  required to turn a normal archive recovery into a Warm Standby. Within the 
  <literal>restore_command</literal> of the <literal>recovery.conf</literal> 
  you could configure <literal>pg_standby</literal> in the following way:
 </para>
 <programlisting>
   restore_command = 'pg_standby archiveDir %f %p'
 </programlisting>
 <para>
  which would be sufficient to define that files will be restored from 
  archiveDir.

  <title>Usage</title>
  <para>
   <literal>pg_standby</literal> should be used within the 
   <literal>restore_command</literal> of the <literal>recovery.conf</literal>
   file. 
  </para>
  <para>
   The basic usage should be like this:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
   restore_command = 'pg_standby archiveDir %f %p'
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   with the pg_standby command usage as
  </para>
  <programlisting>
   pg_standby [OPTION]... [ARCHIVELOCATION] [NEXTWALFILE] [XLOGFILEPATH]
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   When used within the <literal>restore_command</literal> the %f and %p macros
   will provide the actual file and path required for the restore/recovery.
  </para>

        You should be wary against setting this number too low,
        since this may mean you cannot restart the standby. This
        is because the last restartpoint marked in the WAL files
        may be many files in the past and can vary considerably.
        This should be set to a value exceeding the number of WAL
        files that can be recovered in 2*checkpoint_timeout seconds,
        according to the value in the warm standby postgresql.conf.
        It is wholly unrelated to the setting of checkpoint_segments
        on either primary or standby.
       </para>
       <para>
        If in doubt, use a large value or do not set a value at all.

       <para>
        Link is more efficient, but the default is copy to 
        allow you to maintain the WAL archive for recovery
        purposes as well as high-availability.

        This option uses the Windows Vista command mklink
        to provide a file-to-file symbolic link. -l will
        not work on versions of Windows prior to Vista.
        Use the -c option instead.

        the maximum number of times to retry the restore command if it
        fails. After each failure, we wait for sleeptime * num_retries
        so that the wait time increases progressively, so by default
        we will wait 5 secs, 10 secs then 15 secs before reporting
        the failure back to the database server. This will be
        interpreted as and end of recovery and the Standby will come
        up fully as a result. <literal>Default=3</literal>

       the number of seconds to sleep between testing to see
       if the file to be restored is available in the archive yet.

       consult the main database server manual for discussion.

       the presence of the triggerfile will cause recovery to end
       whether or not the next file is available
       It is recommended that you use a structured filename to 
       avoid confusion as to which server is being triggered
       when multiple servers exist on same system.
       e.g. /tmp/pgsql.trigger.5432
