 *
 * latch.c
 *	  Routines for inter-process latches
 *
 * The Unix implementation uses the so-called self-pipe trick to overcome the
 * race condition involved with poll() (or epoll_wait() on linux) and setting
 * a global flag in the signal handler. When a latch is set and the current
 * process is waiting for it, the signal handler wakes up the poll() in
 * WaitLatch by writing a byte to a pipe. A signal by itself doesn't interrupt
 * poll() on all platforms, and even on platforms where it does, a signal that
 * arrives just before the poll() call does not prevent poll() from entering
 * sleep. An incoming byte on a pipe however reliably interrupts the sleep,
 * and causes poll() to return immediately even if the signal arrives before
 * poll() begins.
 *
 * When SetLatch is called from the same process that owns the latch,
 * SetLatch writes the byte directly to the pipe. If it's owned by another
 * process, SIGUSR1 is sent and the signal handler in the waiting process
 * writes the byte to the pipe on behalf of the signaling process.
 *
 * The Windows implementation uses Windows events that are inherited by all
 * postmaster child processes. There's no need for the self-pipe trick there.
