## currently, this script makes a lot of assumptions:
## in postgresql.conf.sample:
##   1) the valid config settings may be preceded by a '#', but NOT '# '
##      (we use this to skip comments)
##   2) the valid config settings will be followed immediately by  ' =' 
##      (at least one space preceding the '=')
## in guc.c:
##   3) the options have PGC_ on the same line as the option
##   4) the options have '{' on the same line as the option

##  Problems
## 1) Don't know what to do with TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL

## if an option is valid but shows up in only one file (guc.c but not
## postgresql.conf.sample), it should be listed here so that it 
## can be ignored
