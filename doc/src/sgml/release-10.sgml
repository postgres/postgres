     <para>
      Change the implementation of set-returning functions appearing in
      a query's <literal>SELECT</> list (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      Set-returning functions are now evaluated before evaluation of scalar
      expressions in the <literal>SELECT</> list, much as though they had
      been placed in a <literal>LATERAL FROM</>-clause item.  This allows
      saner semantics for cases where multiple set-returning functions are
      present.  If they return different numbers of rows, the shorter results
      are extended to match the longest result by adding nulls.  Previously
      the results were cycled until they all terminated at the same time,
      producing a number of rows equal to the least common multiple of the
      functions' periods.  In addition, set-returning functions are now
      disallowed within <literal>CASE</> and <literal>COALESCE</> constructs.

     <para>
      A sequence relation now stores only the fields that can be modified

      is <structfield>last_value</>, <structfield>log_cnt</>,
      and <structfield>is_called</>.  Other sequence properties, such as
      the starting value and increment, are kept in a corresponding row of
      the <structname>pg_sequence</> catalog.
      <command>ALTER SEQUENCE</> updates are now fully transactional,
      implying that the sequence is locked until commit.
      The <function>nextval()</> and <function>setval()</> functions
      remain nontransactional.
     </para>

     <para>
      The main incompatibility introduced by this change is that selecting
      from a sequence relation now returns only the three fields named
      above.  To obtain the sequence's other properties, applications must
      look into <structname>pg_sequence</>.  The new system
      view <link linkend="view-pg-sequences"><structname>pg_sequences</></>
      can also be used for this purpose; it provides column names that are
      more compatible with existing code.

     <para>
      In previous releases, a logical replication connection required

      of this release, logical replication matches a normal entry with a
      database name or keywords such as <literal>all</literal>.  Physical
      replication continues to use the <literal>replication</literal> keyword.
      Since built-in logical replication is new in this release, this

    </para>

    <para>
     This feature requires a backwards-incompatible change to the handling
     of arrays of composite types in PL/Python.  Previously, you could
     return an array of composite values by writing, e.g., <literal>[[col1,
     col2], [col1, col2]]</>; but now that is interpreted as a
     two-dimensional array.  Composite types in arrays must now be written
     as Python tuples, not lists, to resolve the ambiguity; that is,
     write <literal>[(col1, col2), (col1, col2)]</> instead.

      Increase the size of the default DH parameters used for OpenSSL
      ephemeral DH ciphers to 2048 bits (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      The size of the compiled-in DH parameters has been increased from
      1024 to 2048 bits, making DH key exchange more resistant to
      brute-force attacks.  However, some old SSL implementations, notably
      some revisions of Java Runtime Environment version 6, will not accept
      DH parameters longer than 1024 bits, and hence will not be able to
      connect over SSL.  If it's necessary to support such old clients, you
      can use custom 1024-bit DH parameters instead of the compiled-in
      defaults.  See <xref linkend="guc-ssl-dh-params-file">.

       (Nikita Glukhov)
      </para>

      <para>
       With this change, array-type fields in the destination SQL type are
       properly converted from JSON arrays, and composite-type fields are
       properly converted from JSON objects.  Previously, such cases would
       fail because the text representation of the JSON value would be fed
       to <function>array_in()</> or <function>record_in()</>, and its
       syntax would not match what those input functions expect.

        Previously, setting one of <application>psql</>'s special variables

        <command>\set</> on a special variable now fails if the proposed
        new value is invalid.  As a special exception, <command>\set</>
        with an empty or omitted new value, on a boolean-valued special
        variable, still has the effect of setting the variable
        to <literal>on</>; but now it actually acquires that value rather
        than an empty string.  <command>\unset</> on a special variable now
        explicitly sets the variable to its default value, which is also
        the value it acquires at startup.  In sum, a control variable now
        always has a displayable value that reflects
        what <application>psql</> is actually doing.
