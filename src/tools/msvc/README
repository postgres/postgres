This directory contains the tools required to build PostgreSQL using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. This builds the whole backend, not just
the libpq frontend library. For more information, see the documentation
chapter "Installation on Windows".


Notes about code indention
--------------------------
If the perl code is modified, use perltidy on it since pgindent won't
touch perl code. Use the following commandline:
perltidy -b -bl -nsfs -naws -l=100 -ole=unix *.pl *.pm

Notes about Visual Studio Express
---------------------------------
To build PostgreSQL using Visual Studio Express, the Platform SDK
has to be installed. Since this is not included in the product 
originally, extra steps are needed to make it work.

First, download and install the latest Platform SDK from 
www.microsoft.com. 

Locate the files vcprojectengine.dll.express.config and 
vcprojectengine.dll.config in the vc\vcpackages directory of
the Visual C++ Express installation. In these files, add the paths
to the Platform SDK to the Include, Library and Path tags. Be sure
to add them to the beginning of the list.

This should work for both GUI and commandline builds, but a restart
may be necessary.
