 <title>passwordcheck &mdash; verify password strength</title>

 <para>
  The <filename>passwordcheck</filename> module checks users' passwords
  whenever they are set with
  <xref linkend="sql-createrole"/> or
  <xref linkend="sql-alterrole"/>.
  If a password is considered too weak, it will be rejected and
  the command will terminate with an error.
 </para>

 <para>
  To enable this module, add <literal>'$libdir/passwordcheck'</literal>
  to <xref linkend="guc-shared-preload-libraries"/> in
  <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, then restart the server.
 </para>

 <para>
  You can adapt this module to your needs by changing the source code.
  For example, you can use
  <ulink url="https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib">CrackLib</ulink>
  to check passwords &mdash; this only requires uncommenting
  two lines in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and rebuilding the
  module.  (We cannot include <productname>CrackLib</productname>
  by default for license reasons.)
  Without <productname>CrackLib</productname>, the module enforces a few
  simple rules for password strength, which you can modify or extend
  as you see fit.
 </para>

 <caution>
  <para>
   To prevent unencrypted passwords from being sent across the network,
   written to the server log or otherwise stolen by a database administrator,
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows the user to supply
   pre-encrypted passwords. Many client programs make use of this
   functionality and encrypt the password before sending it to the server.
  </para>
  <para>
   This limits the usefulness of the <filename>passwordcheck</filename>
   module, because in that case it can only try to guess the password.
   For this reason, <filename>passwordcheck</filename> is not
   recommended if your security requirements are high.
   It is more secure to use an external authentication method such as GSSAPI
   (see <xref linkend="client-authentication"/>) than to rely on
   passwords within the database.
  </para>
  <para>
   Alternatively, you could modify <filename>passwordcheck</filename>
   to reject pre-encrypted passwords, but forcing users to set their
   passwords in clear text carries its own security risks.

      The minimum acceptable password length in bytes.  The default is 8.  Only
      superusers can change this setting.

      <para>
       This parameter has no effect if a user supplies a pre-encrypted
       password.

   In ordinary usage, this parameter is set in
   <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, but superusers can alter it on-the-fly
   within their own sessions.  Typical usage might be:

# postgresql.conf
