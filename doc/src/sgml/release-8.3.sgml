     <para>
      Prevent execution of <function>enum_recv</> from SQL (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The function was misdeclared, allowing a simple SQL command to crash the
      server.  In principle an attacker might be able to use it to examine the
      contents of server memory.  Our thanks to Sumit Soni (via Secunia SVCRP)
      for reporting this issue.  (CVE-2013-0255)

     <para>
      Fix multiple bugs associated with <command>CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</> (Andres Freund, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <structname>pg_index</> row.  This prevents race conditions that could
      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <command>CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</> command.  The most important of these is
      <command>VACUUM</>, because an auto-vacuum could easily be launched
      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Avoid corruption of internal hash tables when out of memory
      (Hitoshi Harada)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix planning of non-strict equivalence clauses above outer joins
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The planner could derive incorrect constraints from a clause equating
      a non-strict construct to something else, for example
      <literal>WHERE COALESCE(foo, 0) = 0</>
      when <literal>foo</> is coming from the nullable side of an outer join.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix partial-row matching in hashed subplans to handle cross-type cases
      correctly (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This affects multicolumn <literal>NOT IN</> subplans, such as
      <literal>WHERE (a, b) NOT IN (SELECT x, y FROM ...)</>
      when for instance <literal>b</> and <literal>y</> are <type>int4</>
      and <type>int8</> respectively.  This mistake led to wrong answers
      or crashes depending on the specific datatypes involved.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Acquire buffer lock when re-fetching the old tuple for an
      <literal>AFTER ROW UPDATE/DELETE</> trigger (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In very unusual circumstances, this oversight could result in passing
      incorrect data to the precheck logic for a foreign-key enforcement
      trigger.  That could result in a crash, or in an incorrect decision
      about whether to fire the trigger.
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix <command>REASSIGN OWNED</> to handle grants on tablespaces
      (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera)

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Ignore incorrect <structname>pg_attribute</> entries for system
      columns for views (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Views do not have any system columns.  However, we forgot to
      remove such entries when converting a table to a view.  That's fixed
      properly for 9.3 and later, but in previous branches we need to defend
      against existing mis-converted views.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>

      Fix rule printing to dump <literal>INSERT INTO <replaceable>table</>

      Guard against stack overflow when there are too many
      <literal>UNION</>/<literal>INTERSECT</>/<literal>EXCEPT</> clauses
      in a query (Tom Lane)

      integer value by -1 (Xi Wang, Tom Lane)

      Produce an understandable error message if the length of the path name
      for a Unix-domain socket exceeds the platform-specific limit
      (Tom Lane, Andrew Dunstan)
     </para>

     <para>
      Formerly, this would result in something quite unhelpful, such as
      <quote>Non-recoverable failure in name resolution</>.

      client-only encoding, such as SJIS (Jiang Guiqing)
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix bugs in the <filename>restore.sql</> script emitted by
      <application>pg_dump</> in <literal>tar</> output format (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The script would fail outright on tables whose names include
      upper-case characters.  Also, make the script capable of restoring
      data in <option>--inserts</> mode as well as the regular COPY mode.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <application>pg_restore</> to accept POSIX-conformant
      <literal>tar</> files (Brian Weaver, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The original coding of <application>pg_dump</>'s <literal>tar</>
      output mode produced files that are not fully conformant with the
      POSIX standard.  This has been corrected for version 9.3.  This
      patch updates previous branches so that they will accept both the
      incorrect and the corrected formats, in hopes of avoiding
      compatibility problems when 9.3 comes out.

      This mistake could lead to <application>pg_resetxlog</> not noticing

      Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references
      (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <function>xml_parse()</> would attempt to fetch external files or
      URLs as needed to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value,
      thus allowing unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data
      with the privileges of the database server.  While the external data
      wouldn't get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be
      exposed in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and
      in any case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be
      useful to an attacker.  (CVE-2012-3489)
     </para>

     <para>
      Prevent access to external files/URLs via <filename>contrib/xml2</>'s
      <function>xslt_process()</> (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libxslt</> offers the ability to read and write both
      files and URLs through stylesheet commands, thus allowing
      unprivileged database users to both read and write data with the
      privileges of the database server.  Disable that through proper use
      of <application>libxslt</>'s security options.  (CVE-2012-3488)
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, remove <function>xslt_process()</>'s ability to fetch documents
      and stylesheets from external files/URLs.  While this was a
      documented <quote>feature</>, it was long regarded as a bad idea.
      The fix for CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than
      expend effort on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily
      remove it.

      Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
      introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
      recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
      This would result in incorrect index search results.  The probability
      of such an error occurring in the field seems very low because of the
      timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be fixed.

      Fix crash-safety bug with newly-created-or-reset sequences (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      If <command>ALTER SEQUENCE</> was executed on a freshly created or
      reset sequence, and then precisely one <function>nextval()</> call
      was made on it, and then the server crashed, WAL replay would restore
      the sequence to a state in which it appeared that no
      <function>nextval()</> had been done, thus allowing the first
      sequence value to be returned again by the next
      <function>nextval()</> call.  In particular this could manifest for
      <type>serial</> columns, since creation of a serial column's sequence

     <para>
      This situation can arise in <command>CREATE TABLE</> with
      <literal>LIKE</> or <literal>INHERITS</>.  The copied whole-row
      variable was incorrectly labeled with the row type of the original
      table not the new one.  Rejecting the case seems reasonable for
      <literal>LIKE</>, since the row types might well diverge later.  For
      <literal>INHERITS</> we should ideally allow it, with an implicit
      coercion to the parent table's row type; but that will require more
      work than seems safe to back-patch.

     <para>
      If a password string contained the byte value <literal>0x80</>, the
      remainder of the password was ignored, causing the password to be much
      weaker than it appeared.  With this fix, the rest of the string is
      properly included in the DES hash.  Any stored password values that are
      affected by this bug will thus no longer match, so the stored values may

      Require execute permission on the trigger function for
      <command>CREATE TRIGGER</> (Robert Haas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This missing check could allow another user to execute a trigger
      function with forged input data, by installing it on a table he owns.
      This is only of significance for trigger functions marked

     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dump</> was incautious about sanitizing object names
      that are emitted within SQL comments in its output script.  A name
      containing a newline would at least render the script syntactically
      incorrect.  Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL

      Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with vacuuming
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a
      concurrently-running <command>VACUUM</> to miss removing index entries
      that it should remove.  After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as <quote>could not
      read block N in file ...</>) or worse, silently wrong query results
      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations.
      This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently
      that it was not diagnosed until now.  If you have reason to suspect
      that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index
      will fix things.

      in another database where the setting is intended to be used, or for the
      tablespace cases because the tablespace might not be created yet.  The
      same issue was previously recognized for <varname>search_path</>, and

      Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even when it wraps

     </para>

     <para>
      Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high value until the
      system exited replay mode.  The practical consequences of that are
      usually nil, but there are scenarios wherein a standby server that's
      been promoted to master might take a long time to advance the OID
      counter to a reasonable value once values are needed.

      Fix regular expression back-references with <literal>*</> attached

      Rather than enforcing an exact string match, the code would effectively
      accept any string that satisfies the pattern sub-expression referenced
      by the back-reference symbol.

     <para>
      A similar problem still afflicts back-references that are embedded in a

     <para>
      <application>pg_dump</> mishandled situations where a child column has
      a different default expression than its parent column.  If the default
      is textually identical to the parent's default, but not actually the
      same (for instance, because of schema search path differences) it would
      not be recognized as different, so that after dump and restore the
      child would be allowed to inherit the parent's default.  Child columns

      Fix bugs in <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the view definition is installed by <application>initdb</>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this
      in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the
      <literal>information_schema</> schema then re-create it by sourcing

      If a table has been modified by <command>ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</>,

      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</> trigger and the
      <literal>CHECK</> trigger as one event.  The <literal>ON UPDATE</>
      trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

      Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl and
      PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by subverting
      Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same session under
      another SQL user identity (for example, within a <literal>SECURITY
      DEFINER</> function).  Most scripting languages offer numerous ways that
      that might be done, such as redefining standard functions or operators
      called by the target function.  Without this change, any SQL user with
      Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with the
      SQL privileges of the target function's owner.
     </para>

     <para>
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among Perl
      and Tcl functions becomes more difficult.  To provide an escape hatch,
      PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one interpreter
      per session.  This is not considered a security issue since all such
      functions execute at the trust level of a database superuser already.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to offer
      trusted execution have similar security issues.  We advise contacting
      the authors of any PL you are depending on for security-critical
      purposes.

     <para>
      Under high load, Windows processes will sometimes fail at startup with
      this error code.  Formerly the postmaster treated this as a panic

      This omission could result in corrupted lockfile contents if the

      a separate interpreter with an opcode mask that is always applied.
      Pleasant side effects of the change include that it is now possible to
      use Perl's <literal>strict</> pragma in a natural way in
      <literal>plperl</>, and that Perl's <literal>$a</> and <literal>$b</>
      variables work as expected in sort routines, and that function
      compilation is significantly faster.  (CVE-2010-1169)

      Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from

     </para>

     <para>
      PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from a database table
      could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks, because there was no
      restriction on who could create or insert into that table.  This change
      disables the feature unless <structname>pltcl_modules</> is owned by a
      superuser.  (However, the permissions on the table are not checked, so
      installations that really need a less-than-secure modules table can
      still grant suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.)  Also,
      prevent loading code into the unrestricted <quote>normal</> Tcl
      interpreter unless we are really going to execute a <literal>pltclu</>

      This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which may
      be required if a broken SSL library is used.  In particular, some

      This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts with

      Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
      related failure scenarios.  The previous fixes were narrowly tailored
      for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that
      <emphasis>any</> error thrown by an encoding conversion function could
      potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the
      error.  The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding
      conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message,
      if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.
      (CVE-2009-0922)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disallow <command>CREATE CONVERSION</> with the wrong encodings
      for the specified conversion function (Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion failure.
      The previous change is a backstop to guard against other kinds of
      failures in the same area.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <function>xpath()</> to not modify the path expression unless
      necessary, and to make a saner attempt at it when necessary (Andrew)
     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard suggests that <function>xpath</> should work on data
      that is a document fragment, but <application>libxml</> doesn't support
      that, and indeed it's not clear that this is sensible according to the
      XPath standard.  <function>xpath</> attempted to work around this
      mismatch by modifying both the data and the path expression, but the
      modification was buggy and could cause valid searches to fail.  Now,
      <function>xpath</> checks whether the data is in fact a well-formed
      document, and if so invokes <application>libxml</> with no change to the
      data or path expression.  Otherwise, a different modification method
      that is somewhat less likely to fail is used.
     </para>

     <note>
      <para>
       The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory, and it
       seems likely that no real solution is possible.  This patch should
       therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking existing
       applications unnecessarily.  It is likely that
       <productname>PostgreSQL</> 8.4 will simply reject use of
       <function>xpath</> on data that is not a well-formed document.

      Fix decompilation of <literal>CASE WHEN</> with an implicit coercion

     <para>
      This mistake could lead to Assert failures in an Assert-enabled build,

      cases, when trying to examine or dump a view.

      Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      If <command>CLUSTER</> or a rewriting variant of <command>ALTER TABLE</>
      were executed by someone other than the table owner, the
      <structname>pg_type</> entry for the table's TOAST table would end up
      marked as owned by that someone.  This caused no immediate problems,
      since the permissions on the TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any
      ordinary database operation.  However, it could lead to unexpected
      failures if one later tried to drop the role that issued the command
      (in 8.1 or 8.2), or <quote>owner of data type appears to be invalid</>
      warnings from <application>pg_dump</> after having done so (in 8.3).

     </para>

     <para>
      Most of the time this is not a particularly useful optimization, but
      since <command>DISCARD ALL</> invokes <command>UNLISTEN</>, the previous
      coding caused a substantial performance problem for applications that
      made heavy use of <command>DISCARD ALL</>.

      We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if

      Make <function>pg_get_ruledef()</> parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be dumped
      as, say, <literal>-42::integer</>, which is subtly incorrect: it should
      be <literal>(-42)::integer</> due to operator precedence rules.
      Usually this would make little difference, but it could interact with
      another recent patch to cause
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> to reject what had been a valid
      <command>SELECT DISTINCT</> view query.  Since this could result in
      <application>pg_dump</> output failing to reload, it is being treated
      as a high-priority fix.  The only released versions in which dump
      output is actually incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.

     <para>
      This mistake partially disabled optimization of unnamed
      extended-Query statements in 8.3.0 and 8.3.1: in particular the
      LIKE-to-indexscan optimization would never be applied if the LIKE
      pattern was passed as a parameter, and constraint exclusion

     </para>

     <para>
      This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical literal

      expressions.

      (<literal>substring(<replaceable>string</> from

     </para>

     <para>
      The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
      the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
      subexpression hasn't got a match.  An example is
      <literal>substring('foo' from 'foo(bar)?')</>.
      This should return NULL, since <literal>(bar)</> isn't matched, but
      it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match instead (ie,
      <literal>foo</>).

      Fix character string comparison for Windows locales that consider

     </para>

     <para>
      This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8
      database encoding.  The same fix was made for all other cases
      over two years ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code
      path that was not updated.  If you are using a locale that
      considers some non-identical strings as equal, you may need to
      <command>REINDEX</> to fix existing indexes on textual columns.

      Repair corner-case bugs in <command>VACUUM FULL</> (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      A potential deadlock between concurrent <command>VACUUM FULL</>
      operations on different system catalogs was introduced in 8.2.
      This has now been corrected.  8.3 made this worse because the
      deadlock could occur within a critical code section, making it
      a PANIC rather than just ERROR condition.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, a <command>VACUUM FULL</> that failed partway through
      vacuuming a system catalog could result in cache corruption in
      concurrent database sessions.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another <command>VACUUM FULL</> bug introduced in 8.3 could

     </para>

     <para>
      This bug affected only protocol-level prepare operations, not

     <para>
      In rare cases a session that had just executed a
      <command>LISTEN</> might not get a notification, even though
      one would be expected because the concurrent transaction executing
      <command>NOTIFY</> was observed to commit later.
     </para>

     <para>
      A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed
      a not-yet-committed <command>LISTEN</> command will not see any
      row in <structname>pg_listener</> for the <command>LISTEN</>,
      should it choose to look; formerly it would have.  This behavior
      was never documented one way or the other, but it is possible that

      This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various unpleasant

     <para>
      This function should have been removed before 8.3 release, but

   <para>
    With significant new functionality and performance enhancements,
    this release represents a major leap forward for
    <productname>PostgreSQL</>. This was made possible by a growing
    community that has dramatically accelerated the pace of
    development. This release adds the following major features:

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Non-character data types are no longer automatically cast to
       <type>TEXT</> (Peter, Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       Previously, if a non-character value was supplied to an operator or
       function that requires <type>text</> input, it was automatically
       cast to <type>text</>, for most (though not all) built-in data types.
       This no longer happens: an explicit cast to <type>text</> is now
       required for all non-character-string types.  For example, these
       expressions formerly worked:

<programlisting>
substr(current_date, 1, 4)
23 LIKE '2%'
</programlisting>

       but will now draw <quote>function does not exist</> and <quote>operator
       does not exist</> errors respectively.  Use an explicit cast instead:

<programlisting>
substr(current_date::text, 1, 4)
23::text LIKE '2%'
</programlisting>

       (Of course, you can use the more verbose <literal>CAST()</> syntax too.)
       The reason for the change is that these automatic casts too often caused
       surprising behavior.  An example is that in previous releases, this
       expression was accepted but did not do what was expected:

<programlisting>
current_date &lt; 2017-11-17
</programlisting>

       This is actually comparing a date to an integer, which should be
       (and now is) rejected &mdash; but in the presence of automatic
       casts both sides were cast to <type>text</> and a textual comparison
       was done, because the <literal>text &lt; text</> operator was able
       to match the expression when no other <literal>&lt;</> operator could.
      </para>

      <para>
       Types <type>char(<replaceable>n</>)</type> and
       <type>varchar(<replaceable>n</>)</type> still cast to <type>text</>
       automatically.  Also, automatic casting to <type>text</> still works for
       inputs to the concatenation (<literal>||</>) operator, so long as least
       one input is a character-string type.

        Full text search features from <filename>contrib/tsearch2</> have

      </para>

      <para>
       The old naming convention is still honored when possible, but
       application code should no longer depend on it. Instead
       use the new <literal>pg_type.typarray</literal> column to
       identify the array data type associated with a given type.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>ORDER BY ... USING</> <replaceable>operator</> must now

       This restriction was added to prevent inconsistent results.

      <para>
       Previously <command>SET LOCAL</command>'s effects were lost

       For example, <literal>"BEGIN; DROP DATABASE; COMMIT"</> will now be
       rejected even if submitted as a single query message.

      <para>
       On most platforms, <literal>C</> locale is the only locale that
       will work with any database encoding.  Other locale settings imply
       a specific encoding and will misbehave if the database encoding
       is something different.  (Typical symptoms include bogus textual
       sort order and wrong results from <function>upper()</> or
       <function>lower()</>.)  The server now rejects attempts to create
       databases that have an incompatible encoding.

       Asynchronous commit delays writes to WAL during transaction commit
       (Simon)
      </para>

      <para>
       This feature dramatically increases performance for short data-modifying
       transactions.  The disadvantage is that because disk writes are delayed,
       if the database or operating system crashes before data is written to
       the disk, committed data will be lost.  This feature is useful for
       applications that can accept some data loss.  Unlike turning off
       <varname>fsync</varname>, using asynchronous commit does not put
       database consistency at risk; the worst case is that after a crash the
       last few reportedly-committed transactions might not be committed after
       all.
       This feature is enabled by turning off <varname>synchronous_commit</>
       (which can be done per-session or per-transaction, if some transactions
       are critical and others are not).
       <varname>wal_writer_delay</> can be adjusted to control the maximum
       delay before transactions actually reach disk.

       Checkpoint writes can be spread over a longer time period to smooth
       the I/O spike during each checkpoint (Itagaki Takahiro and Heikki
       Linnakangas)
      </para>

      <para>
       Previously all modified buffers were forced to disk as quickly as
       possible during a
       checkpoint, causing an I/O spike that decreased server performance.
       This new approach spreads out disk writes during checkpoints,
       reducing peak I/O usage. (User-requested and shutdown checkpoints
       are still written as quickly as possible.)

      </para>

      <para>
       <command>UPDATE</>s and <command>DELETE</>s leave dead tuples
       behind, as do failed <command>INSERT</>s.  Previously only
       <command>VACUUM</> could reclaim space taken by dead tuples. With
       <acronym>HOT</> dead tuple space can be automatically reclaimed at
       the time of <command>INSERT</> or <command>UPDATE</> if no changes
       are made to indexed columns.  This allows for more consistent
       performance.  Also, <acronym>HOT</> avoids adding duplicate index

       Using non-persistent transaction IDs for read-only transactions

      </para>

      <para>
       Non-persistent transaction IDs do not increment the global
       transaction counter. Therefore, they reduce the load on
       <structname>pg_clog</> and increase the time between forced
       vacuums to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
       Other performance
       improvements were also made that should improve concurrency.

       If this returns true after a failed connection attempt, a client
       application should prompt the user for a password.  In the past
       applications have had to check for a specific error message string to
       decide whether a password is needed; that approach is now
