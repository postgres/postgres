# Most test scripts can be run after running just test_setup and possibly
# create_index.  Exceptions to this rule are documented below.
#
# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# required setup steps
test: test_setup

# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# multirangetypes depends on rangetypes
# multirangetypes shouldn't run concurrently with type_sanity
# ----------
test: strings md5 numerology point lseg line box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval inet macaddr macaddr8 multirangetypes

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, line, box, path, polygon, circle
# horology depends on date, time, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz, interval
# ----------
test: geometry horology tstypes regex type_sanity opr_sanity misc_sanity comments expressions unicode xid mvcc database

# ----------
# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests in parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.
# ----------
test: copy copyselect copydml insert insert_conflict

# ----------
# More groups of parallel tests
# Note: many of the tests in later groups depend on create_index
# ----------

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.
# ----------
test: sanity_check

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# aggregates depends on create_aggregate

# so keep this parallel group to at most 19 tests
# ----------
test: plancache limit plpgsql copy2 temp domain rangefuncs prepare conversion truncate alter_table sequence polymorphism rowtypes returning largeobject with xml

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests

# The stats test resets stats, so nothing else needing stats access can be in
# this group.
# ----------

# event_trigger depends on create_am and cannot run concurrently with
# any test that runs DDL
# oidjoins is read-only, though, and should run late for best coverage
test: oidjoins event_trigger

# event_trigger_login cannot run concurrently with any other tests because
# on-login event handling could catch connection of a concurrent test.
test: event_trigger_login

# this test also uses event triggers, so likewise run it by itself
test: fast_default

# setup that other tests may use.
test: tablespace
