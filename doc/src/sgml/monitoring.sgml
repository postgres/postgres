 <para>
  A database administrator frequently wonders, <quote>What is the system
  doing right now?</quote>
  This chapter discusses how to find that out.
 </para>

  <para>
   Several tools are available for monitoring database activity and
   analyzing performance.  Most of this chapter is devoted to describing
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s statistics collector,
   but one should not neglect regular Unix monitoring programs such as
   <command>ps</>, <command>top</>, <command>iostat</>, and <command>vmstat</>.
   Also, once one has identified a
   poorly-performing query, further investigation might be needed using
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <xref linkend="sql-explain"
   endterm="sql-explain-title"> command.
   <xref linkend="using-explain"> discusses <command>EXPLAIN</>
   and other methods for understanding the behavior of an individual
   query.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="monitoring-ps">
  <title>Standard Unix Tools</Title>

  <indexterm zone="monitoring-ps">
   <primary>ps</primary>
   <secondary>to monitor activity</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   On most platforms, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> modifies its
   command title as reported by <command>ps</>, so that individual server
   processes can readily be identified.  A sample display is

<screen>
$ ps auxww | grep ^postgres
postgres   960  0.0  1.1  6104 1480 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postgres -i
postgres   963  0.0  1.1  7084 1472 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postgres: writer process
postgres   965  0.0  1.1  6152 1512 pts/1    SN   13:17   0:00 postgres: stats collector process   
postgres   998  0.0  2.3  6532 2992 pts/1    SN   13:18   0:00 postgres: tgl runbug 127.0.0.1 idle
postgres  1003  0.0  2.4  6532 3128 pts/1    SN   13:19   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] SELECT waiting
postgres  1016  0.1  2.4  6532 3080 pts/1    SN   13:19   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] idle in transaction
</screen>

   (The appropriate invocation of <command>ps</> varies across different
   platforms, as do the details of what is shown.  This example is from a
   recent Linux system.)  The first process listed here is the
   master server process.  The command arguments
   shown for it are the same ones given when it was launched.  The next two
   processes are background worker processes automatically launched by the
   master process.  (The <quote>stats collector</> process will not be present
   if you have set
   the system not to start the statistics collector.)  Each of the remaining
   processes is a server process handling one client connection.  Each such
   process sets its command line display in the form

<screen>
postgres: <replaceable>user</> <replaceable>database</> <replaceable>host</> <replaceable>activity</>
</screen>

  The user, database, and connection source host items remain the same for
  the life of the client connection, but the activity indicator changes.
  The activity can be <literal>idle</> (i.e., waiting for a client command),
  <literal>idle in transaction</> (waiting for client inside a <command>BEGIN</> block),
  or a command type name such as <literal>SELECT</>.  Also,
  <literal>waiting</> is attached if the server process is presently waiting
  on a lock held by another server process.  In the above example we can infer
  that process 1003 is waiting for process 1016 to complete its transaction and
  thereby release some lock or other.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have turned off <xref linkend="guc-update-process-title"> then the
   activity indicator is not updated; the process title is set only once
   when a new process is launched.  On some platforms this saves a useful
   amount of per-command overhead, on others it's insignificant.
  </para>

  <tip>
  <para>
  <productname>Solaris</productname> requires special handling. You must
  use <command>/usr/ucb/ps</command>, rather than
  <command>/bin/ps</command>. You also must use two <option>w</option>
  flags, not just one. In addition, your original invocation of the
  <command>postgres</command> command must have a shorter
  <command>ps</command> status display than that provided by each
  server process.  If you fail to do all three things, the <command>ps</>
  output for each server process will be the original <command>postgres</>
  command line.
  </para>

  <title>The Statistics Collector</Title>

  <indexterm zone="monitoring-stats">
   <primary>statistics</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <firstterm>statistics collector</>
   is a subsystem that supports collection and reporting of information about
   server activity.  Presently, the collector can count accesses to tables
   and indexes in both disk-block and individual-row terms.  It also tracks
   total numbers of rows in each table, and the last vacuum and analyze times
   for each table.  It can also count calls to user-defined functions and
   the total time spent in each one.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also supports determining the exact
   command currently being executed by other server processes.  This is an
   independent facility that does not depend on the collector process.
  </para>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-setup">
  <title>Statistics Collection Configuration</Title>

  <para>
   Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution,
   the system can be configured to collect or not collect information.
   This is controlled by configuration parameters that are normally set in
   <filename>postgresql.conf</>.  (See <xref linkend="runtime-config"> for
   details about setting configuration parameters.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-counts"> controls whether
   statistics are collected about table and index accesses.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-functions"> enables tracking of
   usage of user-defined functions.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-activities"> enables monitoring
   of the current command being executed by any server process.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally these parameters are set in <filename>postgresql.conf</> so
   that they apply to all server processes, but it is possible to turn
   them on or off in individual sessions using the <xref
   linkend="sql-set" endterm="sql-set-title"> command. (To prevent
   ordinary users from hiding their activity from the administrator,
   only superusers are allowed to change these parameters with
   <command>SET</>.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The statistics collector communicates with the backends needing 
   information (including autovacuum) through temporary files.
   These files are stored in the <filename>pg_stat_tmp</filename> subdirectory.
   When the postmaster shuts down, a permanent copy of the statistics
   data is stored in the <filename>global</filename> subdirectory. For increased
   performance, the parameter <xref linkend="guc-stats-temp-directory"> can
   be pointed at a RAM based filesystem, decreasing physical I/O requirements.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-views">
  <title>Viewing Collected Statistics</Title>

  <para>
   Several predefined views, listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-views-table">, are available to show the results
   of statistics collection.  Alternatively, one can
   build custom views using the underlying statistics functions.
  </para>

  <para>
   When using the statistics to monitor current activity, it is important
   to realize that the information does not update instantaneously.
   Each individual server process transmits new statistical counts to
   the collector just before going idle; so a query or transaction still in
   progress does not affect the displayed totals.  Also, the collector itself
   emits a new report at most once per <varname>PGSTAT_STAT_INTERVAL</varname>
   milliseconds (500 unless altered while building the server).  So the
   displayed information lags behind actual activity.  However, current-query
   information collected by <varname>track_activities</varname> is
   always up-to-date.
  </para>

  <para>
   Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display
   any of these statistics, it first fetches the most recent report emitted by
   the collector process and then continues to use this snapshot for all
   statistical views and functions until the end of its current transaction.
   So the statistics will appear not to change as long as you continue the
   current transaction.  Similarly, information about the current queries of
   all processes is collected when any such information is first requested
   within a transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout
   the transaction.
   This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform several
   queries on the statistics and correlate the results without worrying that
   the numbers are changing underneath you.  But if you want to see new
   results with each query, be sure to do the queries outside any transaction
   block.  Alternatively, you can invoke
   <function>pg_stat_clear_snapshot</function>(), which will discard the
   current transaction's statistics snapshot (if any).  The next use of
   statistical information will cause a new snapshot to be fetched.

  <para>
   The per-index statistics are particularly useful to determine which
   indexes are being used and how effective they are.
  </para>

  <para>
   Beginning in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 8.1, indexes can be
   used either directly or via <quote>bitmap scans</>.  In a bitmap scan
   the output of several indexes can be combined via AND or OR rules;
   so it is difficult to associate individual heap row fetches 
   with specific indexes when a bitmap scan is used.  Therefore, a bitmap
   scan increments the
   <structname>pg_stat_all_indexes</>.<structfield>idx_tup_read</>
   count(s) for the index(es) it uses, and it increments the
   <structname>pg_stat_all_tables</>.<structfield>idx_tup_fetch</>
   count for the table, but it does not affect
   <structname>pg_stat_all_indexes</>.<structfield>idx_tup_fetch</>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    Before <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 8.1, the
    <structfield>idx_tup_read</> and <structfield>idx_tup_fetch</> counts
    were essentially always equal.  Now they can be different even without
    considering bitmap scans, because <structfield>idx_tup_read</> counts
    index entries retrieved from the index while <structfield>idx_tup_fetch</>
    counts live rows fetched from the table; the latter will be less if any
    dead or not-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   The <structname>pg_statio_</> views are primarily useful to
   determine the effectiveness of the buffer cache.  When the number
   of actual disk reads is much smaller than the number of buffer
   hits, then the cache is satisfying most read requests without
   invoking a kernel call. However, these statistics do not give the
   entire story: due to the way in which <productname>PostgreSQL</>
   handles disk I/O, data that is not in the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> buffer cache might still reside in the
   kernel's I/O cache, and might therefore still be fetched without
   requiring a physical read. Users interested in obtaining more
   detailed information on <productname>PostgreSQL</> I/O behavior are
   advised to use the <productname>PostgreSQL</> statistics collector
   in combination with operating system utilities that allow insight
   into the kernel's handling of I/O.
  </para>

  <para>
   Other ways of looking at the statistics can be set up by writing
   queries that use the same underlying statistics access functions as
   these standard views do.  These functions are listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-funcs-table">.  The per-database access
   functions take a database OID as argument to identify which
   database to report on.  The per-table and per-index functions take
   a table or index OID.  The functions for function-call statistics
   take a function OID.  (Note that only tables, indexes, and functions
   in the current database can be seen with these functions.)  The
   per-server-process access functions take a server process
   number, which ranges from one to the number of currently active
   server processes.

   All functions to access information about backends are indexed by backend id

   The function <function>pg_stat_get_backend_idset</function> provides
   a convenient way to generate one row for each active server process.  For
   example, to show the <acronym>PID</>s and current queries of all server processes:

<programlisting>
SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_pid(s.backendid) AS procpid,

   Another useful tool for monitoring database activity is the

   locks in the lock manager. For example, this capability can be used
   to:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      View all the locks currently outstanding, all the locks on
      relations in a particular database, all the locks on a
      particular relation, or all the locks held by a particular
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> session.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Determine the relation in the current database with the most
      ungranted locks (which might be a source of contention among
      database clients).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Determine the effect of lock contention on overall database

 <indexterm zone="dynamic-trace">

 </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides facilities to support
   dynamic tracing of the database server. This allows an external
   utility to be called at specific points in the code and thereby trace
   execution.
  </para>

  <para>
   A number of probes or trace points are already inserted into the source
   code. These probes are intended to be used by database developers and
   administrators. By default the probes are not compiled into
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>; the user needs to explicitly tell
   the configure script to make the probes available.
  </para>

  <para>
   Currently, only the
   <ulink url="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/">DTrace</ulink>
   utility is supported, which is available
   on OpenSolaris, Solaris 10, and Mac OS X Leopard. It is expected that
   DTrace will be available in the future on FreeBSD and possibly other
   operating systems.  The
   <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</ulink> project
   for Linux also provides a DTrace equivalent.  Supporting other dynamic
   tracing utilities is theoretically possible by changing the definitions for
   the macros in <filename>src/include/utils/probes.h</>.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="compiling-for-trace">
   <title>Compiling for Dynamic Tracing</title>

  <para>
   By default, probes are not available, so you will need to
   explicitly tell the configure script to make the probes available

   specify <option>--enable-dtrace</> to configure.  See <xref

   <title>Using Probes</title>

   The example below shows a DTrace script for analyzing transaction
   counts in the system, as an alternative to snapshotting
   <structname>pg_stat_database</> before and after a performance test:
<programlisting>
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -qs

postgresql$1:::transaction-start
{
      @start["Start"] = count();
      self->ts  = timestamp;
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-abort
{
      @abort["Abort"] = count();
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-commit
/self->ts/
{
      @commit["Commit"] = count();
      @time["Total time (ns)"] = sum(timestamp - self->ts);
      self->ts=0;
}
</programlisting>
   When executed, the example D script gives output such as:
<screen>
# ./txn_count.d `pgrep -n postgres` or ./txn_count.d &lt;PID&gt;
^C

Start                                          71
Commit                                         70
Total time (ns)                        2312105013
</screen>
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    SystemTap uses a different notation for trace scripts than DTrace does,
    even though the underlying trace points are compatible.  One point worth
    noting is that at this writing, SystemTap scripts must reference probe
    names using double underlines in place of hyphens.  This is expected to
    be fixed in future SystemTap releases.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   You should remember that DTrace scripts need to be carefully written and
   debugged, otherwise the trace information collected might
   be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the
   instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When
   discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose
   the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.

   <title>Defining New Probes</title>

  <para>
   New probes can be defined within the code wherever the developer
   desires, though this will require a recompilation. Below are the steps
   for inserting new probes:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Decide on probe names and data to be made available through the probes
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Add the probe definitions to <filename>src/backend/utils/probes.d</>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Include <filename>pg_trace.h</> if it is not already present in the
     module(s) containing the probe points, and insert
     <literal>TRACE_POSTGRESQL</> probe macros at the desired locations
     in the source code
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Recompile and verify that the new probes are available
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Example:</title>
   <para>
    Here is an example of how you would add a probe to trace all new
    transactions by transaction ID.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Decide that the probe will be named <literal>transaction-start</> and
     requires a parameter of type LocalTransactionId
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Add the probe definition to <filename>src/backend/utils/probes.d</>:
<programlisting>
      probe transaction__start(LocalTransactionId);
</programlisting>
     Note the use of the double underline in the probe name. In a DTrace
     script using the probe, the double underline needs to be replaced with a
     hyphen, so <literal>transaction-start</> is the name to document for
     users.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     At compile time, <literal>transaction__start</> is converted to a macro
     called <literal>TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START</> (notice the
     underscores are single here), which is available by including
     <filename>pg_trace.h</>.  Add the macro call to the appropriate location
     in the source code.  In this case, it looks like the following:

<programlisting>
    TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(vxid.localTransactionId);
</programlisting>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     After recompiling and running the new binary, check that your newly added
     probe is available by executing the following DTrace command.  You
     should see similar output:
<screen>
# dtrace -ln transaction-start
   ID    PROVIDER          MODULE           FUNCTION NAME
18705 postgresql49878     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18755 postgresql49877     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18805 postgresql49876     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18855 postgresql49875     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18986 postgresql49873     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
</screen>
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   There are a few things to be careful about when adding trace macros
   to the C code:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You should take care that the data types specified for a probe's
      parameters match the data types of the variables used in the macro.
      Otherwise, you will get compilation errors.
     </para>
    </listitem>


    <listitem>
     <para>
      On most platforms, if <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is
      built with <option>--enable-dtrace</>, the arguments to a trace
      macro will be evaluated whenever control passes through the
      macro, <emphasis>even if no tracing is being done</>.  This is
      usually not worth worrying about if you are just reporting the
      values of a few local variables.  But beware of putting expensive
      function calls into the arguments.  If you need to do that,
      consider protecting the macro with a check to see if the trace
      is actually enabled:

<programlisting>
    if (TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START_ENABLED())
        TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(some_function(...));
</programlisting>

      Each trace macro has a corresponding <literal>ENABLED</> macro.
