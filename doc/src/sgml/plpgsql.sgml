  <title>Overview</title>

 <para>
  <application>PL/pgSQL</application> is a loadable procedural
  language for the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database
  system.  The design goals of <application>PL/pgSQL</> were to create
  a loadable procedural language that

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       can be used to create functions and trigger procedures,

   <para>
    Functions created with <application>PL/pgSQL</application> can be
    used anywhere that built-in functions could be used.
    For example, it is possible to
    create complex conditional computation functions and later use
    them to define operators or use them in index expressions.
   </para>

   <para>
    In <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.0 and later,
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application> is installed by default.
    However it is still a loadable module, so especially security-conscious
    administrators could choose to remove it.

   <title>Advantages of Using <application>PL/pgSQL</application></title>

    <para>
     <acronym>SQL</acronym> is the language <productname>PostgreSQL</>
     and most other relational databases use as query language. It's
     portable and easy to learn. But every <acronym>SQL</acronym>
     statement must be executed individually by the database server.
    </para>

    <para>
     That means that your client application must send each query to
     the database server, wait for it to be processed, receive and
     process the results, do some computation, then send further
     queries to the server.  All this incurs interprocess
     communication and will also incur network overhead if your client
     is on a different machine than the database server.
    </para>

    <para>
     With <application>PL/pgSQL</application> you can group a block of
     computation and a series of queries <emphasis>inside</emphasis>
     the database server, thus having the power of a procedural
     language and the ease of use of SQL, but with considerable
     savings of client/server communication overhead.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem><para> Extra round trips between
     client and server are eliminated </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para> Intermediate results that the client does not
     need do not have to be marshaled or transferred between server
     and client </para></listitem>

     <listitem><para> Multiple rounds of query
     parsing can be avoided </para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>
    <para> This can result in a considerable performance increase as
    compared to an application that does not use stored functions.
    </para>

    <para>
     Also, with <application>PL/pgSQL</application> you can use all
     the data types, operators and functions of SQL.

   <title>Supported Argument and Result Data Types</title>

    <para>
     Functions written in <application>PL/pgSQL</application> can accept
     as arguments any scalar or array data type supported by the server,
     and they can return a result of any of these types.  They can also
     accept or return any composite type (row type) specified by name.
     It is also possible to declare a <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
     function as returning <type>record</>, which means that the result
     is a row type whose columns are determined by specification in the
     calling query, as discussed in <xref linkend="queries-tablefunctions">.
    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions can be declared to accept a variable
     number of arguments by using the <literal>VARIADIC</> marker.  This
     works exactly the same way as for SQL functions, as discussed in
     <xref linkend="xfunc-sql-variadic-functions">.
    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions can also be declared to accept
     and return the polymorphic types
     <type>anyelement</type>, <type>anyarray</type>, <type>anynonarray</type>,
     <type>anyenum</>, and <type>anyrange</type>.  The actual
     data types handled by a polymorphic function can vary from call to
     call, as discussed in <xref linkend="extend-types-polymorphic">.
     An example is shown in <xref linkend="plpgsql-declaration-parameters">.
    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions can also be declared to return
     a <quote>set</> (or table) of any data type that can be returned as
     a single instance.  Such a function generates its output by executing
     <command>RETURN NEXT</> for each desired element of the result
     set, or by using <command>RETURN QUERY</> to output the result of
     evaluating a query.
    </para>

    <para>
     Finally, a <application>PL/pgSQL</> function can be declared to return
     <type>void</> if it has no useful return value.
    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions can also be declared with output
     parameters in place of an explicit specification of the return type.
     This does not add any fundamental capability to the language, but
     it is often convenient, especially for returning multiple values.
     The <literal>RETURNS TABLE</> notation can also be used in place
     of <literal>RETURNS SETOF</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Specific examples appear in

 <sect1 id="plpgsql-structure">
  <title>Structure of <application>PL/pgSQL</application></title>

  <para>
   <application>PL/pgSQL</application> is a block-structured language.
   The complete text of a function definition must be a
   <firstterm>block</>. A block is defined as:

<synopsis>
<optional> &lt;&lt;<replaceable>label</replaceable>&gt;&gt; </optional>
<optional> DECLARE
    <replaceable>declarations</replaceable> </optional>
BEGIN
    <replaceable>statements</replaceable>
END <optional> <replaceable>label</replaceable> </optional>;
</synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     Each declaration and each statement within a block is terminated
     by a semicolon.  A block that appears within another block must
     have a semicolon after <literal>END</literal>, as shown above;
     however the final <literal>END</literal> that
     concludes a function body does not require a semicolon.
    </para>

    <tip>
     <para>
      A common mistake is to write a semicolon immediately after
      <literal>BEGIN</>.  This is incorrect and will result in a syntax error.
     </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
     A <replaceable>label</replaceable> is only needed if you want to
     identify the block for use
     in an <literal>EXIT</> statement, or to qualify the names of the
     variables declared in the block.  If a label is given after
     <literal>END</>, it must match the label at the block's beginning.
    </para>

    <para>
     All key words are case-insensitive.
     Identifiers are implicitly converted to lower case
     unless double-quoted, just as they are in ordinary SQL commands.
    </para>

    <para>
     Comments work the same way in <application>PL/pgSQL</> code as in
     ordinary SQL.  A double dash (<literal>--</literal>) starts a comment
     that extends to the end of the line. A <literal>/*</literal> starts a
     block comment that extends to the matching occurrence of
     <literal>*/</literal>.  Block comments nest.
    </para>

    <para>
     Any statement in the statement section of a block
     can be a <firstterm>subblock</>.  Subblocks can be used for
     logical grouping or to localize variables to a small group
     of statements.  Variables declared in a subblock mask any
     similarly-named variables of outer blocks for the duration
     of the subblock; but you can access the outer variables anyway
     if you qualify their names with their block's label. For example:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION somefunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
&lt;&lt; outerblock &gt;&gt;
DECLARE
    quantity integer := 30;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 30
    quantity := 50;
    --
    -- Create a subblock
    --
    DECLARE
        quantity integer := 80;
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 80
        RAISE NOTICE 'Outer quantity here is %', outerblock.quantity;  -- Prints 50
    END;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 50

    RETURN quantity;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      There is actually a hidden <quote>outer block</> surrounding the body
      of any <application>PL/pgSQL</> function.  This block provides the
      declarations of the function's parameters (if any), as well as some
      special variables such as <literal>FOUND</literal> (see
      <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-diagnostics">).  The outer block is
      labeled with the function's name, meaning that parameters and special
      variables can be qualified with the function's name.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     It is important not to confuse the use of
     <command>BEGIN</>/<command>END</> for grouping statements in
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> with the similarly-named SQL commands
     for transaction
     control.  <application>PL/pgSQL</>'s <command>BEGIN</>/<command>END</>
     are only for grouping; they do not start or end a transaction.
     Functions and trigger procedures are always executed within a transaction
     established by an outer query &mdash; they cannot start or commit that
     transaction, since there would be no context for them to execute in.
     However, a block containing an <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause effectively
     forms a subtransaction that can be rolled back without affecting the
     outer transaction.  For more about that see <xref
     linkend="plpgsql-error-trapping">.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="plpgsql-declarations">
    <title>Declarations</title>

    <para>
     All variables used in a block must be declared in the
     declarations section of the block.
     (The only exceptions are that the loop variable of a <literal>FOR</> loop
     iterating over a range of integer values is automatically declared as an
     integer variable, and likewise the loop variable of a <literal>FOR</> loop
     iterating over a cursor's result is automatically declared as a
     record variable.)
    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> variables can have any SQL data type, such as
     <type>integer</type>, <type>varchar</type>, and
     <type>char</type>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Here are some examples of variable declarations:
<programlisting>
user_id integer;
quantity numeric(5);
url varchar;
myrow tablename%ROWTYPE;
myfield tablename.columnname%TYPE;
arow RECORD;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     The general syntax of a variable declaration is:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>name</replaceable> <optional> CONSTANT </optional> <replaceable>type</replaceable> <optional> COLLATE <replaceable>collation_name</replaceable> </optional> <optional> NOT NULL </optional> <optional> { DEFAULT | := | = } <replaceable>expression</replaceable> </optional>;
</synopsis>
      The <literal>DEFAULT</> clause, if given, specifies the initial value assigned
      to the variable when the block is entered.  If the <literal>DEFAULT</> clause
      is not given then the variable is initialized to the
      <acronym>SQL</acronym> null value.
      The <literal>CONSTANT</> option prevents the variable from being
      assigned to after initialization, so that its value will remain constant
      for the duration of the block.
      The <literal>COLLATE</> option specifies a collation to use for the
      variable (see <xref linkend="plpgsql-declaration-collation">).
      If <literal>NOT NULL</>
      is specified, an assignment of a null value results in a run-time
      error. All variables declared as <literal>NOT NULL</>
      must have a nonnull default value specified.
      Equal (<literal>=</>) can be used instead of PL/SQL-compliant
      <literal>:=</>.
     </para>

     <para>
      A variable's default value is evaluated and assigned to the variable
      each time the block is entered (not just once per function call).
      So, for example, assigning <literal>now()</literal> to a variable of type
      <type>timestamp</type> causes the variable to have the
      time of the current function call, not the time when the function was
      precompiled.
     </para>

     <para>
      Examples:
<programlisting>
quantity integer DEFAULT 32;
url varchar := 'http://mysite.com';
user_id CONSTANT integer := 10;
</programlisting>
     </para>

    <sect2 id="plpgsql-declaration-parameters">
     <title>Declaring Function Parameters</title>

     <para>
      Parameters passed to functions are named with the identifiers
      <literal>$1</literal>, <literal>$2</literal>,
      etc.  Optionally, aliases can be declared for
      <literal>$<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>
      parameter names for increased readability.  Either the alias or the
      numeric identifier can then be used to refer to the parameter value.
     </para>

     <para>
      There are two ways to create an alias.  The preferred way is to give a
      name to the parameter in the <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command> command,
      for example:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION sales_tax(subtotal real) RETURNS real AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN subtotal * 0.06;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
      The other way is to explicitly declare an alias, using the
      declaration syntax

<synopsis>
<replaceable>name</replaceable> ALIAS FOR $<replaceable>n</replaceable>;
</synopsis>

      The same example in this style looks like:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION sales_tax(real) RETURNS real AS $$
DECLARE
    subtotal ALIAS FOR $1;
BEGIN
    RETURN subtotal * 0.06;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
     </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      These two examples are not perfectly equivalent.  In the first case,
      <literal>subtotal</> could be referenced as
      <literal>sales_tax.subtotal</>, but in the second case it could not.
      (Had we attached a label to the inner block, <literal>subtotal</> could
      be qualified with that label, instead.)
     </para>
    </note>

     <para>
      Some more examples:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION instr(varchar, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    v_string ALIAS FOR $1;
    index ALIAS FOR $2;
BEGIN
    -- some computations using v_string and index here
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


CREATE FUNCTION concat_selected_fields(in_t sometablename) RETURNS text AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN in_t.f1 || in_t.f3 || in_t.f5 || in_t.f7;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      When a <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function is declared
      with output parameters, the output parameters are given
      <literal>$<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> names and optional
      aliases in just the same way as the normal input parameters.  An
      output parameter is effectively a variable that starts out NULL;
      it should be assigned to during the execution of the function.
      The final value of the parameter is what is returned.  For instance,
      the sales-tax example could also be done this way:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION sales_tax(subtotal real, OUT tax real) AS $$
BEGIN
    tax := subtotal * 0.06;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

      Notice that we omitted <literal>RETURNS real</> &mdash; we could have
      included it, but it would be redundant.
     </para>

     <para>
      Output parameters are most useful when returning multiple values.
      A trivial example is:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION sum_n_product(x int, y int, OUT sum int, OUT prod int) AS $$
BEGIN
    sum := x + y;
    prod := x * y;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

      As discussed in <xref linkend="xfunc-output-parameters">, this
      effectively creates an anonymous record type for the function's
      results.  If a <literal>RETURNS</> clause is given, it must say
      <literal>RETURNS record</>.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another way to declare a <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function
      is with <literal>RETURNS TABLE</>, for example:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION extended_sales(p_itemno int)
RETURNS TABLE(quantity int, total numeric) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT s.quantity, s.quantity * s.price FROM sales AS s
                 WHERE s.itemno = p_itemno;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

      This is exactly equivalent to declaring one or more <literal>OUT</>
      parameters and specifying <literal>RETURNS SETOF
      <replaceable>sometype</></literal>.
     </para>

     <para>
      When the return type of a <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
      function is declared as a polymorphic type (<type>anyelement</type>,
      <type>anyarray</type>, <type>anynonarray</type>, <type>anyenum</type>,
      or <type>anyrange</type>), a special parameter <literal>$0</literal>
      is created.  Its data type is the actual return type of the function,
      as deduced from the actual input types (see <xref
      linkend="extend-types-polymorphic">).
      This allows the function to access its actual return type
      as shown in <xref linkend="plpgsql-declaration-type">.
      <literal>$0</literal> is initialized to null and can be modified by
      the function, so it can be used to hold the return value if desired,
      though that is not required.  <literal>$0</literal> can also be
      given an alias.  For example, this function works on any data type
      that has a <literal>+</> operator:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION add_three_values(v1 anyelement, v2 anyelement, v3 anyelement)
RETURNS anyelement AS $$
DECLARE
    result ALIAS FOR $0;
BEGIN
    result := v1 + v2 + v3;
    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      The same effect can be had by declaring one or more output parameters as
      polymorphic types.  In this case the
      special <literal>$0</literal> parameter is not used; the output
      parameters themselves serve the same purpose.  For example:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION add_three_values(v1 anyelement, v2 anyelement, v3 anyelement,
                                 OUT sum anyelement)
AS $$
BEGIN
    sum := v1 + v2 + v3;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
     </para>
    </sect2>

  <sect2 id="plpgsql-declaration-alias">
   <title><literal>ALIAS</></title>

<synopsis>
<replaceable>newname</> ALIAS FOR <replaceable>oldname</>;
</synopsis>

   <para>
    The <literal>ALIAS</> syntax is more general than is suggested in the
    previous section: you can declare an alias for any variable, not just
    function parameters.  The main practical use for this is to assign
    a different name for variables with predetermined names, such as
    <varname>NEW</varname> or <varname>OLD</varname> within
    a trigger procedure.
   </para>

   <para>
    Examples:
<programlisting>
DECLARE
  prior ALIAS FOR old;
  updated ALIAS FOR new;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Since <literal>ALIAS</> creates two different ways to name the same
    object, unrestricted use can be confusing.  It's best to use it only
    for the purpose of overriding predetermined names.
   </para>
   </sect2>

  <sect2 id="plpgsql-declaration-type">
   <title>Copying Types</title>

<synopsis>
<replaceable>variable</replaceable>%TYPE
</synopsis>

   <para>
    <literal>%TYPE</literal> provides the data type of a variable or
    table column. You can use this to declare variables that will hold
    database values. For example, let's say you have a column named
    <literal>user_id</literal> in your <literal>users</literal>
    table. To declare a variable with the same data type as
    <literal>users.user_id</> you write:
<programlisting>
user_id users.user_id%TYPE;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    By using <literal>%TYPE</literal> you don't need to know the data
    type of the structure you are referencing, and most importantly,
    if the data type of the referenced item changes in the future (for
    instance: you change the type of <literal>user_id</>
    from <type>integer</type> to <type>real</type>), you might not need
    to change your function definition.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>%TYPE</literal> is particularly valuable in polymorphic
    functions, since the data types needed for internal variables can
    change from one call to the next.  Appropriate variables can be
    created by applying <literal>%TYPE</literal> to the function's
    arguments or result placeholders.
   </para>

  </sect2>

    <sect2 id="plpgsql-declaration-rowtypes">
     <title>Row Types</title>

<synopsis>
<replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>table_name</replaceable><literal>%ROWTYPE</literal>;
<replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>composite_type_name</replaceable>;
</synopsis>

   <para>
    A variable of a composite type is called a <firstterm>row</>
    variable (or <firstterm>row-type</> variable).  Such a variable
    can hold a whole row of a <command>SELECT</> or <command>FOR</>
    query result, so long as that query's column set matches the
    declared type of the variable.
    The individual fields of the row value
    are accessed using the usual dot notation, for example
    <literal>rowvar.field</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    A row variable can be declared to have the same type as the rows of
    an existing table or view, by using the
    <replaceable>table_name</replaceable><literal>%ROWTYPE</literal>
    notation; or it can be declared by giving a composite type's name.
    (Since every table has an associated composite type of the same name,
    it actually does not matter in <productname>PostgreSQL</> whether you
    write <literal>%ROWTYPE</literal> or not.  But the form with
    <literal>%ROWTYPE</literal> is more portable.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Parameters to a function can be
    composite types (complete table rows). In that case, the
    corresponding identifier <literal>$<replaceable>n</replaceable></> will be a row variable, and fields can
    be selected from it, for example <literal>$1.user_id</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Only the user-defined columns of a table row are accessible in a
    row-type variable, not the OID or other system columns (because the
    row could be from a view).  The fields of the row type inherit the
    table's field size or precision for data types such as
    <type>char(<replaceable>n</>)</type>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example of using composite types.  <structname>table1</>
    and <structname>table2</> are existing tables having at least the
    mentioned fields:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION merge_fields(t_row table1) RETURNS text AS $$
DECLARE

   <para>
    Record variables are similar to row-type variables, but they have no
    predefined structure.  They take on the actual row structure of the
    row they are assigned during a <command>SELECT</> or <command>FOR</> command.  The substructure
    of a record variable can change each time it is assigned to.
    A consequence of this is that until a record variable is first assigned
    to, it has no substructure, and any attempt to access a
    field in it will draw a run-time error.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that <literal>RECORD</> is not a true data type, only a placeholder.
    One should also realize that when a <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
    function is declared to return type <type>record</>, this is not quite the
    same concept as a record variable, even though such a function might
    use a record variable to hold its result.  In both cases the actual row
    structure is unknown when the function is written, but for a function
    returning <type>record</> the actual structure is determined when the
    calling query is parsed, whereas a record variable can change its row
    structure on-the-fly.

   <title>Collation of <application>PL/pgSQL</application> Variables</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>collation</>
    <secondary>in PL/pgSQL</>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    When a <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function has one or more
    parameters of collatable data types, a collation is identified for each
    function call depending on the collations assigned to the actual
    arguments, as described in <xref linkend="collation">.  If a collation is
    successfully identified (i.e., there are no conflicts of implicit
    collations among the arguments) then all the collatable parameters are
    treated as having that collation implicitly.  This will affect the
    behavior of collation-sensitive operations within the function.
    For example, consider

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION less_than(a text, b text) RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN a &lt; b;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

SELECT less_than(text_field_1, text_field_2) FROM table1;
SELECT less_than(text_field_1, text_field_2 COLLATE "C") FROM table1;
</programlisting>

    The first use of <function>less_than</> will use the common collation
    of <structfield>text_field_1</> and <structfield>text_field_2</> for
    the comparison, while the second use will use <literal>C</> collation.
   </para>

   <para>
    Furthermore, the identified collation is also assumed as the collation of
    any local variables that are of collatable types.  Thus this function
    would not work any differently if it were written as

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION less_than(a text, b text) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    local_a text := a;
    local_b text := b;
BEGIN
    RETURN local_a &lt; local_b;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    If there are no parameters of collatable data types, or no common
    collation can be identified for them, then parameters and local variables
    use the default collation of their data type (which is usually the
    database's default collation, but could be different for variables of
    domain types).
   </para>

   <para>
    A local variable of a collatable data type can have a different collation
    associated with it by including the <literal>COLLATE</> option in its
    declaration, for example

<programlisting>
DECLARE
    local_a text COLLATE "en_US";
</programlisting>

    This option overrides the collation that would otherwise be
    given to the variable according to the rules above.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also, of course explicit <literal>COLLATE</> clauses can be written inside
    a function if it is desired to force a particular collation to be used in
    a particular operation.  For example,

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION less_than_c(a text, b text) RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN a &lt; b COLLATE "C";
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

    This overrides the collations associated with the table columns,
    parameters, or local variables used in the expression, just as would
    happen in a plain SQL command.

  <title>Expressions</title>

    <para>
     All expressions used in <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
     statements are processed using the server's main
     <acronym>SQL</acronym> executor.  For example, when you write
     a <application>PL/pgSQL</application> statement like
<synopsis>
IF <replaceable>expression</replaceable> THEN ...
</synopsis>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> will evaluate the expression by
     feeding a query like
<synopsis>
SELECT <replaceable>expression</replaceable>
</synopsis>
     to the main SQL engine.  While forming the <command>SELECT</> command,
     any occurrences of <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variable names
     are replaced by parameters, as discussed in detail in
     <xref linkend="plpgsql-var-subst">.
     This allows the query plan for the <command>SELECT</command> to
     be prepared just once and then reused for subsequent
     evaluations with different values of the variables.  Thus, what
     really happens on first use of an expression is essentially a
     <command>PREPARE</> command.  For example, if we have declared
     two integer variables <literal>x</> and <literal>y</>, and we write
<programlisting>
IF x &lt; y THEN ...
</programlisting>
     what happens behind the scenes is equivalent to
<programlisting>
PREPARE <replaceable>statement_name</>(integer, integer) AS SELECT $1 &lt; $2;
</programlisting>
     and then this prepared statement is <command>EXECUTE</>d for each
     execution of the <command>IF</> statement, with the current values
     of the <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variables supplied as
     parameter values.  Normally these details are
     not important to a <application>PL/pgSQL</application> user, but
     they are useful to know when trying to diagnose a problem.

    In this section and the following ones, we describe all the statement
    types that are explicitly understood by
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application>.
    Anything not recognized as one of these statement types is presumed
    to be an SQL command and is sent to the main database engine to execute,
    as described in <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-sql-noresult">
    and <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-sql-onerow">.

    <para>
     An assignment of a value to a <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
     variable is written as:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>variable</replaceable> { := | = } <replaceable>expression</replaceable>;
</synopsis>
     As explained previously, the expression in such a statement is evaluated
     by means of an SQL <command>SELECT</> command sent to the main
     database engine.  The expression must yield a single value (possibly
     a row value, if the variable is a row or record variable).  The target
     variable can be a simple variable (optionally qualified with a block
     name), a field of a row or record variable, or an element of an array
     that is a simple variable or field.  Equal (<literal>=</>) can be
     used instead of PL/SQL-compliant <literal>:=</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     If the expression's result data type doesn't match the variable's
     data type, the value will be coerced as though by an assignment cast
     (see <xref linkend="typeconv-query">).  If no assignment cast is known
     for the pair of data types involved, the <application>PL/pgSQL</>
     interpreter will attempt to convert the result value textually, that is
     by applying the result type's output function followed by the variable
     type's input function.  Note that this could result in run-time errors
     generated by the input function, if the string form of the result value
     is not acceptable to the input function.

     For any SQL command that does not return rows, for example

     just by writing the command.

     Any <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variable name appearing

    <para>
     When executing a SQL command in this way,

     plan for the command, as discussed in
     <xref linkend="plpgsql-plan-caching">.
    </para>

    <para>
     Sometimes it is useful to evaluate an expression or <command>SELECT</>
     query but discard the result, for example when calling a function
     that has side-effects but no useful result value.  To do
     this in <application>PL/pgSQL</application>, use the
     <command>PERFORM</command> statement:

<synopsis>
PERFORM <replaceable>query</replaceable>;
</synopsis>

     This executes <replaceable>query</replaceable> and discards the
     result.  Write the <replaceable>query</replaceable> the same
     way you would write an SQL <command>SELECT</> command, but replace the
     initial keyword <command>SELECT</> with <command>PERFORM</command>.
     For <command>WITH</> queries, use <command>PERFORM</> and then
     place the query in parentheses.  (In this case, the query can only
     return one row.)
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variables will be
     substituted into the query just as for commands that return no result,
     and the plan is cached in the same way.  Also, the special variable
     <literal>FOUND</literal> is set to true if the query produced at
     least one row, or false if it produced no rows (see
     <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-diagnostics">).
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      One might expect that writing <command>SELECT</command> directly
      would accomplish this result, but at
      present the only accepted way to do it is
      <command>PERFORM</command>.  A SQL command that can return rows,
      such as <command>SELECT</command>, will be rejected as an error

    <para>
     The result of a SQL command yielding a single row (possibly of multiple
     columns) can be assigned to a record variable, row-type variable, or list
     of scalar variables.  This is done by writing the base SQL command and
     adding an <literal>INTO</> clause.  For example,

<synopsis>
SELECT <replaceable>select_expressions</replaceable> INTO <optional>STRICT</optional> <replaceable>target</replaceable> FROM ...;
INSERT ... RETURNING <replaceable>expressions</replaceable> INTO <optional>STRICT</optional> <replaceable>target</replaceable>;
UPDATE ... RETURNING <replaceable>expressions</replaceable> INTO <optional>STRICT</optional> <replaceable>target</replaceable>;
DELETE ... RETURNING <replaceable>expressions</replaceable> INTO <optional>STRICT</optional> <replaceable>target</replaceable>;
</synopsis>

     where <replaceable>target</replaceable> can be a record variable, a row
     variable, or a comma-separated list of simple variables and
     record/row fields.
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variables will be
     substituted into the rest of the query, and the plan is cached,
     just as described above for commands that do not return rows.
     This works for <command>SELECT</>,
     <command>INSERT</>/<command>UPDATE</>/<command>DELETE</> with
     <literal>RETURNING</>, and utility commands that return row-set
     results (such as <command>EXPLAIN</>).
     Except for the <literal>INTO</> clause, the SQL command is the same
     as it would be written outside <application>PL/pgSQL</application>.
    </para>

   <tip>
    <para>
     Note that this interpretation of <command>SELECT</> with <literal>INTO</>
     is quite different from <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s regular
     <command>SELECT INTO</command> command, wherein the <literal>INTO</>
     target is a newly created table.  If you want to create a table from a
     <command>SELECT</> result inside a
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function, use the syntax
     <command>CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT</command>.
    </para>
   </tip>

    <para>
     If a row or a variable list is used as target, the query's result columns
     must exactly match the structure of the target as to number and data
     types, or else a run-time error
     occurs.  When a record variable is the target, it automatically
     configures itself to the row type of the query result columns.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <literal>INTO</> clause can appear almost anywhere in the SQL
     command.  Customarily it is written either just before or just after
     the list of <replaceable>select_expressions</replaceable> in a
     <command>SELECT</> command, or at the end of the command for other
     command types.  It is recommended that you follow this convention
     in case the <application>PL/pgSQL</application> parser becomes
     stricter in future versions.
    </para>

    <para>
     If <literal>STRICT</literal> is not specified in the <literal>INTO</>
     clause, then <replaceable>target</replaceable> will be set to the first
     row returned by the query, or to nulls if the query returned no rows.
     (Note that <quote>the first row</> is not
     well-defined unless you've used <literal>ORDER BY</>.)  Any result rows
     after the first row are discarded.
     You can check the special <literal>FOUND</literal> variable (see
     <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-diagnostics">) to
     determine whether a row was returned:

<programlisting>
SELECT * INTO myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'employee % not found', myname;
END IF;
</programlisting>

     If the <literal>STRICT</literal> option is specified, the query must
     return exactly one row or a run-time error will be reported, either
     <literal>NO_DATA_FOUND</> (no rows) or <literal>TOO_MANY_ROWS</>
     (more than one row). You can use an exception block if you wish
     to catch the error, for example:

<programlisting>
BEGIN
    SELECT * INTO STRICT myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'employee % not found', myname;
        WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'employee % not unique', myname;
END;
</programlisting>
     Successful execution of a command with <literal>STRICT</>
     always sets <literal>FOUND</literal> to true.
    </para>

    <para>
     For <command>INSERT</>/<command>UPDATE</>/<command>DELETE</> with
     <literal>RETURNING</>, <application>PL/pgSQL</application> reports
     an error for more than one returned row, even when
     <literal>STRICT</literal> is not specified.  This is because there
     is no option such as <literal>ORDER BY</> with which to determine
     which affected row should be returned.
    </para>

    <para>
     If <literal>print_strict_params</> is enabled for the function,
     then when an error is thrown because the requirements
     of <literal>STRICT</> are not met, the <literal>DETAIL</> part of
     the error message will include information about the parameters
     passed to the query.
     You can change the <literal>print_strict_params</>
     setting for all functions by setting
     <varname>plpgsql.print_strict_params</>, though only subsequent
     function compilations will be affected.  You can also enable it
     on a per-function basis by using a compiler option, for example:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION get_userid(username text) RETURNS int
AS $$
#print_strict_params on
DECLARE
userid int;
BEGIN
    SELECT users.userid INTO STRICT userid
        FROM users WHERE users.username = get_userid.username;
    RETURN userid;
END
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
     On failure, this function might produce an error message such as
<programlisting>
ERROR:  query returned no rows
DETAIL:  parameters: $1 = 'nosuchuser'
CONTEXT:  PL/pgSQL function get_userid(text) line 6 at SQL statement
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <title>Executing Dynamic Commands</title>

    <para>
     Oftentimes you will want to generate dynamic commands inside your
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> functions, that is, commands
     that will involve different tables or different data types each
     time they are executed.  <application>PL/pgSQL</application>'s
     normal attempts to cache plans for commands (as discussed in
     <xref linkend="plpgsql-plan-caching">) will not work in such
     scenarios.  To handle this sort of problem, the
     <command>EXECUTE</command> statement is provided:

<synopsis>
EXECUTE <replaceable class="command">command-string</replaceable> <optional> INTO <optional>STRICT</optional> <replaceable>target</replaceable> </optional> <optional> USING <replaceable>expression</replaceable> <optional>, ... </optional> </optional>;
</synopsis>

     where <replaceable>command-string</replaceable> is an expression
     yielding a string (of type <type>text</type>) containing the
     command to be executed.  The optional <replaceable>target</replaceable>
     is a record variable, a row variable, or a comma-separated list of
     simple variables and record/row fields, into which the results of
     the command will be stored.  The optional <literal>USING</> expressions
     supply values to be inserted into the command.
    </para>

    <para>
     No substitution of <application>PL/pgSQL</> variables is done on the
     computed command string.  Any required variable values must be inserted
     in the command string as it is constructed; or you can use parameters
     as described below.
    </para>

    <para>
     Also, there is no plan caching for commands executed via
     <command>EXECUTE</command>.  Instead, the command is always planned
     each time the statement is run. Thus the command
     string can be dynamically created within the function to perform
     actions on different tables and columns.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <literal>INTO</literal> clause specifies where the results of
     a SQL command returning rows should be assigned. If a row
     or variable list is provided, it must exactly match the structure
     of the query's results (when a
     record variable is used, it will configure itself to match the
     result structure automatically). If multiple rows are returned,
     only the first will be assigned to the <literal>INTO</literal>
     variable. If no rows are returned, NULL is assigned to the
     <literal>INTO</literal> variable(s). If no <literal>INTO</literal>
     clause is specified, the query results are discarded.
    </para>

    <para>
     If the <literal>STRICT</> option is given, an error is reported
     unless the query produces exactly one row.
    </para>

    <para>
     The command string can use parameter values, which are referenced
     in the command as <literal>$1</>, <literal>$2</>, etc.
     These symbols refer to values supplied in the <literal>USING</>
     clause.  This method is often preferable to inserting data values
     into the command string as text: it avoids run-time overhead of
     converting the values to text and back, and it is much less prone
     to SQL-injection attacks since there is no need for quoting or escaping.
     An example is:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE 'SELECT count(*) FROM mytable WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2'
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that parameter symbols can only be used for data values
     &mdash; if you want to use dynamically determined table or column
     names, you must insert them into the command string textually.
     For example, if the preceding query needed to be done against a
     dynamically selected table, you could do this:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE 'SELECT count(*) FROM '
    || quote_ident(tabname)
    || ' WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2'
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;
</programlisting>
     A cleaner approach is to use <function>format()</>'s <literal>%I</>
     specification for table or column names (strings separated by a
     newline are concatenated):
<programlisting>
EXECUTE format('SELECT count(*) FROM %I '
   'WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2', tabname)
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;
</programlisting>
     Another restriction on parameter symbols is that they only work in
     <command>SELECT</>, <command>INSERT</>, <command>UPDATE</>, and
     <command>DELETE</> commands.  In other statement
     types (generically called utility statements), you must insert
     values textually even if they are just data values.
    </para>

    <para>
     An <command>EXECUTE</> with a simple constant command string and some
     <literal>USING</> parameters, as in the first example above, is
     functionally equivalent to just writing the command directly in
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> and allowing replacement of
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> variables to happen automatically.
     The important difference is that <command>EXECUTE</> will re-plan
     the command on each execution, generating a plan that is specific
     to the current parameter values; whereas
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> may otherwise create a generic plan
     and cache it for re-use.  In situations where the best plan depends
     strongly on the parameter values, it can be helpful to use
     <command>EXECUTE</> to positively ensure that a generic plan is not
     selected.
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>SELECT INTO</command> is not currently supported within
     <command>EXECUTE</command>; instead, execute a plain <command>SELECT</>
     command and specify <literal>INTO</> as part of the <command>EXECUTE</>
     itself.
    </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
     <command>EXECUTE</command> statement is not related to the

    <para>
     When working with dynamic commands you will often have to handle escaping
     of single quotes.  The recommended method for quoting fixed text in your
     function body is dollar quoting.  (If you have legacy code that does
     not use dollar quoting, please refer to the
     overview in <xref linkend="plpgsql-quote-tips">, which can save you
     some effort when translating said code to a more reasonable scheme.)
    </para>

    <para>
     Dynamic values require careful handling since they might contain
     quote characters.
     An example using <function>format()</> (this assumes that you are
     dollar quoting the function body so quote marks need not be doubled):
<programlisting>
EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = $1 '
   'WHERE key = $2', colname) USING newvalue, keyvalue;
</programlisting>
     It is also possible to call the quoting functions directly:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = '
        || quote_literal(newvalue)
        || ' WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     This example demonstrates the use of the
     <function>quote_ident</function> and
     <function>quote_literal</function> functions (see <xref
     linkend="functions-string">).  For safety, expressions containing column
     or table identifiers should be passed through
     <function>quote_ident</function> before insertion in a dynamic query.
     Expressions containing values that should be literal strings in the
     constructed command should be passed through <function>quote_literal</>.
     These functions take the appropriate steps to return the input text
     enclosed in double or single quotes respectively, with any embedded
     special characters properly escaped.
    </para>

    <para>
     Because <function>quote_literal</function> is labeled
     <literal>STRICT</literal>, it will always return null when called with a
     null argument.  In the above example, if <literal>newvalue</> or
     <literal>keyvalue</> were null, the entire dynamic query string would
     become null, leading to an error from <command>EXECUTE</command>.
     You can avoid this problem by using the <function>quote_nullable</>
     function, which works the same as <function>quote_literal</> except that
     when called with a null argument it returns the string <literal>NULL</>.
     For example,
<programlisting>
EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = '
        || quote_nullable(newvalue)
        || ' WHERE key = '
        || quote_nullable(keyvalue);
</programlisting>
     If you are dealing with values that might be null, you should usually
     use <function>quote_nullable</> in place of <function>quote_literal</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     As always, care must be taken to ensure that null values in a query do
     not deliver unintended results.  For example the <literal>WHERE</> clause
<programlisting>
'WHERE key = ' || quote_nullable(keyvalue)
</programlisting>
     will never succeed if <literal>keyvalue</> is null, because the
     result of using the equality operator <literal>=</> with a null operand
     is always null.  If you wish null to work like an ordinary key value,
     you would need to rewrite the above as
<programlisting>
'WHERE key IS NOT DISTINCT FROM ' || quote_nullable(keyvalue)
</programlisting>
     (At present, <literal>IS NOT DISTINCT FROM</> is handled much less
     efficiently than <literal>=</>, so don't do this unless you must.
     See <xref linkend="functions-comparison"> for
     more information on nulls and <literal>IS DISTINCT</>.)
    </para>

    <para>
     Note that dollar quoting is only useful for quoting fixed text.
     It would be a very bad idea to try to write this example as:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = $$'
        || newvalue
        || '$$ WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);
</programlisting>
     because it would break if the contents of <literal>newvalue</>
     happened to contain <literal>$$</>.  The same objection would
     apply to any other dollar-quoting delimiter you might pick.
     So, to safely quote text that is not known in advance, you
     <emphasis>must</> use <function>quote_literal</>,
     <function>quote_nullable</>, or <function>quote_ident</>, as appropriate.
    </para>

    <para>
     Dynamic SQL statements can also be safely constructed using the
     <function>format</function> function (see <xref
     linkend="functions-string">). For example:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = %L '
   'WHERE key = %L', colname, newvalue, keyvalue);
</programlisting>
     <literal>%I</> is equivalent to <function>quote_ident</>, and
     <literal>%L</> is equivalent to <function>quote_nullable</function>.
     The <function>format</function> function can be used in conjunction with
     the <literal>USING</literal> clause:
<programlisting>
EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = $1 WHERE key = $2', colname)
   USING newvalue, keyvalue;
</programlisting>
     This form is better because the variables are handled in their native
     data type format, rather than unconditionally converting them to
     text and quoting them via <literal>%L</>.  It is also more efficient.
    </para>
   </example>

    <para>
     A much larger example of a dynamic command and
     <command>EXECUTE</command> can be seen in <xref
     linkend="plpgsql-porting-ex2">, which builds and executes a
     <command>CREATE FUNCTION</> command to define a new function.

   <sect2 id="plpgsql-statements-diagnostics">
    <title>Obtaining the Result Status</title>

    <para>
     There are several ways to determine the effect of a command. The
     first method is to use the <command>GET DIAGNOSTICS</command>
     command, which has the form:

<synopsis>
GET <optional> CURRENT </optional> DIAGNOSTICS <replaceable>variable</replaceable> { = | := } <replaceable>item</replaceable> <optional> , ... </optional>;
</synopsis>

     This command allows retrieval of system status indicators.
     <literal>CURRENT</> is a noise word (but see also <command>GET STACKED
     DIAGNOSTICS</command> in <xref linkend="plpgsql-exception-diagnostics">).
     Each <replaceable>item</replaceable> is a key word identifying a status
     value to be assigned to the specified <replaceable>variable</replaceable>
     (which should be of the right data type to receive it).  The currently
     available status items are shown
     in <xref linkend="plpgsql-current-diagnostics-values">.  Colon-equal
     (<literal>:=</>) can be used instead of the SQL-standard <literal>=</>
     token.  An example:
<programlisting>
GET DIAGNOSTICS integer_var = ROW_COUNT;
</programlisting>
    </para>

     <table id="plpgsql-current-diagnostics-values">

    <para>
     The second method to determine the effects of a command is to check the
     special variable named <literal>FOUND</literal>, which is of
     type <type>boolean</type>.  <literal>FOUND</literal> starts out
     false within each <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function call.
     It is set by each of the following types of statements:

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
           <para>
            A <command>MOVE</> statement sets <literal>FOUND</literal>

          <listitem>
           <para>
            A <command>FOR</> or <command>FOREACH</> statement sets
            <literal>FOUND</literal> true
            if it iterates one or more times, else false.
            <literal>FOUND</literal> is set this way when the
            loop exits; inside the execution of the loop,
            <literal>FOUND</literal> is not modified by the
            loop statement, although it might be changed by the
            execution of other statements within the loop body.

            true if the query returns at least one row, false if no row
            is returned.
           </para>
          </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

     Other <application>PL/pgSQL</application> statements do not change
     the state of <literal>FOUND</literal>.
     Note in particular that <command>EXECUTE</command>
     changes the output of <command>GET DIAGNOSTICS</command>, but
     does not change <literal>FOUND</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
     <literal>FOUND</literal> is a local variable within each
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function; any changes to it
     affect only the current function.

    <title>Doing Nothing At All</title>

    <para>
     Sometimes a placeholder statement that does nothing is useful.
     For example, it can indicate that one arm of an if/then/else
     chain is deliberately empty.  For this purpose, use the
     <command>NULL</command> statement:

<synopsis>
NULL;
</synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     For example, the following two fragments of code are equivalent:
<programlisting>
BEGIN
    y := x / 0;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero THEN
        NULL;  -- ignore the error
END;
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
BEGIN
    y := x / 0;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero THEN  -- ignore the error

     Which is preferable is a matter of taste.

    <note>
     <para>
      In Oracle's PL/SQL, empty statement lists are not allowed, and so

     There are two commands available that allow you to return data

    </para>

    <sect3>
     <title><command>RETURN</></title>

<synopsis>
RETURN <replaceable>expression</replaceable>;
</synopsis>

     <para>
      <command>RETURN</command> with an expression terminates the
      function and returns the value of
      <replaceable>expression</replaceable> to the caller.  This form
      is used for <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions that do
      not return a set.
     </para>

     <para>
      In a function that returns a scalar type, the expression's result will
      automatically be cast into the function's return type as described for
      assignments.  But to return a composite (row) value, you must write an
      expression delivering exactly the requested column set.  This may
      require use of explicit casting.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you declared the function with output parameters, write just
      <command>RETURN</command> with no expression.  The current values
      of the output parameter variables will be returned.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you declared the function to return <type>void</type>, a
      <command>RETURN</command> statement can be used to exit the function
      early; but do not write an expression following
      <command>RETURN</command>.
     </para>

     <para>
      The return value of a function cannot be left undefined. If
      control reaches the end of the top-level block of the function
      without hitting a <command>RETURN</command> statement, a run-time
      error will occur.  This restriction does not apply to functions
      with output parameters and functions returning <type>void</type>,
      however.  In those cases a <command>RETURN</command> statement is
      automatically executed if the top-level block finishes.
     </para>

     <para>
      Some examples:

<programlisting>

     <para>
      When a <application>PL/pgSQL</> function is declared to return
      <literal>SETOF <replaceable>sometype</></literal>, the procedure
      to follow is slightly different.  In that case, the individual
      items to return are specified by a sequence of <command>RETURN
      NEXT</command> or <command>RETURN QUERY</command> commands, and
      then a final <command>RETURN</command> command with no argument
      is used to indicate that the function has finished executing.
      <command>RETURN NEXT</command> can be used with both scalar and
      composite data types; with a composite result type, an entire
      <quote>table</quote> of results will be returned.
      <command>RETURN QUERY</command> appends the results of executing
      a query to the function's result set. <command>RETURN
      NEXT</command> and <command>RETURN QUERY</command> can be freely
      intermixed in a single set-returning function, in which case
      their results will be concatenated.
     </para>

     <para>
      <command>RETURN NEXT</command> and <command>RETURN
      QUERY</command> do not actually return from the function &mdash;
      they simply append zero or more rows to the function's result
      set.  Execution then continues with the next statement in the
      <application>PL/pgSQL</> function.  As successive
      <command>RETURN NEXT</command> or <command>RETURN
      QUERY</command> commands are executed, the result set is built
      up.  A final <command>RETURN</command>, which should have no
      argument, causes control to exit the function (or you can just
      let control reach the end of the function).
     </para>

     <para>
      <command>RETURN QUERY</command> has a variant
      <command>RETURN QUERY EXECUTE</command>, which specifies the
      query to be executed dynamically.  Parameter expressions can
      be inserted into the computed query string via <literal>USING</>,
      in just the same way as in the <command>EXECUTE</> command.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you declared the function with output parameters, write just
      <command>RETURN NEXT</command> with no expression.  On each
      execution, the current values of the output parameter
      variable(s) will be saved for eventual return as a row of the
      result.  Note that you must declare the function as returning
      <literal>SETOF record</literal> when there are multiple output
      parameters, or <literal>SETOF <replaceable>sometype</></literal>
      when there is just one output parameter of type
      <replaceable>sometype</>, in order to create a set-returning
      function with output parameters.

      <para>
       The current implementation of <command>RETURN NEXT</command>
       and <command>RETURN QUERY</command> stores the entire result set
       before returning from the function, as discussed above.  That
       means that if a <application>PL/pgSQL</> function produces a
       very large result set, performance might be poor: data will be
       written to disk to avoid memory exhaustion, but the function
       itself will not return until the entire result set has been
       generated.  A future version of <application>PL/pgSQL</> might
       allow users to define set-returning functions
       that do not have this limitation.  Currently, the point at
       which data begins being written to disk is controlled by the
       <xref linkend="guc-work-mem">
       configuration variable.  Administrators who have sufficient
       memory to store larger result sets in memory should consider
       increasing this parameter.

       <para>
        Sometimes there are more than just two alternatives.
        <literal>IF-THEN-ELSIF</> provides a convenient
        method of checking several alternatives in turn.
        The <literal>IF</> conditions are tested successively
        until the first one that is true is found.  Then the
        associated statement(s) are executed, after which control
        passes to the next statement after <literal>END IF</>.
        (Any subsequent <literal>IF</> conditions are <emphasis>not</>
        tested.)  If none of the <literal>IF</> conditions is true,
        then the <literal>ELSE</> block (if any) is executed.
       </para>

       <para>
        Here is an example:

<programlisting>
IF number = 0 THEN
    result := 'zero';
ELSIF number &gt; 0 THEN
    result := 'positive';
ELSIF number &lt; 0 THEN
    result := 'negative';
ELSE
    -- hmm, the only other possibility is that number is null
    result := 'NULL';
END IF;
</programlisting>
       </para>

       <para>
        The key word <literal>ELSIF</> can also be spelled
        <literal>ELSEIF</>.
       </para>

       <para>
        An alternative way of accomplishing the same task is to nest
        <literal>IF-THEN-ELSE</literal> statements, as in the
        following example:

<programlisting>
IF demo_row.sex = 'm' THEN
    pretty_sex := 'man';
ELSE
    IF demo_row.sex = 'f' THEN
        pretty_sex := 'woman';
    END IF;
END IF;
</programlisting>
       </para>

       <para>
        However, this method requires writing a matching <literal>END IF</>
        for each <literal>IF</>, so it is much more cumbersome than
        using <literal>ELSIF</> when there are many alternatives.

      <para>
       The searched form of <command>CASE</> provides conditional execution

       then control passes to the next statement after <literal>END CASE</>.
       (Subsequent <literal>WHEN</> expressions are not evaluated.)
       If no true result is found, the <literal>ELSE</>
       <replaceable>statements</replaceable> are executed;

       This form of <command>CASE</> is entirely equivalent to

     Using a different type of <literal>FOR</> loop, you can iterate through

     The <replaceable>target</replaceable> is a record variable, row variable,
     or comma-separated list of scalar variables.
     The <replaceable>target</replaceable> is successively assigned each row
     resulting from the <replaceable>query</replaceable> and the loop body is
     executed for each row. Here is an example:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION cs_refresh_mviews() RETURNS integer AS $$

    RAISE NOTICE 'Refreshing materialized views...';

    FOR mviews IN SELECT * FROM cs_materialized_views ORDER BY sort_key LOOP

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

     If the loop is terminated by an <literal>EXIT</> statement, the last
     assigned row value is still accessible after the loop.

    <para>
     The <replaceable>query</replaceable> used in this type of <literal>FOR</>
     statement can be any SQL command that returns rows to the caller:
     <command>SELECT</> is the most common case,

     <command>DELETE</> with a <literal>RETURNING</> clause.  Some utility

    </para>

    <para>
     <application>PL/pgSQL</> variables are substituted into the query text,

</synopsis>
     This is like the previous form, except that the source query
     is specified as a string expression, which is evaluated and replanned
     on each entry to the <literal>FOR</> loop.  This allows the programmer to
     choose the speed of a preplanned query or the flexibility of a dynamic
     query, just as with a plain <command>EXECUTE</command> statement.
     As with <command>EXECUTE</command>, parameter values can be inserted
     into the dynamic command via <literal>USING</>.

   <sect2 id="plpgsql-foreach-array">
    <title>Looping Through Arrays</title>

    <para>
     The <literal>FOREACH</> loop is much like a <literal>FOR</> loop,
     but instead of iterating through the rows returned by a SQL query,
     it iterates through the elements of an array value.
     (In general, <literal>FOREACH</> is meant for looping through
     components of a composite-valued expression; variants for looping
     through composites besides arrays may be added in future.)
     The <literal>FOREACH</> statement to loop over an array is:

<synopsis>
<optional> &lt;&lt;<replaceable>label</replaceable>&gt;&gt; </optional>
FOREACH <replaceable>target</replaceable> <optional> SLICE <replaceable>number</replaceable> </optional> IN ARRAY <replaceable>expression</replaceable> LOOP
    <replaceable>statements</replaceable>
END LOOP <optional> <replaceable>label</replaceable> </optional>;
</synopsis>
    </para>

    <para>
     Without <literal>SLICE</>, or if <literal>SLICE 0</> is specified,
     the loop iterates through individual elements of the array produced
     by evaluating the <replaceable>expression</replaceable>.
     The <replaceable>target</replaceable> variable is assigned each
     element value in sequence, and the loop body is executed for each element.
     Here is an example of looping through the elements of an integer
     array:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION sum(int[]) RETURNS int8 AS $$
DECLARE
  s int8 := 0;
  x int;
BEGIN
  FOREACH x IN ARRAY $1
  LOOP
    s := s + x;
  END LOOP;
  RETURN s;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

     The elements are visited in storage order, regardless of the number of
     array dimensions.  Although the <replaceable>target</replaceable> is
     usually just a single variable, it can be a list of variables when
     looping through an array of composite values (records).  In that case,
     for each array element, the variables are assigned from successive
     columns of the composite value.
    </para>

    <para>
     With a positive <literal>SLICE</> value, <literal>FOREACH</>
     iterates through slices of the array rather than single elements.
     The <literal>SLICE</> value must be an integer constant not larger
     than the number of dimensions of the array.  The
     <replaceable>target</replaceable> variable must be an array,
     and it receives successive slices of the array value, where each slice
     is of the number of dimensions specified by <literal>SLICE</>.
     Here is an example of iterating through one-dimensional slices:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION scan_rows(int[]) RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  x int[];
BEGIN
  FOREACH x SLICE 1 IN ARRAY $1
  LOOP
    RAISE NOTICE 'row = %', x;
  END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    <para>
     If no error occurs, this form of block simply executes all the
     <replaceable>statements</replaceable>, and then control passes
     to the next statement after <literal>END</>.  But if an error
     occurs within the <replaceable>statements</replaceable>, further
     processing of the <replaceable>statements</replaceable> is
     abandoned, and control passes to the <literal>EXCEPTION</> list.
     The list is searched for the first <replaceable>condition</replaceable>
     matching the error that occurred.  If a match is found, the
     corresponding <replaceable>handler_statements</replaceable> are
     executed, and then control passes to the next statement after
     <literal>END</>.  If no match is found, the error propagates out
     as though the <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause were not there at all:
     the error can be caught by an enclosing block with
     <literal>EXCEPTION</>, or if there is none it aborts processing
     of the function.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <replaceable>condition</replaceable> names can be any of
     those shown in <xref linkend="errcodes-appendix">.  A category
     name matches any error within its category.  The special
     condition name <literal>OTHERS</> matches every error type except
     <literal>QUERY_CANCELED</> and <literal>ASSERT_FAILURE</>.
     (It is possible, but often unwise, to trap those two error types
     by name.)  Condition names are
     not case-sensitive.  Also, an error condition can be specified
     by <literal>SQLSTATE</> code; for example these are equivalent:
<programlisting>
WHEN division_by_zero THEN ...
WHEN SQLSTATE '22012' THEN ...
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     If a new error occurs within the selected
     <replaceable>handler_statements</replaceable>, it cannot be caught
     by this <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause, but is propagated out.
     A surrounding <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause could catch it.
    </para>

    <para>
     When an error is caught by an <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause,
     the local variables of the <application>PL/pgSQL</> function
     remain as they were when the error occurred, but all changes
     to persistent database state within the block are rolled back.
     As an example, consider this fragment:

<programlisting>
INSERT INTO mytab(firstname, lastname) VALUES('Tom', 'Jones');
BEGIN
    UPDATE mytab SET firstname = 'Joe' WHERE lastname = 'Jones';
    x := x + 1;
    y := x / 0;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'caught division_by_zero';
        RETURN x;
END;
</programlisting>

     When control reaches the assignment to <literal>y</>, it will
     fail with a <literal>division_by_zero</> error.  This will be caught by
     the <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause.  The value returned in the
     <command>RETURN</> statement will be the incremented value of
     <literal>x</>, but the effects of the <command>UPDATE</> command will
     have been rolled back.  The <command>INSERT</> command preceding the
     block is not rolled back, however, so the end result is that the database
     contains <literal>Tom Jones</> not <literal>Joe Jones</>.
    </para>

    <tip>
     <para>
      A block containing an <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause is significantly
      more expensive to enter and exit than a block without one.  Therefore,
      don't use <literal>EXCEPTION</> without need.
     </para>

    <title>Exceptions with <command>UPDATE</>/<command>INSERT</></title>
    <para>

    This example uses exception handling to perform either
    <command>UPDATE</> or <command>INSERT</>, as appropriate.  It is
    recommended that applications use <command>INSERT</> with
    <literal>ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE</> rather than actually using
    this pattern.  This example serves primarily to illustrate use of
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application> control flow structures:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE db (a INT PRIMARY KEY, b TEXT);

CREATE FUNCTION merge_db(key INT, data TEXT) RETURNS VOID AS
$$
BEGIN
    LOOP
        -- first try to update the key
        UPDATE db SET b = data WHERE a = key;
        IF found THEN
            RETURN;
        END IF;
        -- not there, so try to insert the key
        -- if someone else inserts the same key concurrently,
        -- we could get a unique-key failure
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO db(a,b) VALUES (key, data);
            RETURN;
        EXCEPTION WHEN unique_violation THEN
            -- Do nothing, and loop to try the UPDATE again.
        END;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

SELECT merge_db(1, 'david');
SELECT merge_db(1, 'dennis');
</programlisting>

     This coding assumes the <literal>unique_violation</> error is caused by
     the <command>INSERT</>, and not by, say, an <command>INSERT</> in a
     trigger function on the table.  It might also misbehave if there is
     more than one unique index on the table, since it will retry the
     operation regardless of which index caused the error.
     More safety could be had by using the
     features discussed next to check that the trapped error was the one
     expected.

    <title>Obtaining Information About an Error</title>

    <para>
     Exception handlers frequently need to identify the specific error that
     occurred.  There are two ways to get information about the current

     <command>GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS</command> command.
    </para>

    <para>
     Within an exception handler, the special variable
     <varname>SQLSTATE</varname> contains the error code that corresponds to
     the exception that was raised (refer to <xref linkend="errcodes-table">
     for a list of possible error codes). The special variable
     <varname>SQLERRM</varname> contains the error message associated with the
     exception. These variables are undefined outside exception handlers.
    </para>

    <para>
     Within an exception handler, one may also retrieve
     information about the current exception by using the
     <command>GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS</command> command, which has the form:

<synopsis>
GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS <replaceable>variable</replaceable> { = | := } <replaceable>item</replaceable> <optional> , ... </optional>;
</synopsis>

     Each <replaceable>item</replaceable> is a key word identifying a status
     value to be assigned to the specified <replaceable>variable</replaceable>
     (which should be of the right data type to receive it).  The currently

    Rather than executing a whole query at once, it is possible to set
    up a <firstterm>cursor</> that encapsulates the query, and then read
    the query result a few rows at a time. One reason for doing this is
    to avoid memory overrun when the result contains a large number of
    rows. (However, <application>PL/pgSQL</> users do not normally need
    to worry about that, since <literal>FOR</> loops automatically use a cursor
    internally to avoid memory problems.) A more interesting usage is to
    return a reference to a cursor that a function has created, allowing the
    caller to read the rows. This provides an efficient way to return
    large row sets from functions.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="plpgsql-cursor-declarations">
    <title>Declaring Cursor Variables</title>

    <para>
     All access to cursors in <application>PL/pgSQL</> goes through
     cursor variables, which are always of the special data type
     <type>refcursor</>.  One way to create a cursor variable
     is just to declare it as a variable of type <type>refcursor</>.
     Another way is to use the cursor declaration syntax,
     which in general is:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>name</replaceable> <optional> <optional> NO </optional> SCROLL </optional> CURSOR <optional> ( <replaceable>arguments</replaceable> ) </optional> FOR <replaceable>query</replaceable>;
</synopsis>
     (<literal>FOR</> can be replaced by <literal>IS</> for
     <productname>Oracle</productname> compatibility.)
     If <literal>SCROLL</> is specified, the cursor will be capable of
     scrolling backward; if <literal>NO SCROLL</> is specified, backward
     fetches will be rejected; if neither specification appears, it is
     query-dependent whether backward fetches will be allowed.
     <replaceable>arguments</replaceable>, if specified, is a
     comma-separated list of pairs <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
     <replaceable>datatype</replaceable></literal> that define names to be
     replaced by parameter values in the given query.  The actual
     values to substitute for these names will be specified later,
     when the cursor is opened.
    </para>
    <para>
     Some examples:
<programlisting>
DECLARE
    curs1 refcursor;
    curs2 CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM tenk1;
    curs3 CURSOR (key integer) FOR SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 = key;
</programlisting>
     All three of these variables have the data type <type>refcursor</>,
     but the first can be used with any query, while the second has
     a fully specified query already <firstterm>bound</> to it, and the last
     has a parameterized query bound to it.  (<literal>key</> will be
     replaced by an integer parameter value when the cursor is opened.)
     The variable <literal>curs1</>
     is said to be <firstterm>unbound</> since it is not bound to
     any particular query.

     three forms of the <command>OPEN</> statement, two of which use unbound

        variable names are substituted, and the query plan is cached for
        possible reuse.  When a <application>PL/pgSQL</>
        variable is substituted into the cursor query, the value that is

          from one run to the next (see <xref linkend="plpgsql-plan-caching">),

         </para>

         <para>
          The query plan for a bound cursor is always considered cacheable;
          there is no equivalent of <command>EXECUTE</command> in this case.
          Notice that <literal>SCROLL</> and <literal>NO SCROLL</> cannot be

          Argument values can be passed using either <firstterm>positional</firstterm>
          or <firstterm>named</firstterm> notation.  In positional
          notation, all arguments are specified in order.  In named notation,
          each argument's name is specified using <literal>:=</literal> to
          separate it from the argument expression. Similar to calling
          functions, described in <xref linkend="sql-syntax-calling-funcs">, it

         <para>
          Because variable substitution is done on a bound cursor's query,
          there are really two ways to pass values into the cursor: either
          with an explicit argument to <command>OPEN</>, or implicitly by
          referencing a <application>PL/pgSQL</> variable in the query.
          However, only variables declared before the bound cursor was
          declared will be substituted into it.  In either case the value to
          be passed is determined at the time of the <command>OPEN</>.
          For example, another way to get the same effect as the
          <literal>curs3</> example above is
<programlisting>
DECLARE
    key integer;

     Once a cursor has been opened, it can be manipulated with the

    </para>

    <para>
     These manipulations need not occur in the same function that

     <title>Returning Cursors</title>

       <para>
        <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions can return cursors to the
        caller. This is useful to return multiple rows or columns,
        especially with very large result sets.  To do this, the function
        opens the cursor and returns the cursor name to the caller (or simply
        opens the cursor using a portal name specified by or otherwise known
        to the caller).  The caller can then fetch rows from the cursor. The
        cursor can be closed by the caller, or it will be closed automatically
        when the transaction closes.
       </para>

       <para>
        The portal name used for a cursor can be specified by the
        programmer or automatically generated.  To specify a portal name,
        simply assign a string to the <type>refcursor</> variable before
        opening it.  The string value of the <type>refcursor</> variable
        will be used by <command>OPEN</> as the name of the underlying portal.
        However, if the <type>refcursor</> variable is null,
        <command>OPEN</> automatically generates a name that does not
        conflict with any existing portal, and assigns it to the
        <type>refcursor</> variable.
       </para>

       <note>
        <para>
         A bound cursor variable is initialized to the string value
         representing its name, so that the portal name is the same as
         the cursor variable name, unless the programmer overrides it
         by assignment before opening the cursor.  But an unbound cursor
         variable defaults to the null value initially, so it will receive
         an automatically-generated unique name, unless overridden.
        </para>
       </note>

       <para>
        The following example shows one way a cursor name can be supplied by
        the caller:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE test (col text);
INSERT INTO test VALUES ('123');

CREATE FUNCTION reffunc(refcursor) RETURNS refcursor AS '
BEGIN
    OPEN $1 FOR SELECT col FROM test;
    RETURN $1;
END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

BEGIN;
SELECT reffunc('funccursor');
FETCH ALL IN funccursor;
COMMIT;
</programlisting>
       </para>

       <para>
        The following example uses automatic cursor name generation:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION reffunc2() RETURNS refcursor AS '
DECLARE
    ref refcursor;
BEGIN
    OPEN ref FOR SELECT col FROM test;
    RETURN ref;
END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- need to be in a transaction to use cursors.
BEGIN;
SELECT reffunc2();

      reffunc2
--------------------
 &lt;unnamed cursor 1&gt;
(1 row)

FETCH ALL IN "&lt;unnamed cursor 1&gt;";
COMMIT;
</programlisting>
       </para>

       <para>
        The following example shows one way to return multiple cursors
        from a single function:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION myfunc(refcursor, refcursor) RETURNS SETOF refcursor AS $$
BEGIN
    OPEN $1 FOR SELECT * FROM table_1;
    RETURN NEXT $1;
    OPEN $2 FOR SELECT * FROM table_2;
    RETURN NEXT $2;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- need to be in a transaction to use cursors.
BEGIN;

SELECT * FROM myfunc('a', 'b');

FETCH ALL FROM a;
FETCH ALL FROM b;
COMMIT;

   <sect2 id="plpgsql-cursor-for-loop">
    <title>Looping Through a Cursor's Result</title>

    <para>
     There is a variant of the <command>FOR</> statement that allows
     iterating through the rows returned by a cursor.  The syntax is:

<synopsis>
<optional> &lt;&lt;<replaceable>label</replaceable>&gt;&gt; </optional>
FOR <replaceable>recordvar</replaceable> IN <replaceable>bound_cursorvar</replaceable> <optional> ( <optional> <replaceable>argument_name</replaceable> := </optional> <replaceable>argument_value</replaceable> <optional>, ...</optional> ) </optional> LOOP
    <replaceable>statements</replaceable>
END LOOP <optional> <replaceable>label</replaceable> </optional>;
</synopsis>

     The cursor variable must have been bound to some query when it was
     declared, and it <emphasis>cannot</> be open already.  The
     <command>FOR</> statement automatically opens the cursor, and it closes
     the cursor again when the loop exits.  A list of actual argument value
     expressions must appear if and only if the cursor was declared to take
     arguments.  These values will be substituted in the query, in just
     the same way as during an <command>OPEN</> (see <xref
     linkend="plpgsql-open-bound-cursor">).
   </para>

   <para>
     The variable <replaceable>recordvar</replaceable> is automatically
     defined as type <type>record</> and exists only inside the loop (any
     existing definition of the variable name is ignored within the loop).
     Each row returned by the cursor is successively assigned to this
     record variable and the loop body is executed.

    The <replaceable class="parameter">level</replaceable> option specifies

    <literal>LOG</literal>, <literal>INFO</literal>,
    <literal>NOTICE</literal>, <literal>WARNING</literal>,
    and <literal>EXCEPTION</literal>, with <literal>EXCEPTION</literal>
    being the default.
    <literal>EXCEPTION</literal> raises an error (which normally aborts the

    Whether messages of a particular priority are reported to the client,

   <para>
    After <replaceable class="parameter">level</replaceable> if any,
    you can write a <replaceable class="parameter">format</replaceable>
    (which must be a simple string literal, not an expression).  The
    format string specifies the error message text to be reported.
    The format string can be followed

    Inside the format string, <literal>%</literal> is replaced by the
    string representation of the next optional argument's value. Write
    <literal>%%</literal> to emit a literal <literal>%</literal>.
    The number of arguments must match the number of <literal>%</>
    placeholders in the format string, or an error is raised during
    the compilation of the function.
   </para>

   <para>
    In this example, the value of <literal>v_job_id</> will replace the

<programlisting>
RAISE NOTICE 'Calling cs_create_job(%)', v_job_id;

    This example will abort the transaction with the given error message
    and hint:
<programlisting>
RAISE EXCEPTION 'Nonexistent ID --> %', user_id
      USING HINT = 'Please check your user ID';
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    These two examples show equivalent ways of setting the SQLSTATE:
<programlisting>
RAISE 'Duplicate user ID: %', user_id USING ERRCODE = 'unique_violation';
RAISE 'Duplicate user ID: %', user_id USING ERRCODE = '23505';
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    There is a second <command>RAISE</> syntax in which the main argument
    is the condition name or SQLSTATE to be reported, for example:
<programlisting>
RAISE division_by_zero;
RAISE SQLSTATE '22012';
</programlisting>
    In this syntax, <literal>USING</> can be used to supply a custom
    error message, detail, or hint.  Another way to do the earlier
    example is
<programlisting>
RAISE unique_violation USING MESSAGE = 'Duplicate user ID: ' || user_id;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Still another variant is to write <literal>RAISE USING</> or <literal>RAISE
    <replaceable class="parameter">level</replaceable> USING</> and put
    everything else into the <literal>USING</> list.
   </para>

   <para>
    The last variant of <command>RAISE</> has no parameters at all.
    This form can only be used inside a <literal>BEGIN</> block's
    <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause;
    it causes the error currently being handled to be re-thrown.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Before <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.1, <command>RAISE</> without
     parameters was interpreted as re-throwing the error from the block
     containing the active exception handler.  Thus an <literal>EXCEPTION</>
     clause nested within that handler could not catch it, even if the
     <command>RAISE</> was within the nested <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause's
     block. This was deemed surprising as well as being incompatible with
     Oracle's PL/SQL.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    If no condition name nor SQLSTATE is specified in a
    <command>RAISE EXCEPTION</command> command, the default is to use
    <literal>RAISE_EXCEPTION</> (<literal>P0001</>).  If no message
    text is specified, the default is to use the condition name or
    SQLSTATE as message text.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     When specifying an error code by SQLSTATE code, you are not
     limited to the predefined error codes, but can select any
     error code consisting of five digits and/or upper-case ASCII
     letters, other than <literal>00000</>.  It is recommended that
     you avoid throwing error codes that end in three zeroes, because
     these are category codes and can only be trapped by trapping
     the whole category.

   <para>
    A trigger function must return either <symbol>NULL</symbol> or a
    record/row value having exactly the structure of the table the
    trigger was fired for.
   </para>

   <para>
    Row-level triggers fired <literal>BEFORE</> can return null to signal the
    trigger manager to skip the rest of the operation for this row
    (i.e., subsequent triggers are not fired, and the
    <command>INSERT</>/<command>UPDATE</>/<command>DELETE</> does not occur
    for this row).  If a nonnull
    value is returned then the operation proceeds with that row value.
    Returning a row value different from the original value
    of <varname>NEW</> alters the row that will be inserted or
    updated.  Thus, if the trigger function wants the triggering
    action to succeed normally without altering the row
    value, <varname>NEW</varname> (or a value equal thereto) has to be
    returned.  To alter the row to be stored, it is possible to
    replace single values directly in <varname>NEW</> and return the
    modified <varname>NEW</>, or to build a complete new record/row to
    return.  In the case of a before-trigger
    on <command>DELETE</command>, the returned value has no direct
    effect, but it has to be nonnull to allow the trigger action to
    proceed.  Note that <varname>NEW</varname> is null
    in <command>DELETE</command> triggers, so returning that is
    usually not sensible.  The usual idiom in <command>DELETE</command>
    triggers is to return <varname>OLD</varname>.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>INSTEAD OF</> triggers (which are always row-level triggers,
    and may only be used on views) can return null to signal that they did
    not perform any updates, and that the rest of the operation for this
    row should be skipped (i.e., subsequent triggers are not fired, and the
    row is not counted in the rows-affected status for the surrounding
    <command>INSERT</>/<command>UPDATE</>/<command>DELETE</>).
    Otherwise a nonnull value should be returned, to signal
    that the trigger performed the requested operation. For
    <command>INSERT</> and <command>UPDATE</> operations, the return value
    should be <varname>NEW</>, which the trigger function may modify to
    support <command>INSERT RETURNING</> and <command>UPDATE RETURNING</>
    (this will also affect the row value passed to any subsequent triggers,
    or passed to a special <varname>EXCLUDED</> alias reference within
    an <command>INSERT</> statement with an <literal>ON CONFLICT DO
    UPDATE</> clause).  For <command>DELETE</> operations, the return
    value should be <varname>OLD</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The return value of a row-level trigger
    fired <literal>AFTER</literal> or a statement-level trigger
    fired <literal>BEFORE</> or <literal>AFTER</> is
    always ignored; it might as well be null. However, any of these types of
    triggers might still abort the entire operation by raising an error.

    One use of triggers is to maintain a summary table
    of another table. The resulting summary can be used in place of the
    original table for certain queries &mdash; often with vastly reduced run
    times.
    This technique is commonly used in Data Warehousing, where the tables
    of measured or observed data (called fact tables) might be extremely large.

   <title>Variable Substitution</title>

   <para>
    SQL statements and expressions within a <application>PL/pgSQL</> function
    can refer to variables and parameters of the function.  Behind the scenes,
    <application>PL/pgSQL</> substitutes query parameters for such references.
    Parameters will only be substituted in places where a parameter or
    column reference is syntactically allowed.  As an extreme case, consider
    this example of poor programming style:
<programlisting>
INSERT INTO foo (foo) VALUES (foo);
</programlisting>
    The first occurrence of <literal>foo</> must syntactically be a table
    name, so it will not be substituted, even if the function has a variable
    named <literal>foo</>.  The second occurrence must be the name of a
    column of the table, so it will not be substituted either.  Only the
    third occurrence is a candidate to be a reference to the function's
    variable.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> versions before 9.0 would try
     to substitute the variable in all three cases, leading to syntax errors.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Since the names of variables are syntactically no different from the names
    of table columns, there can be ambiguity in statements that also refer to
    tables: is a given name meant to refer to a table column, or a variable?
    Let's change the previous example to
<programlisting>
INSERT INTO dest (col) SELECT foo + bar FROM src;
</programlisting>
    Here, <literal>dest</> and <literal>src</> must be table names, and
    <literal>col</> must be a column of <literal>dest</>, but <literal>foo</>
    and <literal>bar</> might reasonably be either variables of the function
    or columns of <literal>src</>.

    By default, <application>PL/pgSQL</> will report an error if a name
    in a SQL statement could refer to either a variable or a table column.
    You can fix such a problem by renaming the variable or column,
    or by qualifying the ambiguous reference, or by telling
    <application>PL/pgSQL</> which interpretation to prefer.
   </para>

   <para>
    The simplest solution is to rename the variable or column.
    A common coding rule is to use a
    different naming convention for <application>PL/pgSQL</application>
    variables than you use for column names.  For example,
    if you consistently name function variables
    <literal>v_<replaceable>something</></literal> while none of your
    column names start with <literal>v_</>, no conflicts will occur.
   </para>

   <para>
    Alternatively you can qualify ambiguous references to make them clear.
    In the above example, <literal>src.foo</> would be an unambiguous reference
    to the table column.  To create an unambiguous reference to a variable,
    declare it in a labeled block and use the block's label
    (see <xref linkend="plpgsql-structure">).  For example,
<programlisting>
&lt;&lt;block&gt;&gt;
DECLARE
    foo int;
BEGIN
    foo := ...;
    INSERT INTO dest (col) SELECT block.foo + bar FROM src;
</programlisting>
    Here <literal>block.foo</> means the variable even if there is a column
    <literal>foo</> in <literal>src</>.  Function parameters, as well as
    special variables such as <literal>FOUND</>, can be qualified by the
    function's name, because they are implicitly declared in an outer block
    labeled with the function's name.
   </para>

   <para>
    Sometimes it is impractical to fix all the ambiguous references in a
    large body of <application>PL/pgSQL</> code.  In such cases you can
    specify that <application>PL/pgSQL</> should resolve ambiguous references
    as the variable (which is compatible with <application>PL/pgSQL</>'s
    behavior before <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.0), or as the
    table column (which is compatible with some other systems such as
    <productname>Oracle</productname>).
   </para>

   <indexterm>
     <primary><varname>plpgsql.variable_conflict</> configuration parameter</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    To change this behavior on a system-wide basis, set the configuration
    parameter <literal>plpgsql.variable_conflict</> to one of
    <literal>error</>, <literal>use_variable</>, or
    <literal>use_column</> (where <literal>error</> is the factory default).
    This parameter affects subsequent compilations
    of statements in <application>PL/pgSQL</> functions, but not statements
    already compiled in the current session.
    Because changing this setting
    can cause unexpected changes in the behavior of <application>PL/pgSQL</>
    functions, it can only be changed by a superuser.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can also set the behavior on a function-by-function basis, by
    inserting one of these special commands at the start of the function
    text:
<programlisting>
#variable_conflict error
#variable_conflict use_variable
#variable_conflict use_column
</programlisting>
    These commands affect only the function they are written in, and override
    the setting of <literal>plpgsql.variable_conflict</>.  An example is
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION stamp_user(id int, comment text) RETURNS void AS $$
    #variable_conflict use_variable
    DECLARE
        curtime timestamp := now();
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET last_modified = curtime, comment = comment
          WHERE users.id = id;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
    In the <literal>UPDATE</> command, <literal>curtime</>, <literal>comment</>,
    and <literal>id</> will refer to the function's variable and parameters
    whether or not <literal>users</> has columns of those names.  Notice
    that we had to qualify the reference to <literal>users.id</> in the
    <literal>WHERE</> clause to make it refer to the table column.
    But we did not have to qualify the reference to <literal>comment</>
    as a target in the <literal>UPDATE</> list, because syntactically
    that must be a column of <literal>users</>.  We could write the same
    function without depending on the <literal>variable_conflict</> setting
    in this way:
<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION stamp_user(id int, comment text) RETURNS void AS $$
    &lt;&lt;fn&gt;&gt;
    DECLARE
        curtime timestamp := now();
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET last_modified = fn.curtime, comment = stamp_user.comment
          WHERE users.id = stamp_user.id;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Variable substitution does not happen in the command string given
    to <command>EXECUTE</> or one of its variants.  If you need to
    insert a varying value into such a command, do so as part of
    constructing the string value, or use <literal>USING</>, as illustrated in
    <xref linkend="plpgsql-statements-executing-dyn">.
   </para>

   <para>
    Variable substitution currently works only in <command>SELECT</>,
    <command>INSERT</>, <command>UPDATE</>, and <command>DELETE</> commands,
    because the main SQL engine allows query parameters only in these
    commands.  To use a non-constant name or value in other statement
    types (generically called utility statements), you must construct
    the utility statement as a string and <command>EXECUTE</> it.

   <para>
    The <application>PL/pgSQL</> interpreter parses the function's source
    text and produces an internal binary instruction tree the first time the
    function is called (within each session).  The instruction tree
    fully translates the
    <application>PL/pgSQL</> statement structure, but individual
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> expressions and <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands
    used in the function are not translated immediately.
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm>
     <primary>preparing a query</>
     <secondary>in PL/pgSQL</>
    </indexterm>
    As each expression and <acronym>SQL</acronym> command is first
    executed in the function, the <application>PL/pgSQL</> interpreter
    parses and analyzes the command to create a prepared statement,
    using the <acronym>SPI</acronym> manager's
    <function>SPI_prepare</function> function.
    Subsequent visits to that expression or command
    reuse the prepared statement.  Thus, a function with conditional code
    paths that are seldom visited will never incur the overhead of
    analyzing those commands that are never executed within the current
    session.  A disadvantage is that errors
    in a specific expression or command cannot be detected until that
    part of the function is reached in execution.  (Trivial syntax
    errors will be detected during the initial parsing pass, but
    anything deeper will not be detected until execution.)
   </para>

   <para>
    <application>PL/pgSQL</> (or more precisely, the SPI manager) can
    furthermore attempt to cache the execution plan associated with any
    particular prepared statement.  If a cached plan is not used, then
    a fresh execution plan is generated on each visit to the statement,
    and the current parameter values (that is, <application>PL/pgSQL</>
    variable values) can be used to optimize the selected plan.  If the
    statement has no parameters, or is executed many times, the SPI manager
    will consider creating a <firstterm>generic</> plan that is not dependent
    on specific parameter values, and caching that for re-use.  Typically
    this will happen only if the execution plan is not very sensitive to
    the values of the <application>PL/pgSQL</> variables referenced in it.
    If it is, generating a plan each time is a net win.  See <xref
    linkend="sql-prepare"> for more information about the behavior of
    prepared statements.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because <application>PL/pgSQL</application> saves prepared statements
    and sometimes execution plans in this way,
    SQL commands that appear directly in a
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application> function must refer to the
    same tables and columns on every execution; that is, you cannot use
    a parameter as the name of a table or column in an SQL command.  To get
    around this restriction, you can construct dynamic commands using
    the <application>PL/pgSQL</application> <command>EXECUTE</command>
    statement &mdash; at the price of performing new parse analysis and
    constructing a new execution plan on every execution.
   </para>

    <para>
     The mutable nature of record variables presents another problem in this
     connection.  When fields of a record variable are used in
     expressions or statements, the data types of the fields must not
     change from one call of the function to the next, since each
     expression will be analyzed using the data type that is present
     when the expression is first reached.  <command>EXECUTE</command> can be
     used to get around this problem when necessary.
    </para>

    <para>
     If the same function is used as a trigger for more than one table,
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> prepares and caches statements
     independently for each such table &mdash; that is, there is a cache
     for each trigger function and table combination, not just for each
     function.  This alleviates some of the problems with varying
     data types; for instance, a trigger function will be able to work
     successfully with a column named <literal>key</> even if it happens
     to have different types in different tables.
    </para>

    <para>
     Likewise, functions having polymorphic argument types have a separate
     statement cache for each combination of actual argument types they have
     been invoked for, so that data type differences do not cause unexpected
     failures.
    </para>

   <para>
    Statement caching can sometimes have surprising effects on the
    interpretation of time-sensitive values.  For example there
    is a difference between what these two functions do:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION logfunc1(logtxt text) RETURNS void AS $$
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO logtable VALUES (logtxt, 'now');
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>

     and:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION logfunc2(logtxt text) RETURNS void AS $$
    DECLARE
        curtime timestamp;
    BEGIN
        curtime := 'now';
        INSERT INTO logtable VALUES (logtxt, curtime);
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     In the case of <function>logfunc1</function>, the
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> main parser knows when
     analyzing the <command>INSERT</command> that the
     string <literal>'now'</literal> should be interpreted as
     <type>timestamp</type>, because the target column of
     <classname>logtable</classname> is of that type. Thus,
     <literal>'now'</literal> will be converted to a <type>timestamp</type>
     constant when the
     <command>INSERT</command> is analyzed, and then used in all
     invocations of <function>logfunc1</function> during the lifetime
     of the session. Needless to say, this isn't what the programmer
     wanted.  A better idea is to use the <literal>now()</> or
     <literal>current_timestamp</> function.
    </para>

    <para>
     In the case of <function>logfunc2</function>, the
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> main parser does not know
     what type <literal>'now'</literal> should become and therefore
     it returns a data value of type <type>text</type> containing the string
     <literal>now</literal>. During the ensuing assignment
     to the local variable <varname>curtime</varname>, the
     <application>PL/pgSQL</application> interpreter casts this
     string to the <type>timestamp</type> type by calling the
     <function>text_out</function> and <function>timestamp_in</function>
     functions for the conversion.  So, the computed time stamp is updated
     on each execution as the programmer expects.  Even though this
     happens to work as expected, it's not terribly efficient, so
     use of the <literal>now()</> function would still be a better idea.

  <title>Tips for Developing in <application>PL/pgSQL</application></title>

   <para>
    One good way to develop in
    <application>PL/pgSQL</> is to use the text editor of your
    choice to create your functions, and in another window, use
    <application>psql</application> to load and test those functions.
    If you are doing it this way, it
    is a good idea to write the function using <command>CREATE OR
    REPLACE FUNCTION</>. That way you can just reload the file to update
    the function definition.  For example:
<programlisting>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION testfunc(integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
          ....
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    While running <application>psql</application>, you can load or reload such
    a function definition file with:
<programlisting>
\i filename.sql
</programlisting>
    and then immediately issue SQL commands to test the function.
   </para>

   <para>
    Another good way to develop in <application>PL/pgSQL</> is with a
    GUI database access tool that facilitates development in a
    procedural language. One example of such a tool is
    <application>pgAdmin</>, although others exist. These tools often
    provide convenient features such as escaping single quotes and
    making it easier to recreate and debug functions.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="plpgsql-quote-tips">
   <title>Handling of Quotation Marks</title>

   <para>
    The code of a <application>PL/pgSQL</> function is specified in
    <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command> as a string literal.  If you
    write the string literal in the ordinary way with surrounding
    single quotes, then any single quotes inside the function body
    must be doubled; likewise any backslashes must be doubled (assuming
    escape string syntax is used).
    Doubling quotes is at best tedious, and in more complicated cases
    the code can become downright incomprehensible, because you can
    easily find yourself needing half a dozen or more adjacent quote marks.
    It's recommended that you instead write the function body as a
    <quote>dollar-quoted</> string literal (see <xref
    linkend="sql-syntax-dollar-quoting">).  In the dollar-quoting
    approach, you never double any quote marks, but instead take care to
    choose a different dollar-quoting delimiter for each level of
    nesting you need.  For example, you might write the <command>CREATE
    FUNCTION</command> command as:
<programlisting>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION testfunc(integer) RETURNS integer AS $PROC$
          ....
$PROC$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</programlisting>
    Within this, you might use quote marks for simple literal strings in
    SQL commands and <literal>$$</> to delimit fragments of SQL commands
    that you are assembling as strings.  If you need to quote text that
    includes <literal>$$</>, you could use <literal>$Q$</>, and so on.
   </para>

    The following chart shows what you have to do when writing quote

       If a name used in a SQL command could be either a column name of a

     Here is an <productname>Oracle</productname> <application>PL/SQL</> function:
<programlisting>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cs_fmt_browser_version(v_name varchar,

     Let's go through this function and see the differences compared to
     <application>PL/pgSQL</>:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The <literal>RETURN</literal> key word in the function
        prototype (not the function body) becomes
        <literal>RETURNS</literal> in
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
        Also, <literal>IS</> becomes <literal>AS</>, and you need to
        add a <literal>LANGUAGE</> clause because <application>PL/pgSQL</>
        is not the only possible function language.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        In <productname>PostgreSQL</>, the function body is considered
        to be a string literal, so you need to use quote marks or dollar
        quotes around it.  This substitutes for the terminating <literal>/</>
        in the Oracle approach.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        The <literal>show errors</literal> command does not exist in

     Notice how the body of the function is built separately and passed
     through <literal>quote_literal</> to double any quote marks in it.  This
     technique is needed because we cannot safely use dollar quoting for
     defining the new function: we do not know for sure what strings will
     be interpolated from the <structfield>referrer_key.key_string</> field.
     (We are assuming here that <structfield>referrer_key.kind</> can be
     trusted to always be <literal>host</>, <literal>domain</>, or
     <literal>url</>, but <structfield>referrer_key.key_string</> might be
     anything, in particular it might contain dollar signs.) This function
     is actually an improvement on the Oracle original, because it will
     not generate broken code when <structfield>referrer_key.key_string</> or
     <structfield>referrer_key.referrer_type</> contain quote marks.

   <sect3 id="plpgsql-porting-exceptions">
    <title>Implicit Rollback after Exceptions</title>

    <para>
     In <application>PL/pgSQL</>, when an exception is caught by an
     <literal>EXCEPTION</> clause, all database changes since the block's
     <literal>BEGIN</> are automatically rolled back.  That is, the behavior

<programlisting>
BEGIN
    SAVEPOINT s1;

EXCEPTION

        ... code here ...
END;
</programlisting>

     If you are translating an Oracle procedure that uses
     <command>SAVEPOINT</> and <command>ROLLBACK TO</> in this style,
     your task is easy: just omit the <command>SAVEPOINT</> and
     <command>ROLLBACK TO</>.  If you have a procedure that uses
