  <para>
   <application>libpq</application> is the <acronym>C</acronym>
   application programmer's interface to
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  <application>libpq</application> is a set
   of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> backend server and to receive the
   results of these queries.  <application>libpq</application> is also the
   underlying engine for several other <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   application interfaces, including <application>libpq++</application> (C++),
   <application>libpgtcl</application> (Tcl), <productname>Perl</productname>, and
   <application>ECPG</application>.  So some aspects of <application>libpq</>'s behavior will be
   important to you if you use one of those packages.
  </para>

  <para>
   Three short programs are included at the end of this chapter (<xref linkend="libpq-example">) to show how
   to write programs that use <application>libpq</application>.  There are also several
   complete examples of <application>libpq</application> applications in the
   directory <filename>src/test/examples</filename> in the source code distribution.
  </para>

  <para>
   Client programs that use <application>libpq</application> must include the
   header file <filename>libpq-fe.h</filename> and must link with the
   <application>libpq</application> library.

  <title>Database Connection Functions</title>

  <para>
   The following functions deal with making a connection to a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> backend server.  An
   application program can have several backend connections open at
   one time.  (One reason to do that is to access more than one
   database.)  Each connection is represented by a
   <structname>PGconn</> object which is obtained from the function
   <function>PQconnectdb</> or <function>PQsetdbLogin</>.  Note that
   these functions will always return a non-null object pointer,
   unless perhaps there is too little memory even to allocate the
   <structname>PGconn</> object.  The <function>PQstatus</> function
   should be called to check whether a connection was successfully
   made before queries are sent via the connection object.

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><function>PQconnectdb</function></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Makes a new connection to the database server.
<synopsis>
PGconn *PQconnectdb(const char *conninfo);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
   This function opens a new database connection using the parameters taken
   from the string <literal>conninfo</literal>.  Unlike <function>PQsetdbLogin</> below,
   the parameter set can be extended without changing the function signature,
   so use either of this function or the nonblocking analogues <function>PQconnectStart</>
   and <function>PQconnectPoll</function> is preferred for new application programming.
   </para>

   <para>
   The passed string
   can be empty to use all default parameters, or it can contain one or more
   parameter settings separated by whitespace.
   Each parameter setting is in the form <literal>keyword = value</literal>.
   (To write an empty value or a value containing
   spaces, surround it with single quotes, e.g.,
   <literal>keyword = 'a value'</literal>.
   Single quotes and backslashes within the value must be escaped with a
   backslash, i.e., <literal>\'</literal> and <literal>\\</literal>.)
   Spaces around the equal sign are optional.
   </para>

   <para>
   The currently recognized parameter key words are:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>host</literal></term>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      Name of host to connect to. 
      If this begins with a slash, it specifies Unix-domain communication
      rather than TCP/IP communication; the value is the name of the
      directory in which the socket file is stored.
      The default is to connect to a Unix-domain socket in
      <filename>/tmp</filename>.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>hostaddr</literal></term>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      IP address of host to connect to.  This should be in the
      standard IPv4 address format, e.g., <literal>172.28.40.9</>.  If
      your machine supports IPv6, you can also use those addresses. If
      a nonzero-length string is specified, TCP/IP communication is
      used.
     </para>
     <para>
      Using <literal>hostaddr</> instead of <literal>host</> allows the
      application to avoid a host name look-up, which may be important in
      applications with time constraints. However, Kerberos authentication
      requires the host name. The following therefore applies: If
      <literal>host</> is specified without <literal>hostaddr</>, a host name
      lookup is forced. If <literal>hostaddr</> is specified without
      <literal>host</>, the value for <literal>hostaddr</> gives the remote
      address; if Kerberos is used, this causes a reverse name query. If both
      <literal>host</> and <literal>hostaddr</> are specified, the value for
      <literal>hostaddr</> gives the remote address; the value for
      <literal>host</> is ignored, unless Kerberos is used, in which case that
      value is used for Kerberos authentication. (Note that authentication is
      likely to fail if <application>libpq</application> is passed a host name
      that is not the name of the machine at <literal>hostaddr</>.)  Also,
      <literal>host</> rather than <literal>hostaddr</> is used to identify
      the connection in <filename>$HOME/.pgpass</>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Without either a host name or host address,
      <application>libpq</application> will connect using a
      local Unix domain socket.

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>service</literal></term>
     <listitem>
     <para>
      Service name to use for additional parameters.  It specifies a service
      name in <filename>pg_service.conf</filename> that holds additional connection parameters.
      This allows applications to specify only a service name so connection parameters 
      can be centrally maintained.  See

      information on how to set up the file.

   If  any  parameter is unspecified, then the corresponding

<para>
   These two functions are used to open a connection to a database server such
   that your application's thread of execution is not blocked on remote I/O
   whilst doing so.
  </para>
  <para>
   The database connection is made using the parameters taken from the string
   <literal>conninfo</literal>, passed to <function>PQconnectStart</function>. This string is in
   the same format as described above for <function>PQconnectdb</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Neither <function>PQconnectStart</function> nor <function>PQconnectPoll</function> will block, as long as a number of
   restrictions are met:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The <literal>hostaddr</> and <literal>host</> parameters are used appropriately to ensure that
      name and reverse name queries are not made. See the documentation of
      these parameters under <function>PQconnectdb</function> above for details.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you call <function>PQtrace</function>, ensure that the stream object into which you trace
      will not block.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You ensure for yourself that the socket is in the appropriate state
      before calling <function>PQconnectPoll</function>, as described below.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   To begin a nonblocking connection request, call <literal>conn = PQconnectStart("<replaceable>connection_info_string</>")</literal>.
   If <varname>conn</varname> is null, then <application>libpq</> has been unable to allocate a new <structname>PGconn</>
   structure. Otherwise, a valid <structname>PGconn</> pointer is returned (though not yet
   representing a valid connection to the database). On return from
   <function>PQconnectStart</function>, call <literal>status = PQstatus(conn)</literal>. If <varname>status</varname> equals
   <symbol>CONNECTION_BAD</symbol>, <function>PQconnectStart</function> has failed.
  </para>
  <para>
   If <function>PQconnectStart</> succeeds, the next stage is to poll <application>libpq</> so that it may
   proceed with the connection sequence.  Loop thus: If <function>PQconnectPoll(conn)</function> last returned
   <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_READING</symbol>, perform a <function>select()</> for reading on the socket determined using <function>PQsocket(conn)</function>. If
   it last returned <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_WRITING</symbol>, perform a <function>select()</> for writing on
   that same socket. If you have yet to call <function>PQconnectPoll</function>, i.e., after the call
   to <function>PQconnectStart</function>, behave as if it last returned <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_WRITING</symbol>.  If
   <function>select()</> shows that the socket is ready, consider it <quote>active</quote>. If it has
   been decided that this connection is <quote>active</quote>, call <function>PQconnectPoll(conn)</function>
   again. If this call returns <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_FAILED</symbol>, the connection procedure
   has failed.  If this call returns <symbol>PGRES_POLLING_OK</symbol>, the connection has been
   successfully made.
  </para>

  <para>
    Note that the use of <function>select()</function> to ensure that the socket is ready is merely
    a (likely) example; those with other facilities available, such as a
    <function>poll()</function> call, may of course use that instead.
  </para>

  <para>
    At any time during connection, the status of the connection may be
    checked, by calling <function>PQstatus</>. If this gives <symbol>CONNECTION_BAD</>, then the
    connection procedure has failed; if it gives <function>CONNECTION_OK</>, then the
    connection is ready.  Both of these states are equally detectable
    from the return value of <function>PQconnectPoll</>, described above. Other states may also occur
    during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These
    indicate the current stage of the connection procedure and may be useful
    to provide feedback to the user for example. These statuses are:

    </variablelist>

    Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain
    compatibility), an application should never rely upon these appearing in a
    particular order, or at all, or on the status always being one of these
    documented values. An application may do something like this:
<programlisting>
switch(PQstatus(conn))
{
    case CONNECTION_STARTED:
        feedback = "Connecting...";
        break;

    case CONNECTION_MADE:
        feedback = "Connected to server...";
        break;
.
.
.
    default:
        feedback = "Connecting...";
}
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Note that if <function>PQconnectStart</function> returns a non-null pointer, you must call
   <function>PQfinish</function> when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of
   the structure and any associated memory blocks. This must be done even if a
   call to <function>PQconnectStart</function> or <function>PQconnectPoll</function> failed.
  </para>

  <para>
   <function>PQconnectPoll</function> will currently block if
   <application>libpq</> is compiled with SSL support. This restriction may be removed in the future.
  </para>

  <para>
   Finally, these functions leave the connection in a nonblocking state as if 
   <function>PQsetnonblocking</function> had been called.

</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
   Returns a connection options array.  This may
   be used to determine all possible <function>PQconnectdb</function> options and their
   current default values.  The return value points to an array of
   <structname>PQconninfoOption</structname> structures, which ends with an entry having a null
   key-word pointer.  Note that the current default values (<structfield>val</structfield> fields)
   will depend on environment variables and other context.
   Callers must treat the connection options data as read-only.
   </para>

   <para>
    After processing the options array, free it by passing it to

<application>libpq</application> application programmers should be careful to
maintain the <structname>PGconn</structname> abstraction.  Use the accessor functions below to get
at the contents of <structname>PGconn</structname>.  Avoid directly referencing the fields of the

(Beginning in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> release 6.4, the
definition of the <type>struct</type> behind <structname>PGconn</> is not even provided in <filename>libpq-fe.h</filename>.
If you have old code that accesses <structname>PGconn</structname> fields directly, you can keep using it

      <para>
       The status can be one of a number of values.
       However, only two of these are
       seen outside of an asynchronous connection procedure:
       <literal>CONNECTION_OK</literal> and
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal>. A good
       connection to the database has the status <literal>CONNECTION_OK</literal>.
       A failed connection
       attempt is signaled by status
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal>.
       Ordinarily, an OK status will remain so until
       <function>PQfinish</function>, but a
       communications failure might result in the status changing to
       <literal>CONNECTION_BAD</literal> prematurely.
       In that case the application

<para>
If you want to use strings that have been received
from a source that is not trustworthy (for example, because a random user
entered them), you should not directly include them in SQL
commands for security reasons.  Instead, you have to escape certain
characters that are otherwise interpreted specially by the SQL parser.
<function>PQescapeString</> performs this operation.
</para>
<para>
The parameter <parameter>from</> points to the first character of the string that
is to be escaped, and the <parameter>length</> parameter counts the
number of characters in this string.  (A terminating zero byte is
neither necessary nor counted.)  <parameter>to</> shall point to a
buffer that is able to hold at least one more character than twice
the value of <parameter>length</>, otherwise the behavior is
undefined.  A call to <function>PQescapeString</> writes an escaped
version of the <parameter>from</> string to the <parameter>to</>
buffer, replacing special characters so that they cannot cause any
harm, and adding a terminating zero byte.  The single quotes that
must surround <productname>PostgreSQL</> string literals are not part of the result
string.

The <function>PQexec</function> function is adequate for submitting commands in
normal, synchronous

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQexec</function> waits for the command to be completed.  The application may have other
work to do (such as maintaining a user interface), in which case it won't
want to block waiting for the response.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Since the execution of the client application is suspended while it
waits for the result, it is hard for the application to decide that it
would like to try to cancel the ongoing command.  (It can be done from
a signal handler, but not otherwise.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<function>PQexec</function> can return only one <structname>PGresult</structname> structure.  If the submitted command
string contains multiple <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands, all but the last <structname>PGresult</structname> are
discarded by <function>PQexec</function>.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Applications that do not like these limitations can instead use the
underlying functions that <function>PQexec</function> is built from:
<function>PQsendQuery</function> and <function>PQgetResult</function>.
</para>
<para>
Older programs that used this functionality as well as 
<function>PQputline</function> and <function>PQputnbytes</function>
could block waiting to send data to the server. To
address that issue, the function <function>PQsetnonblocking</function>
was added.
Old applications can neglect to use <function>PQsetnonblocking</function>
and get the old potentially blocking behavior.  Newer programs can use 
<function>PQsetnonblocking</function> to achieve a completely nonblocking
connection to the server.

</para>

<para>
Using <function>PQsendQuery</function> and <function>PQgetResult</function>
solves one of <function>PQexec</function>'s problems:
If a command string contains multiple <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands, the results of those
commands can be obtained individually.  (This allows a simple form of
overlapped processing, by the way: the client can be handling the
results of one command while the server is still working on later
queries in the same command string.)  However, calling <function>PQgetResult</function> will
still cause the client to block until the server completes the
next <acronym>SQL</acronym> command.  This can be avoided by proper use of three more
functions:

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><function>PQconsumeInput</function></term>
<listitem>
<para>
	  If input is available from the server, consume it.
<synopsis>
int PQconsumeInput(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> normally returns 1 indicating <quote>no error</quote>,
but returns 0 if there was some kind of trouble (in which case
<function>PQerrorMessage</function> can be used).  Note that the result does not say
whether any input data was actually collected. After calling
<function>PQconsumeInput</function>, the application may check
<function>PQisBusy</function> and/or <function>PQnotifies</function> to see if
their state has changed.
</para>
<para>
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> may be called even if the application is not
prepared to deal with a result or notification just yet.  The
function will read available data and save it in a buffer, thereby
causing a <function>select()</function> read-ready indication to go away.  The
application can thus use <function>PQconsumeInput</function> to clear the
<function>select()</function> condition immediately, and then examine the results at leisure.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><function>PQisBusy</function></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Returns 1 if a command is busy, that is, <function>PQgetResult</function> would block
waiting for input.  A 0 return indicates that <function>PQgetResult</function> can
be called with assurance of not blocking.
<synopsis>
int PQisBusy(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
<function>PQisBusy</function> will not itself attempt to read data from the server;
therefore <function>PQconsumeInput</function> must be invoked first, or the busy
state will never end.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><function>PQflush</function></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Attempts to flush any data queued to the server.
Returns 0 if successful (or if the send queue is empty), -1 if it failed for
some reason, or 1 if it was unable to send all the data in the send queue yet
(this case can only occur if the connection is nonblocking).
<synopsis>
int PQflush(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
<function>PQflush</function> needs to be called on a nonblocking connection 
before calling <function>select()</function> to determine if a response has
arrived.  If 0 is returned it ensures that there is no data queued to the 
server that has not actually been sent.  Only applications that have used
<function>PQsetnonblocking</function> have a need for this.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
A typical application using these functions will have a main loop that uses
<function>select()</function> to wait for all the conditions that it must
respond to.  One of the conditions will be input available from the server,
which in terms of <function>select()</function> means readable data on the file
descriptor identified by <function>PQsocket</function>.
When the main loop detects input ready, it should call
<function>PQconsumeInput</function> to read the input.  It can then call
<function>PQisBusy</function>, followed by <function>PQgetResult</function>
if <function>PQisBusy</function> returns false (0).  It can also call
<function>PQnotifies</function> to detect <command>NOTIFY</> messages (see <xref linkend="libpq-notify">).
</para>

<para>
Nonblocking connections (that have used <function>PQsetnonblocking</function>)
should not use <function>select()</function> until <function>PQflush</function>
has returned 0 indicating that there is no buffered data waiting to be sent
to the server.
</para>

<para>
A client that uses <function>PQsendQuery</function>/<function>PQgetResult</function>
can also attempt to cancel a command that is still being processed by the server.

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><function>PQrequestCancel</function></term>
<listitem>
<para>
	  Requests that the server abandon
	  processing of the current command.
<synopsis>
int PQrequestCancel(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
The return value is 1 if the cancel request was successfully
dispatched and 0 if not.  (If not, <function>PQerrorMessage</function> tells why not.)
Successful dispatch is no guarantee that the request will have any
effect, however.  Regardless of the return value of <function>PQrequestCancel</function>,
the application must continue with the normal result-reading
sequence using <function>PQgetResult</function>.  If the cancellation
is effective, the current command will terminate early and return
an error result.  If the cancellation fails (say, because the
server was already done processing the command), then there will
be no visible result at all.
</para>

<para>
Note that if the current command is part of a transaction block, cancellation
will abort the whole transaction.
</para>

<para>
<function>PQrequestCancel</function> can safely be invoked from a signal handler.
So, it is also possible to use it in conjunction with plain
<function>PQexec</function>, if the decision to cancel can be made in a signal
handler.  For example, <application>psql</application> invokes
<function>PQrequestCancel</function> from a <symbol>SIGINT</> signal handler, thus allowing
interactive cancellation of commands that it issues through <function>PQexec</function>.

     to  by  <parameter>result_len</parameter>.   If a 4-byte integer result is expected, set
     <parameter>result_is_int</parameter> to 1, otherwise set it to 0.  (Setting <parameter>result_is_int</parameter> to 1
     tells <application>libpq</> to byte-swap the value if necessary, so that it is
     delivered as a proper <type>int</type> value for the client machine.  When
     <parameter>result_is_int</> is 0, the byte string sent by the server is returned
     unmodified.)
     <parameter>args</> and <parameter>nargs</> specify the arguments to be passed to the function.
</para>

<para>
     <function>PQfn</function> always returns a valid <structname>PGresult</structname> pointer. The result status

  <indexterm zone="libpq-notify"><primary>NOTIFY</primary></indexterm>

<para>
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> offers asynchronous notification via the
<command>LISTEN</command> and <command>NOTIFY</command> commands.  A server-side session registers its interest in a particular
notification condition with the <command>LISTEN</command> command (and can stop listening
with the <command>UNLISTEN</command> command).  All sessions listening on a
particular condition will be notified asynchronously when a <command>NOTIFY</command> command with that
condition name is executed by any session.  No additional information is
passed from the notifier to the listener.  Thus, typically, any actual data
that needs to be communicated is transferred through a database table.
Commonly, the condition name is the same as the associated table, but it is
not necessary for there to be any associated table.
</para>

<para>
<application>libpq</application> applications submit <command>LISTEN</command> and <command>UNLISTEN</command>

          notification messages received from the server.  It returns a null pointer if

even empty ones, and then check <function>PQnotifies()</function> after each
<function>PQexec()</function>.  While this still works, it is
deprecated as a waste of processing power.
</para>

<para>
A better way to check for <command>NOTIFY</>

<function>PQnotifies()</function>.
You can use <function>select()</function> to wait for data to
arrive from the server, thereby using no <acronym>CPU</acronym> power unless there is something
to do.  (See <function>PQsocket()</function> to obtain the file descriptor
number to use with <function>select()</function>.)
Note that this will work OK whether you submit commands with
<function>PQsendQuery</function>/<function>PQgetResult</function> or simply
use <function>PQexec</function>.  You should, however, remember to
check <function>PQnotifies()</function> after each
<function>PQgetResult</function> or <function>PQexec</function>, to see
if any notifications came in during the processing of the command.

the caller is too small to hold a row sent by the server, then a partial
data row will be returned.  With textual data this can be detected by testing
whether the last returned byte is <literal>\n</literal> or not.  (In a binary
COPY, actual parsing of the COPY data format will be needed to make the
equivalent determination.)
The returned string is not null-terminated.  (If you want to add a
terminating null, be sure to pass a <parameter>bufsize</parameter> one smaller
than the room actually available.)

Before <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 7.4, it was necessary for the

int PQendcopy(PGconn *conn);
</synopsis>
 This function waits until
 the  server  has  finished  the copying.  It should
 either be issued when the  last  string  has  been
 sent  to  the  server using <function>PQputline</function> or when the
 last string has been  received  from  the  server
 using <function>PGgetline</function>.  It must be issued or the server
 will get <quote>out of sync</quote> with  the client.   Upon
 return from this function, the server is ready to
 receive the next SQL command.
 The return value is 0  on  successful  completion,
 nonzero otherwise.  (Use <function>PQerrorMessage</function> to retrieve
 details if the return value is nonzero.)
</para>

<para>
When using <function>PQgetResult</function>, the application should respond to
a <literal>PGRES_COPY_OUT</literal> result by executing <function>PQgetline</function>
repeatedly, followed by <function>PQendcopy</function> after the terminator line is seen.
It should then return to the <function>PQgetResult</function> loop until
<function>PQgetResult</function> returns a null pointer. Similarly a <literal>PGRES_COPY_IN</literal>
result is processed by a series of <function>PQputline</function> calls followed by
<function>PQendcopy</function>, then return to the <function>PQgetResult</function> loop.
This arrangement will ensure that
a <command>COPY</command> command embedded in a series of <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands
will be executed correctly.
</para>

<para>
Older applications are likely to submit a <command>COPY</command>
via <function>PQexec</function> and assume that the transaction is done after
<function>PQendcopy</function>.
This will work correctly only if the <command>COPY</command> is the only

<title>Notice Processing</title>

<para>
The function <function>PQsetNoticeProcessor</function>

<synopsis>
typedef void (*PQnoticeProcessor) (void *arg, const char *message);

PQnoticeProcessor
PQsetNoticeProcessor(PGconn *conn,
                     PQnoticeProcessor proc,
                     void *arg);
</synopsis>
</para>

<para>
By default, <application>libpq</application> prints notice messages
from the server, as well as a few error messages that it generates by
itself, on <filename>stderr</filename>.
This behavior can be overridden by supplying a callback function that
does something else with the messages, a so-called notice processor.
The callback function is passed
the text of the message (which includes a trailing newline), plus
a void pointer that is the same one passed to
<function>PQsetNoticeProcessor</function>.
(This pointer can be used to access application-specific state if needed.)
The default notice processor is simply
<programlisting>
static void
defaultNoticeProcessor(void * arg, const char * message)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s", message);
}
</programlisting>
To use a special notice processor, call
<function>PQsetNoticeProcessor</function> just after
creation of a new <structname>PGconn</> object.
</para>

<para>
The return value is the pointer to the previous notice processor.
If you supply a null callback function pointer, no action is taken,
but the current pointer is returned.
</para>

<para>
Once you have set a notice processor, you should expect that that function
could be called as long as either the <structname>PGconn</> object or <structname>PGresult</> objects
made from it exist.  At creation of a <structname>PGresult</>, the <structname>PGconn</>'s current
notice processor pointer is copied into the <structname>PGresult</> for possible use by
functions like <function>PQgetvalue</function>.

Each of the first four fields may be a literal value, or <literal>*</literal>,

     <para>
      Include the <filename>libpq-fe.h</filename> header file:
<programlisting>
#include &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;

foo.c:35: `PGresult' undeclared (first use in this function)

      Point your compiler to the directory where the <productname>PostgreSQL</> header
      files were installed, by supplying the
      <literal>-I<replaceable>directory</replaceable></literal> option
      to your compiler.  (In some cases the compiler will look into
      the directory in question by default, so you can omit this
      option.)  For instance, your compile command line could look
      like:
<programlisting>
cc -c -I/usr/local/pgsql/include testprog.c
</programlisting>
      If you are using makefiles then add the option to the

     <para>

      If there is any chance that your program might be compiled by
      other users then you should not hardcode the directory location
      like that.  Instead, you can run the utility
      <command>pg_config</command> to find out where the header files
      are on the local system:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> pg_config --includedir
<computeroutput>/usr/local/include</computeroutput>

testlibpq.o(.text+0x71): undefined reference to `PQstatus'

</screen>
      This means you forgot <option>-lpq</option>.
