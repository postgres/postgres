    <listitem>
     <para>
      Guard against stack overflows in <type>json</> parsing
      (Oskari Saarenmaa)
     </para>

     <para>
      If an application constructs PostgreSQL <type>json</>
      or <type>jsonb</> values from arbitrary user input, the application's
      users can reliably crash the PostgreSQL server, causing momentary
      denial of service.  (CVE-2015-5289)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <filename>contrib/pgcrypto</> to detect and report
      too-short <function>crypt()</> salts (Josh Kupershmidt)
     </para>

     <para>
      Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few
      bytes of server memory.  We have not ruled out the viability of
      attacks that arrange for presence of confidential information in the
      disclosed bytes, but they seem unlikely.  (CVE-2015-5288)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix subtransaction cleanup after a portal (cursor) belonging to an
      outer subtransaction fails (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      A function executed in an outer-subtransaction cursor could cause an
      assertion failure or crash by referencing a relation created within an
      inner subtransaction.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Ensure all relations referred to by an updatable view are properly
      locked during an update statement (Dean Rasheed)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix insertion of relations into the relation cache <quote>init file</>
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases
      caused <structname>pg_trigger_tgrelid_tgname_index</> to be omitted
      from the init file.  Subsequent sessions detected this, then deemed the
      init file to be broken and silently ignored it, resulting in a
      significant degradation in session startup time.  In addition to fixing
      the bug, install some guards so that any similar future mistake will be
      more obvious.
     </para>

      Avoid O(N^2) behavior when inserting many tuples into a SPI query
      result (Neil Conway)
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix performance problem when a session alters large numbers of foreign
      key constraints (Jan Wieck, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This was seen primarily when restoring <application>pg_dump</> output
      for databases with many thousands of tables.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disable SSL renegotiation by default (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have seen
      too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL library and
      in our usage of it.  Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and
      later.  In the older branches, just change the default value
      of <varname>ssl_renegotiation_limit</> to zero (disabled).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Lower the minimum values of the <literal>*_freeze_max_age</> parameters
      (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      This is mainly to make tests of related behavior less time-consuming,
      but it may also be of value for installations with limited disk space.
     </para>

      Limit the maximum value of <varname>wal_buffers</> to 2GB to avoid

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix handling of <literal>DOW</> and <literal>DOY</> in datetime input
      (Greg Stark)
     </para>

     <para>
      These tokens aren't meant to be used in datetime values, but previously
      they resulted in opaque internal error messages rather
      than <quote>invalid input syntax</>.

     <para>
      Add recursion depth protections to regular expression, <literal>SIMILAR
      TO</>, and <literal>LIKE</> matching (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Suitable search patterns and a low stack depth limit could lead to
      stack-overrun crashes.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix potential infinite loop in regular expression execution (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A search pattern that can apparently match a zero-length string, but
      actually doesn't match because of a back reference, could lead to an
      infinite loop.

     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix assorted planner bugs (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These mistakes could lead to incorrect query plans that would give wrong
      answers, or to assertion failures in assert-enabled builds, or to odd
      planner errors such as <quote>could not devise a query plan for the
      given query</>, <quote>could not find pathkey item to
      sort</>, <quote>plan should not reference subplan's variable</>,
      or <quote>failed to assign all NestLoopParams to plan nodes</>.
      Thanks are due to Andreas Seltenreich and Piotr Stefaniak for fuzz
      testing that exposed these problems.

      Ensure standby promotion trigger files are removed at postmaster
      startup (Michael Paquier, Fujii Masao)
     </para>

     <para>
      This prevents unwanted promotion from occurring if these files appear
      in a database backup that is used to initialize a new standby server.

      During postmaster shutdown, ensure that per-socket lock files are
      removed and listen sockets are closed before we remove
      the <filename>postmaster.pid</> file (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This avoids race-condition failures if an external script attempts to
      start a new postmaster as soon as <literal>pg_ctl stop</> returns.

     <para>
      Fix postmaster's handling of a startup-process crash during crash
      recovery (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If, during a crash recovery cycle, the startup process crashes without
      having restored database consistency, we'd try to launch a new startup
      process, which typically would just crash again, leading to an infinite
      loop.

      Fix <application>pg_dump</> to handle object privileges sanely when

     <para>
      When dumping data types from pre-9.2 servers, and when dumping
      functions or procedural languages from pre-7.3
      servers, <application>pg_dump</> would
      produce <command>GRANT</>/<command>REVOKE</> commands that revoked the
      owner's grantable privileges and instead granted all privileges
      to <literal>PUBLIC</>.  Since the privileges involved are
      just <literal>USAGE</> and <literal>EXECUTE</>, this isn't a security
      problem, but it's certainly a surprising representation of the older

      Fix possible failure to recover from an inconsistent database state
      (Robert Haas)
     </para>

     <para>
      Recent <productname>PostgreSQL</> releases introduced mechanisms to
      protect against multixact wraparound, but some of that code did not
      account for the possibility that it would need to run during crash
      recovery, when the database may not be in a consistent state.  This
      could result in failure to restart after a crash, or failure to start
      up a secondary server.  The lingering effects of a previously-fixed
      bug in <application>pg_upgrade</> could also cause such a failure, in
      installations that had used <application>pg_upgrade</> versions
      between 9.3.0 and 9.3.4.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <application>pg_upgrade</> bug in question was that it would
      set <literal>oldestMultiXid</> to 1 in <filename>pg_control</> even
      if the true value should be higher.  With the fixes introduced in
      this release, such a situation will result in immediate emergency
      autovacuuming until a correct <literal>oldestMultiXid</> value can be
      determined.  If that would pose a hardship, users can avoid it by
      doing manual vacuuming <emphasis>before</> upgrading to this release.

      Improve planner's cost estimates for semi-joins and anti-joins with

     <para>
      This type of plan is quite cheap when all the join clauses are used
      as index scan conditions, even if the inner scan would nominally
      fetch many rows, because the executor will stop after obtaining one
      row.  The planner only partially accounted for that effect, and would
      therefore overestimate the cost, leading it to possibly choose some
      other much less efficient plan type.

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</>'ing data directory during

     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would
      prevent restart on some platforms; but it is common to make SSL
      certificate files unwritable by the server.  Revise this behavior so
      that permissions failures are ignored altogether, and other types of
      failures are logged but do not prevent continuing.

      Allow <application>libpq</> to use TLS protocol versions beyond v1

     <para>
      For a long time, <application>libpq</> was coded so that the only SSL
      protocol it would allow was TLS v1.  Now that newer TLS versions are
      becoming popular, allow it to negotiate the highest commonly-supported
      TLS version with the server.  (<productname>PostgreSQL</> servers were
      already capable of such negotiation, so no change is needed on the
      server side.)  This is a back-patch of a change already released in

      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the

     </para>

     <para>
      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </para>

     <para>
      It remains possible that some calls of the <function>*printf()</>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <filename>pgcrypto</>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.

      Protect against wraparound of multixact member IDs
      (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera, Robert Haas, Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      Under certain usage patterns, the existing defenses against this might
      be insufficient, allowing <filename>pg_multixact/members</> files to be
      removed too early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions
      that would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and
      improving autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent
      multixact member ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID
      wraparound.

      Fix incorrect declaration of <filename>contrib/citext</>'s
      <function>regexp_matches()</> functions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These functions should return <type>setof text[]</>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <type>text[]</>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <literal>g</> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </para>

     <para>
      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <literal>citext</> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <emphasis>not</> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <literal>ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</> in each database in
      which <literal>citext</> is installed.  (You can also <quote>update</>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <filename>citext</>'s <function>regexp_matches()</> functions.

      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux

      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not

      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</>'s

      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input

      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,

     <para>
      When <function>to_char()</> processes a numeric formatting template

      timestamp formatting template, <productname>PostgreSQL</> would write

      Fix buffer overrun in replacement <function>*printf()</> functions
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> includes a replacement implementation
      of <function>printf</> and related functions.  This code will overrun
      a stack buffer when formatting a floating point number (conversion
      specifiers <literal>e</>, <literal>E</>, <literal>f</>, <literal>F</>,
      <literal>g</> or <literal>G</>) with requested precision greater than
      about 500.  This will crash the server, and we have not ruled out the
      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
      the <function>to_char()</> SQL function.  While that is the only
      affected core <productname>PostgreSQL</> functionality, extension
      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.
     </para>

     <para>
      This issue primarily affects <productname>PostgreSQL</> on Windows.
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses the system implementation of these
      functions where adequate, which it is on other modern platforms.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

     <para>
      Some server error messages show the values of columns that violate
      a constraint, such as a unique constraint.  If the user does not have
      <literal>SELECT</> privilege on all columns of the table, this could
      mean exposing values that the user should not be able to see.  Adjust
      the code so that values are displayed only when they came from the SQL
      command or could be selected by the user.

     <para>
      A <type>numeric</> value's display scale (<literal>dscale</>) should

      apparently there's at least one broken client application that
      transmits binary <type>numeric</> values in which that's true.
      This leads to strange behavior since the extra digits are taken into
      account by arithmetic operations even though they aren't printed.
      The least risky fix seems to be to truncate away such <quote>hidden</>
      digits on receipt, so that the value is indeed what it prints as.

      Avoid wholesale autovacuuming when autovacuum is nominally off
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Even when autovacuum is nominally off, we will still launch autovacuum
      worker processes to vacuum tables that are at risk of XID wraparound.
      However, such a worker process then proceeded to vacuum all tables in
      the target database, if they met the usual thresholds for
      autovacuuming.  This is at best pretty unexpected; at worst it delays
      response to the wraparound threat.  Fix it so that if autovacuum is
      turned off, workers <emphasis>only</> do anti-wraparound vacuums and
      not any other work.

      Fix <application>psql</>'s <command>\s</> command to work nicely with

     </para>

     <para>
      When using libedit rather than readline, <command>\s</> printed the
      command history in a fairly unreadable encoded format, and on recent
      libedit versions might fail altogether.  Fix that by printing the
      history ourselves rather than having the library do it.  A pleasant
      side-effect is that the pager is used if appropriate.
     </para>

     <para>
      This patch also fixes a bug that caused newline encoding to be applied
      inconsistently when saving the command history with libedit.
      Multiline history entries written by older <application>psql</>
      versions will be read cleanly with this patch, but perhaps not
      vice versa, depending on the exact libedit versions involved.

      Support time zone abbreviations that change UTC offset from time to
      time (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, <productname>PostgreSQL</> assumed that the UTC offset
      associated with a time zone abbreviation (such as <literal>EST</>)
      never changes in the usage of any particular locale.  However this
      assumption fails in the real world, so introduce the ability for a
      zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
      Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
      feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
      abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
      In such timezones, <productname>PostgreSQL</> will now associate the
      correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.

     <para>
      The IANA timezone database has adopted abbreviations of the form
      <literal>A<replaceable>x</>ST</literal>/<literal>A<replaceable>x</>DT</literal>
      for all Australian time zones, reflecting what they believe to be
      current majority practice Down Under.  These names do not conflict
      with usage elsewhere (other than ACST for Acre Summer Time, which has
      been in disuse since 1994).  Accordingly, adopt these names into
      our <quote>Default</> timezone abbreviation set.
      The <quote>Australia</> abbreviation set now contains only CST, EAST,
      EST, SAST, SAT, and WST, all of which are thought to be mostly
      historical usage.  Note that SAST has also been changed to be South
      Africa Standard Time in the <quote>Default</> abbreviation set.

     <para>
      Also, add zone abbreviations SRET (Asia/Srednekolymsk) and XJT

      DST law changes in Chile, Mexico, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands
      (America/Grand_Turk), and Fiji.  There is a new zone
      Pacific/Bougainville for portions of Papua New Guinea.  Also, numerous
      corrections for historical (pre-1970) time zone data.

     </para>

     <para>
      If you used a pre-9.3.5 version of <application>pg_upgrade</> to
      upgrade a database cluster to 9.3, it might have left behind a file
      <filename>$PGDATA/pg_multixact/offsets/0000</> that should not be
      there and will eventually cause problems in <command>VACUUM</>.
      <emphasis>However, in common cases this file is actually valid and
      must not be removed.</emphasis>
      To determine whether your installation has this problem, run this
      query as superuser, in any database of the cluster:
<programlisting>
WITH list(file) AS (SELECT * FROM pg_ls_dir('pg_multixact/offsets'))
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = '0000') AND
       NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = '0001') AND
       NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = 'FFFF') AND
       EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file != '0000')
       AS file_0000_removal_required;
</programlisting>
      If this query returns <literal>t</>, manually remove the file
      <filename>$PGDATA/pg_multixact/offsets/0000</>.
      Do nothing if the query returns <literal>f</>.

      Ensure that the planner sees equivalent <literal>VARIADIC</> and

     </para>

     <para>
      This bug could for example result in failure to use expression indexes
      involving variadic functions.  It might be necessary to re-create such
      indexes, and/or re-create views including variadic function calls that
      should match the indexes, for the fix to be effective for existing 9.3
      installations.

      Reduce indentation in rule/view dumps to improve readability and avoid
      excessive whitespace (Greg Stark, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change reduces the amount of indentation applied to nested
      constructs, including some cases that the user probably doesn't think
      of as nested, such as UNION lists.  Previously, deeply nested
      constructs were printed with an amount of whitespace growing as
      O(N^2), which created a performance problem and even risk of
      out-of-memory failures.  Now the indentation is reduced modulo 40,
      which is initially odd to look at but seems to preserve readability
      better than simply limiting the indentation would do.
      Redundant parenthesization of UNION lists has been reduced as well.

      Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during
      <literal>make check</> (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <filename>/tmp</>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.
     </para>

     <para>
      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <literal>make check</> testing in builds that
      override <literal>DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR</>.  Popular non-default values
      like <filename>/var/run/postgresql</> are often not writable by the
      build user, requiring workarounds that will no longer be necessary.

      Avoid buffer bloat in <application>libpq</> when the server

      <application>libpq</> could be coerced into enlarging its input buffer

      Fix WAL replay of locking an already-updated tuple (Andres Freund,
      &Aacute;lvaro Herrera)
     </para>

     <para>
      This error caused updated rows to not be found by index scans, resulting
      in inconsistent query results depending on whether an index scan was
      used.  Subsequent processing could result in constraint violations,
      since the previously updated row would not be found by later index
      searches, thus possibly allowing conflicting rows to be inserted.
      Since this error is in WAL replay, it would only manifest during crash
      recovery or on standby servers.  The improperly-replayed case most
      commonly arises when a table row that is referenced by a foreign-key
      constraint is updated concurrently with creation of a referencing row.

      Restore GIN metapages unconditionally to avoid torn-page risk
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      Although this oversight could theoretically result in a corrupted
      index, it is unlikely to have caused any problems in practice, since
      the active part of a GIN metapage is smaller than a standard 512-byte
      disk sector.

   <para>
    However, several of the issues corrected in this release could have
    resulted in corruption of foreign-key constraints; that is, there
    might now be referencing rows for which there is no matching row in
    the referenced table.  It may be worthwhile to recheck such
    constraints after installing this update.  The simplest way to do that
    is to drop and recreate each suspect constraint; however, that will
    require taking an exclusive lock on both tables, so it is unlikely to
    be acceptable in production databases.  Alternatively, you can do a
    manual join query between the two tables to look for unmatched rows.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note also the requirement for replication standby servers to be
    upgraded before their master server is upgraded.

      Shore up <literal>GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION</> restrictions
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET
      ROLE</> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can
      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</> functions.

      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

     <para>
      These text files duplicated the main HTML and PDF documentation
      formats.  The trouble involved in maintaining them greatly outweighs
      the likely audience for plain-text format.  Distribution tarballs
      will still contain files by these names, but they'll just be stubs
      directing the reader to consult the main documentation.
      The plain-text <filename>INSTALL</> file will still be maintained, as
      there is arguably a use-case for that.

      Fix <command>VACUUM</>'s tests to see whether it can
      update <structfield>relfrozenxid</> (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In some cases <command>VACUUM</> (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's <structfield>relfrozenxid</> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  In 9.2.0
      and later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible
      to get <quote>could not access status of transaction</> errors as a
      consequence of this bug.  Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8
      or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain the bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <literal>SELECT txid_current() < 2^31</>).

      Fix multiple bugs in MultiXactId freezing (Andres Freund,

     <para>
      These bugs could lead to <quote>could not access status of
      transaction</> errors, or to duplicate or vanishing rows.
      Users upgrading from releases prior to 9.3.0 are not affected.

      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link

     </para>

     <para>
      As a separate issue, these bugs can also cause standby servers to get
      out of sync with the primary, thus exhibiting data errors that are not
      in the primary.  Therefore, it's recommended that 9.3.0 and 9.3.1
      standby servers be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new base
      backup) after upgrading.

      Fix initialization of <filename>pg_clog</> and <filename>pg_subtrans</>
      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.

        Throw an error if a tuple to be updated or deleted has already been

       </para>

       <para>
        Formerly, the originally-intended update was silently skipped,
        resulting in logical inconsistency since the trigger might have
        propagated data to other places based on the intended update.
        Now an error is thrown to prevent the inconsistent results from being
        committed.  If this change affects your application, the best solution
        is usually to move the data-propagation actions to
        an <literal>AFTER</> trigger.

       <para>
        This change improves concurrency and reduces the probability of
        deadlocks when updating tables involved in a foreign-key constraint.
        <command>UPDATE</>s that do not change any columns referenced in a
        foreign key now take the new <literal>NO KEY UPDATE</> lock mode on
        the row, while foreign key checks use the new <literal>KEY SHARE</>
        lock mode, which does not conflict with <literal>NO KEY UPDATE</>.
        So there is no blocking unless a foreign-key column is changed.

        Unlike ordinary views, where the base tables are read on every access,

        Table and column renamings can produce cases where, if we merely

        Prevent leakage of <acronym>SPI</> tuple tables during subtransaction

       <para>
        At the end of any failed subtransaction, the core SPI code now
        releases any SPI tuple tables that were created during that
        subtransaction.  This avoids the need for SPI-using code to keep track
        of such tuple tables and release them manually in error-recovery code.
        Failure to do so caused a number of transaction-lifespan memory leakage
        issues in PL/pgSQL and perhaps other SPI clients.  <link
        linkend="spi-spi-freetupletable"><function>SPI_freetuptable()</></link>
        now protects itself against multiple freeing requests, so any existing
