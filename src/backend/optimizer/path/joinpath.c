 * add_paths_to_joinrel
 *	  Given a join relation and two component rels from which it can be made,
 *	  consider all possible paths that use the two component rels as outer
 *	  and inner rel respectively.  Add these paths to the join rel's pathlist
 *	  if they survive comparison with other paths (and remove any existing
 *	  paths that are dominated by these paths).
 *
 * Modifies the pathlist field of the joinrel node to contain the best
 * paths found so far.
 *
 * jointype is not necessarily the same as sjinfo->jointype; it might be
 * "flipped around" if we are considering joining the rels in the opposite
 * direction from what's indicated in sjinfo.
 *
 * Also, this routine and others in this module accept the special JoinTypes
 * JOIN_UNIQUE_OUTER and JOIN_UNIQUE_INNER to indicate that we should
 * unique-ify the outer or inner relation and then apply a regular inner
 * join.  These values are not allowed to propagate outside this module,
 * however.  Path cost estimation code may need to recognize that it's
 * dealing with such a case --- the combination of nominal jointype INNER
 * with sjinfo->jointype == JOIN_SEMI indicates that.
