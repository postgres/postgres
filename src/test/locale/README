$Header: /cvsroot/pgsql/src/test/locale/README,v 1.4 2002/09/03 21:45:44 petere Exp $

This directory contains a set of tests for locales.  I provided one C
program test-ctype.c to test CTYPE support in libc and the installed
locale data.  Then there are test-sort.pl and test-sort.py that test
collating.

To run a test for some locale run
    gmake check-$locale
for example
    gmake check-koi8-r

Currently, there are only tests for a few locales available.  The script
'runall' calls test-ctype to test libc and locale data, test-sort.pl
(uncomment test-sort.py, if you have a Python interpreter installed), and
does tests on PostgreSQL with the provided SQL script files.

To add locale tests one needs to create a directory $locale and create
a Makefile (and other files) similar to koi8-r/*.  Actually, the simplest
(I think) method is just to copy the koi8-r directory and edit/replace
the files.
