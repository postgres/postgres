  <para>
   PostgreSQL provides infrastructure to stream the modifications performed
   via SQL to external consumers.  This functionality can be used for a
   variety of purposes, including replication solutions and auditing.
  </para>

  <para>
   Changes are sent out in streams identified by logical replication slots.
   Each stream outputs each change exactly once.
  </para>

  <para>
   The format in which those changes are streamed is determined by the output
   plugin used.  An example plugin is provided in the PostgreSQL distribution.
   Additional plugins can be
   written to extend the choice of available formats without modifying any
   core code.
   Every output plugin has access to each individual new row produced
   by <command>INSERT</command> and the new row version created
   by <command>UPDATE</command>.  Availability of old row versions for
   <command>UPDATE</command> and <command>DELETE</command> depends on
   the configured replica identity (see <xref linkend="SQL-CREATETABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY">).
  </para>

  <para>
   Changes can be consumed either using the streaming replication protocol
   (see <xref linkend="protocol-replication"> and
   <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-walsender">), or by calling functions
   via SQL (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-sql">). It is also possible
   to write additional methods of consuming the output of a replication slot
   without modifying core code
   (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-writer">).

   <para>
    The following example demonstrates controlling logical decoding using the
    SQL interface.
   </para>

   <para>
    Before you can use logical decoding, you must set
    <xref linkend="guc-wal-level"> to <literal>logical</literal> and
    <xref linkend="guc-max-replication-slots"> to at least 1.  Then, you
    should connect to the target database (in the example
    below, <literal>postgres</literal>) as a superuser.

    The following example shows how logical decoding is controlled over the
    streaming replication protocol, using the
    program <xref linkend="app-pgrecvlogical"> included in the PostgreSQL
    distribution.  This requires that client authentication is set up to allow

    <para>
     Logical decoding is the process of extracting all persistent changes
     to a database's tables into a coherent, easy to understand format which
     can be interpreted without detailed knowledge of the database's internal
     state.
    </para>

    <para>
     In <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, logical decoding is implemented
     by decoding the contents of the <link linkend="wal">write-ahead
     log</link>, which describe changes on a storage level, into an
     application-specific form such as a stream of tuples or SQL statements.

    <title>Replication Slots</title>

    <indexterm>
     <primary>replication slot</primary>
     <secondary>logical replication</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>
     In the context of logical replication, a slot represents a stream of
     changes that can be replayed to a client in the order they were made on
     the origin server. Each slot streams a sequence of changes from a single
     database, sending each change exactly once (except when peeking forward
     in the stream).
    </para>

    <note>
     <para><productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also has streaming replication slots
     (see <xref linkend="streaming-replication">), but they are used somewhat
     differently there.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     A replication slot has an identifier that is unique across all databases
     in a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> cluster. Slots persist
     independently of the connection using them and are crash-safe.
    </para>

    <para>
     Multiple independent slots may exist for a single database. Each slot has
     its own state, allowing different consumers to receive changes from
     different points in the database change stream. For most applications, a
     separate slot will be required for each consumer.
    </para>

    <para>
     A logical replication slot knows nothing about the state of the
     receiver(s).  It's even possible to have multiple different receivers using
     the same slot at different times; they'll just get the changes following
     on from when the last receiver stopped consuming them. Only one receiver
     may consume changes from a slot at any given time.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      Replication slots persist across crashes and know nothing about the state
      of their consumer(s). They will prevent removal of required resources
      even when there is no connection using them. This consumes storage
      because neither required WAL nor required rows from the system catalogs
      can be removed by <command>VACUUM</command> as long as they are required by a replication
      slot.  So if a slot is no longer required it should be dropped.

    <title>Output Plugins</title>
    <para>
     Output plugins transform the data from the write-ahead log's internal
     representation into the format the consumer of a replication slot desires.

   <sect2>
    <title>Exported Snapshots</title>
    <para>
     When a new replication slot is created using the streaming replication interface,
     a snapshot is exported
     (see <xref linkend="functions-snapshot-synchronization">), which will show
     exactly the state of the database after which all changes will be
     included in the change stream. This can be used to create a new replica by
     using <link linkend="sql-set-transaction"><literal>SET TRANSACTION
     SNAPSHOT</literal></link> to read the state of the database at the moment
     the slot was created. This transaction can then be used to dump the
     database's state at that point in time, which afterwards can be updated
     using the slot's contents without losing any changes.

    <para>
     An output plugin is loaded by dynamically loading a shared library with
     the output plugin's name as the library base name. The normal library
     search path is used to locate the library. To provide the required output
     plugin callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually an output
     plugin it needs to provide a function named
     <function>_PG_output_plugin_init</function>. This function is passed a
     struct that needs to be filled with the callback function pointers for
     individual actions.

   <sect2 id="logicaldecoding-capabilities">
    <title>Capabilities</title>

    <para>
     To decode, format and output changes, output plugins can use most of the
     backend's normal infrastructure, including calling output functions. Read
     only access to relations is permitted as long as only relations are
     accessed that either have been created by <command>initdb</command> in
     the <literal>pg_catalog</literal> schema, or have been marked as user
     provided catalog tables using
<programlisting>
ALTER TABLE user_catalog_table SET (user_catalog_table = true);
CREATE TABLE another_catalog_table(data text) WITH (user_catalog_table = true);
</programlisting>
     Any actions leading to transaction ID assignment are prohibited. That, among others,
     includes writing to tables, performing DDL changes, and
     calling <literal>txid_current()</literal>.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="logicaldecoding-output-mode">
    <title>Output Modes</title>

    <para>
     Output plugin callbacks can pass data to the consumer in nearly arbitrary
     formats. For some use cases, like viewing the changes via SQL, returning
     data in a data type that can contain arbitrary data (e.g., <type>bytea</type>) is
     cumbersome. If the output plugin only outputs textual data in the
     server's encoding, it can declare that by
     setting <literal>OutputPluginOptions.output_mode</>
     to <literal>OUTPUT_PLUGIN_TEXTUAL_OUTPUT</> instead
     of <literal>OUTPUT_PLUGIN_BINARY_OUTPUT</> in
     the <link linkend="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-startup">startup
     callback</>. In that case, all the data has to be in the server's encoding
     so that a <type>text</> datum can contain it. This is checked in assertion-enabled
     builds.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-callbacks">
    <title>Output Plugin Callbacks</title>

    <para>
     An output plugin gets notified about changes that are happening via
     various callbacks it needs to provide.
    </para>

    <para>
     Concurrent transactions are decoded in commit order, and only changes
     belonging to a specific transaction are decoded between
     the <literal>begin</literal> and <literal>commit</literal>
     callbacks. Transactions that were rolled back explicitly or implicitly
     never get
     decoded. Successful savepoints are
     folded into the transaction containing them in the order they were
     executed within that transaction.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      Only transactions that have already safely been flushed to disk will be
      decoded. That can lead to a <command>COMMIT</command> not immediately being decoded in a
      directly following <literal>pg_logical_slot_get_changes()</literal>

       This is useful when implementing cascading or multidirectional

   <title>Logical Decoding Output Writers</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to add more output methods for logical decoding.
    For details, see
    <filename>src/backend/replication/logical/logicalfuncs.c</filename>.
    Essentially, three functions need to be provided: one to read WAL, one to
    prepare writing output, and one to write the output
    (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-output">).

  <sect1 id="logicaldecoding-synchronous">
   <title>Synchronous Replication Support for Logical Decoding</title>

   <para>
    Logical decoding can be used to build
    <link linkend="synchronous-replication">synchronous
    replication</link> solutions with the same user interface as synchronous
    replication for <link linkend="streaming-replication">streaming
    replication</link>.  To do this, the streaming replication interface
    (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-walsender">) must be used to stream out
    data. Clients have to send <literal>Standby status update (F)</literal>
    (see <xref linkend="protocol-replication">) messages, just like streaming
    replication clients do.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     A synchronous replica receiving changes via logical decoding will work in
     the scope of a single database. Since, in contrast to
     that, <parameter>synchronous_standby_names</parameter> currently is
     server wide, this means this technique will not work properly if more
     than one database is actively used.
