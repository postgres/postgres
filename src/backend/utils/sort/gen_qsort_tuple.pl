# gen_qsort_tuple.pl
#
# This script generates specialized versions of the quicksort algorithm for
# tuple sorting.  The quicksort code is derived from the NetBSD code.  The
# code generated by this script runs significantly faster than vanilla qsort
# when used to sort tuples.  This speedup comes from a number of places.
# The major effects are (1) inlining simple tuple comparators is much faster
# than jumping through a function pointer and (2) swap and vecswap operations
# specialized to the particular data type of interest (in this case, SortTuple)
# are faster than the generic routines.
#
#	Modifications from vanilla NetBSD source:
#	  Add do ... while() macro fix
#	  Remove __inline, _DIAGASSERTs, __P
#	  Remove ill-considered "swap_cnt" switch to insertion sort,
#	  in favor of a simple check for presorted input.
#	  Take care to recurse on the smaller partition, to bound stack usage.
#
#     Instead of sorting arbitrary objects, we're always sorting SortTuples.
#     Add CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS().
#
# CAUTION: if you change this file, see also qsort.c and qsort_arg.c

 * Qsort routine based on J. L. Bentley and M. D. McIlroy,
 * "Engineering a sort function",
 * Software--Practice and Experience 23 (1993) 1249-1265.
 *
 * We have modified their original by adding a check for already-sorted input,
 * which seems to be a win per discussions on pgsql-hackers around 2006-03-21.
 *
 * Also, we recurse on the smaller partition and iterate on the larger one,
 * which ensures we cannot recurse more than log(N) levels (since the
 * partition recursed to is surely no more than half of the input).  Bentley
 * and McIlroy explicitly rejected doing this on the grounds that it's "not
 * worth the effort", but we have seen crashes in the field due to stack
 * overrun, so that judgment seems wrong.
