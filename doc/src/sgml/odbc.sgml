  <para>
   <acronym>ODBC</acronym> (Open Database Connectivity) is an abstract 
   <acronym>API</acronym> 
   which allows you to write applications which can interoperate
   with various <acronym>RDBMS</acronym> servers.
   <acronym>ODBC</acronym> provides a product-neutral interface 
   between frontend applications and database servers,
   allowing a user or developer to write applications which are 
   transportable between servers from different manufacturers..
  </para>

  <sect1>
   <title>Background</title>

   <para>
    The <acronym>ODBC</acronym> <acronym>API</acronym> matches up 
    on the backend to an <acronym>ODBC</acronym>-compatible data source.
    This could be anything from a text file to an Oracle or 
    <productname>Postgres</productname> <acronym>RDBMS</acronym>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The backend access come from <acronym>ODBC</acronym> drivers, 
    or vendor specifc drivers that
    allow data access.   <productname>psqlODBC</productname> is such a driver,
    along with others that are
    available, such as the OpenLink <acronym>ODBC</acronym> drivers.
   </para>

   <para>
    Once you write an <acronym>ODBC</acronym> application, 
    you <emphasis>should</emphasis> be able to connect to <emphasis>any</emphasis>
    back end database, regardless of the vendor, as long as the database schema
    is the same.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example. you could have <productname>MS SQL Server</productname>
    and <productname>Postgres</productname> servers which have
    exactly the same data.  Using <acronym>ODBC</acronym>, 
    your Windows application would make exactly the
    same calls and the back end data source would look the same (to the Windows
    app).

   <title>Unix Installation</title>

   <para>
    <productname>ApplixWare</productname> has an 
    <acronym>ODBC</acronym> database interface
    supported on at least some platforms. 
    <productname>ApplixWare</productname> v4.4.1 has been
    demonstrated under Linux with <productname>Postgres</productname> v6.4 
    using the <productname>psqlODBC</productname>
    driver contained in the <productname>Postgres</productname> distribution.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Building the Driver</title>

    <para>
     The first thing
     to note about the <productname>psqlODBC</productname> driver
     (or any <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver) is that there must
     exist a driver manager on the system where
     the <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver is to be
     used. There exists a freeware <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver for Unix
     called <productname>iodbc</productname> which
     can be obtained from various locations on the Net, including at
     <ulink url="http://www.as220.org/FreeODBC/iodbc-2.12.shar.Z">AS200</ulink>. 
     Instructions for installing <productname>iodbc</productname>
     are beyond the scope of this
     document, but there is a <filename>README</filename>
     that can be found inside the <productname>iodbc</productname> compressed
     .shar file that should explain how to get it up and running.
    </para>

    <para>
     Having said that, any driver manager that you can find for your platform
     should support the <productname>psqlODBC</productname> driver
     or any <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver.
    </para>

    <para>
     The Unix configuration files for <productname>psqlODBC</productname>
     have recently been extensively
     reworked to allow for easy building on supported platforms as
     well as to allow for support of other Unix platforms in the future.
     The new configuration and build files for the driver should make it
     a simple process to build the driver on the supported platforms. Currently
     these include Linux and FreeBSD but we are hoping other users will
     contribute the necessary information to quickly expand the number of
     platforms for which the driver can be built.
    </para>

    <para>
     There are actually two separate methods to build the driver depending on
     how you received it and these differences come down to only where and how to
     run <application>configure</application> and <application>make</application>. 
     The driver can be built in a standalone, client-only installation, or can be 
     built as a part of the main <productname>Postgres</productname> distribution.
     The standalone installation is convenient if you have <acronym>ODBC</acronym>
     client applications on multiple, heterogeneous platforms. The integrated
     installation is convenient when the target client is the same as the
     server, or when the client and server have similar runtime configurations.
    </para>

    <para>
     Specifically if you have received the <productname>psqlODBC</productname>
     driver as part of the <productname>Postgres</productname> distribution
     (from now on referred to as an "integrated" build) then you will
     configure and make the <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver
     from the top level source directory
     of the <productname>Postgres</productname> distribution
     along with the rest of its libraries.
     If you received the driver as a standalone package than you will run
     configure and make from the directory in which you unpacked the
     driver source.
    </para>

     Once configured, the <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver will be built and installed

     <para>
      A standalone installation is not integrated with or built on the normal

      source tree.
     </para>

     <para>
      The default location for libraries and headers 
      for the standalone installation is <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>
      and <filename>/usr/local/include/iodbc</filename>, respectively.
      There is another system wide configuration file that gets installed
      as <filename>/share/odbcinst.ini</filename> (if <filename>/share</filename>

      <para>
       Installation of files into <filename>/share</filename>

       You can also override the default location for installation on the

       of the odbcinst.ini file attempting to override the enviroment variable
       that specifies its installation directory will probably cause you
       headaches. It is safest simply to allow the driver to install the
       odbcinst.ini file in the default directory or the directory you specified
       on the './configure' command line with --with-odbc.

     The <application>axnet</application> program's security system
     seems a little suspect. <application>axnet</application> does things
     on behalf of the user and on a true
     multiple user system it really should be run with root security 
     (so it can read/write in each user's directory).  
     I would hesitate to recommend this, however, since we have no idea what 
     security holes this creates.

      </note>
     </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>
     For example, after getting
     a <quote>Cannot launch gateway on server</quote>, 
     I ran strace on axnet and got

     <programlisting>
      [pid 27947] open("/usr/lib/libodbc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT
      (No such file or directory)
      [pid 27947] open("/lib/libodbc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT
      (No such file or directory)
      [pid 27947] write(2, "/usr2/applix/axdata/elfodbc:
      can't load library 'libodbc.so'\n", 61) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
     </programlisting>  
     So what is happening is that applix elfodbc is searching for libodbc.so, but it
     can't find it.  That is why axnet.cnf needed to be changed.

     In order to go through the

     the sample tables that the Tutorial refers to.  The ELF Macro used to

     on many of the database columns,
     and <productname>Postgres</productname> does not currently allow this option.
