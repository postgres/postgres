  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows user-defined functions
   to be written in other languages besides SQL and C.  These other
   languages are generically called <firstterm>procedural
   languages</firstterm> (<acronym>PL</>s).  For a function
   written in a procedural language, the database server has
   no built-in knowledge about how to interpret the function's source
   text. Instead, the task is passed to a special handler that knows
   the details of the language.  The handler could either do all the
   work of parsing, syntax analysis, execution, etc. itself, or it
   could serve as <quote>glue</quote> between
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and an existing implementation
   of a programming language.  The handler itself is a
   C language function compiled into a shared object and
   loaded on demand, just like any other C function.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are currently four procedural languages available in the
   standard <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution:
   <application>PL/pgSQL</application> (<xref linkend="plpgsql">),
   <application>PL/Tcl</application> (<xref linkend="pltcl">),
   <application>PL/Perl</application> (<xref linkend="plperl">), and
   <application>PL/Python</application> (<xref linkend="plpython">).
   There are additional procedural languages available that are not
   included in the core distribution. <xref linkend="external-projects">
   has information about finding them. In addition other languages can
   be defined by users; the basics of developing a new procedural
   language are covered in <xref linkend="plhandler">.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="xplang-install">
   <title>Installing Procedural Languages</title>

   <para>
    A procedural language must be <quote>installed</quote> into each
    database where it is to be used.  But procedural languages installed in
    the database <literal>template1</> are automatically available in all
    subsequently created databases, since their entries in
    <literal>template1</> will be copied by <command>CREATE DATABASE</>.
    So the database administrator can
    decide which languages are available in which databases and can make
    some languages available by default if he chooses.
   </para>

   <para>
    For the languages supplied with the standard distribution, it is
    only necessary to execute <command>CREATE EXTENSION</>
    <replaceable>language_name</> to install the language into the
    current database.  Alternatively, the program <xref
    linkend="app-createlang"> can be used to do this from the shell
    command line.  For example, to install the language
    <application>PL/Perl</application> into the database
    <literal>template1</>, use:
<programlisting>
createlang plperl template1
</programlisting>
    The manual procedure described below is only recommended for
    installing languages that have not been packaged as extensions.
   </para>

   <procedure>
    <title>
     Manual Procedural Language Installation
    </title>

    <para>
     A procedural language is installed in a database in five steps,
     which must be carried out by a database superuser.  In most cases
     the required SQL commands should be packaged as the installation script
     of an <quote>extension</>, so that <command>CREATE EXTENSION</> can be
     used to execute them.
    </para>

    <step performance="required" id="xplang-install-cr1">
     <para>
      The shared object for the language handler must be compiled and
      installed into an appropriate library directory.  This works in the same
      way as building and installing modules with regular user-defined C
      functions does; see <xref linkend="dfunc">.  Often, the language
      handler will depend on an external library that provides the actual
      programming language engine; if so, that must be installed as well.
     </para>
    </step>

    <step performance="required" id="xplang-install-cr2">
     <para>
      The handler must be declared with the command
<synopsis>
CREATE FUNCTION <replaceable>handler_function_name</replaceable>()
    RETURNS language_handler
    AS '<replaceable>path-to-shared-object</replaceable>'
    LANGUAGE C;
</synopsis>
      The special return type of <type>language_handler</type> tells
      the database system that this function does not return one of
      the defined <acronym>SQL</acronym> data types and is not directly usable
      in <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements.
     </para>
    </step>

    <step performance="optional" id="xplang-install-cr3">
     <para>
      Optionally, the language handler can provide an <quote>inline</>
      handler function that executes anonymous code blocks
      (<xref linkend="sql-do"> commands)
      written in this language.  If an inline handler function
      is provided by the language, declare it with a command like
<synopsis>
CREATE FUNCTION <replaceable>inline_function_name</replaceable>(internal)
    RETURNS void
    AS '<replaceable>path-to-shared-object</replaceable>'
    LANGUAGE C;
</synopsis>
     </para>
    </step>

    <step performance="optional" id="xplang-install-cr4">
     <para>
      Optionally, the language handler can provide a <quote>validator</>
      function that checks a function definition for correctness without
      actually executing it.  The validator function is called by
      <command>CREATE FUNCTION</> if it exists.  If a validator function
      is provided by the language, declare it with a command like
<synopsis>
CREATE FUNCTION <replaceable>validator_function_name</replaceable>(oid)
    RETURNS void
    AS '<replaceable>path-to-shared-object</replaceable>'
    LANGUAGE C STRICT;
</synopsis>
     </para>
    </step>

    <step performance="required" id="xplang-install-cr5">
     <para>
      Finally, the PL must be declared with the command
<synopsis>
CREATE <optional>TRUSTED</optional> <optional>PROCEDURAL</optional> LANGUAGE <replaceable>language-name</replaceable>
    HANDLER <replaceable>handler_function_name</replaceable>
    <optional>INLINE <replaceable>inline_function_name</replaceable></optional>
    <optional>VALIDATOR <replaceable>validator_function_name</replaceable></optional> ;
</synopsis>
      The optional key word <literal>TRUSTED</literal> specifies that
      the language does not grant access to data that the user would
      not otherwise have.  Trusted languages are designed for ordinary
      database users (those without superuser privilege) and allows them
      to safely create functions and trigger
      procedures. Since PL functions are executed inside the database
      server, the <literal>TRUSTED</literal> flag should only be given
      for languages that do not allow access to database server
      internals or the file system. The languages
      <application>PL/pgSQL</application>,
      <application>PL/Tcl</application>, and
      <application>PL/Perl</application>
      are considered trusted; the languages
      <application>PL/TclU</application>,
      <application>PL/PerlU</application>, and
      <application>PL/PythonU</application>
      are designed to provide unlimited functionality and should
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> be marked trusted.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>

   <para>
    <xref linkend="xplang-install-example"> shows how the manual
    installation procedure would work with the language
    <application>PL/Perl</application>.
   </para>

   <example id="xplang-install-example">
    <title>Manual Installation of <application>PL/Perl</application></title>

     <para>
      The following command tells the database server where to find the
      shared object for the <application>PL/Perl</application> language's call
      handler function:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION plperl_call_handler() RETURNS language_handler AS
    '$libdir/plperl' LANGUAGE C;
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>PL/Perl</application> has an inline handler function
      and a validator function, so we declare those too:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION plperl_inline_handler(internal) RETURNS void AS
    '$libdir/plperl' LANGUAGE C;

CREATE FUNCTION plperl_validator(oid) RETURNS void AS
    '$libdir/plperl' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      The command:
<programlisting>
CREATE TRUSTED PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plperl
    HANDLER plperl_call_handler
    INLINE plperl_inline_handler
    VALIDATOR plperl_validator;
</programlisting>
      then defines that the previously declared functions
      should be invoked for functions and trigger procedures where the
      language attribute is <literal>plperl</literal>.
     </para>
  </example>

   <para>
    In a default <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation,
    the handler for the <application>PL/pgSQL</application> language
    is built and installed into the <quote>library</quote>
    directory; furthermore, the <application>PL/pgSQL</application> language
    itself is installed in all databases.
    If <application>Tcl</> support is configured in, the handlers for
    <application>PL/Tcl</> and <application>PL/TclU</> are built and installed
    in the library directory, but the language itself is not installed in any
    database by default.
    Likewise, the <application>PL/Perl</> and <application>PL/PerlU</>
    handlers are built and installed if Perl support is configured, and the
    <application>PL/PythonU</> handler is installed if Python support is
    configured, but these languages are not installed by default.
   </para>
