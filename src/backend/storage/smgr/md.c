/*
 * The magnetic disk storage manager keeps track of open file
 * descriptors in its own descriptor pool.  This is done to make it
 * easier to support relations that are larger than the operating
 * system's file size limit (often 2GBytes).  In order to do that,
 * we break relations up into "segment" files that are each shorter than
 * the OS file size limit.  The segment size is set by the RELSEG_SIZE
 * configuration constant in pg_config.h.
 *
 * On disk, a relation must consist of consecutively numbered segment
 * files in the pattern
 *	-- Zero or more full segments of exactly RELSEG_SIZE blocks each
 *	-- Exactly one partial segment of size 0 <= size < RELSEG_SIZE blocks
 *	-- Optionally, any number of inactive segments of size 0 blocks.
 * The full and partial segments are collectively the "active" segments.
 * Inactive segments are those that once contained data but are currently
 * not needed because of an mdtruncate() operation.  The reason for leaving
 * them present at size zero, rather than unlinking them, is that other
 * backends and/or the checkpointer might be holding open file references to
 * such segments.  If the relation expands again after mdtruncate(), such
 * that a deactivated segment becomes active again, it is important that
 * such file references still be valid --- else data might get written
 * out to an unlinked old copy of a segment file that will eventually
 * disappear.
 *
 * File descriptors are stored in the per-fork md_seg_fds arrays inside
 * SMgrRelation. The length of these arrays is stored in md_num_open_segs.
 * Note that a fork's md_num_open_segs having a specific value does not
 * necessarily mean the relation doesn't have additional segments; we may
 * just not have opened the next segment yet.  (We could not have "all
 * segments are in the array" as an invariant anyway, since another backend
 * could extend the relation while we aren't looking.)  We do not have
 * entries for inactive segments, however; as soon as we find a partial
 * segment, we assume that any subsequent segments are inactive.
 *
 * The entire MdfdVec array is palloc'd in the MdCxt memory context.

/*
 * mdunlink() -- Unlink a relation.
 *
 * Note that we're passed a RelFileLocatorBackend --- by the time this is called,
 * there won't be an SMgrRelation hashtable entry anymore.
 *
 * forknum can be a fork number to delete a specific fork, or InvalidForkNumber
 * to delete all forks.
 *
 * For regular relations, we don't unlink the first segment file of the rel,
 * but just truncate it to zero length, and record a request to unlink it after
 * the next checkpoint.  Additional segments can be unlinked immediately,
 * however.  Leaving the empty file in place prevents that relfilenumber
 * from being reused.  The scenario this protects us from is:
 * 1. We delete a relation (and commit, and actually remove its file).
 * 2. We create a new relation, which by chance gets the same relfilenumber as
 *	  the just-deleted one (OIDs must've wrapped around for that to happen).
 * 3. We crash before another checkpoint occurs.
 * During replay, we would delete the file and then recreate it, which is fine
 * if the contents of the file were repopulated by subsequent WAL entries.
 * But if we didn't WAL-log insertions, but instead relied on fsyncing the
 * file after populating it (as we do at wal_level=minimal), the contents of
 * the file would be lost forever.  By leaving the empty file until after the
 * next checkpoint, we prevent reassignment of the relfilenumber until it's
 * safe, because relfilenumber assignment skips over any existing file.
 *
 * Additional segments, if any, are truncated and then unlinked.  The reason
 * for truncating is that other backends may still hold open FDs for these at
 * the smgr level, so that the kernel can't remove the file yet.  We want to
 * reclaim the disk space right away despite that.
 *
 * We do not need to go through this dance for temp relations, though, because
 * we never make WAL entries for temp rels, and so a temp rel poses no threat
 * to the health of a regular rel that has taken over its relfilenumber.
 * The fact that temp rels and regular rels have different file naming
 * patterns provides additional safety.  Other backends shouldn't have open
 * FDs for them, either.
 *
 * We also don't do it while performing a binary upgrade.  There is no reuse
 * hazard in that case, since after a crash or even a simple ERROR, the
 * upgrade fails and the whole cluster must be recreated from scratch.
 * Furthermore, it is important to remove the files from disk immediately,
 * because we may be about to reuse the same relfilenumber.
 *
 * All the above applies only to the relation's main fork; other forks can
 * just be removed immediately, since they are not needed to prevent the
 * relfilenumber from being recycled.  Also, we do not carefully
 * track whether other forks have been created or not, but just attempt to
 * unlink them unconditionally; so we should never complain about ENOENT.
 *
 * If isRedo is true, it's unsurprising for the relation to be already gone.
 * Also, we should remove the file immediately instead of queuing a request
 * for later, since during redo there's no possibility of creating a
 * conflicting relation.
 *
 * Note: we currently just never warn about ENOENT at all.  We could warn in
 * the main-fork, non-isRedo case, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble.
 *
 * Note: any failure should be reported as WARNING not ERROR, because
 * we are usually not in a transaction anymore when this is called.
