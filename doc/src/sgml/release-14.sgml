     <para>
      Fix default signature length for <literal>gist_ltree_ops</literal>
      indexes (Tomas Vondra, Alexander Korotkov)
     </para>

     <para>
      The default signature length (hash size) for GiST indexes
      on <type>ltree</type> columns was accidentally changed while
      upgrading that operator class to support operator class parameters.
      If any operations had been done on such an index without first
      upgrading the <literal>ltree</literal> extension to version 1.2,
      they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes
      rather than the intended 8.  This means it is very likely that such
      indexes are now corrupt.  For safety we recommend re-indexing all
      GiST indexes on <type>ltree</type> columns after installing this
      update.  (Note that GiST indexes on <type>ltree[]</type>
      columns, that is arrays of <type>ltree</type>, are not affected.)

      Stop using query-provided column aliases for the columns of
      whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such
      as <literal>tbl.*</literal> in contexts other than the top level of
      a <literal>SELECT</literal> list) are now always those of the
      associated named composite type, if there is one.  We'd previously
      attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been
      applied to the <literal>FROM</literal> entry the variable refers to.
      But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of
      the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be.
      Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up
      to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on
      the whole idea.
     </para>

     <para>
      In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns,
      a workaround is to introduce an extra level of
      sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>, so that the whole-row variable is
      referring to the sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>'s output and not to a
      plain table.  Then the variable is of type <type>record</type>
      to begin with and there's no issue.

      The previous coding could try to read non-returnable columns
      in addition to the returnable ones.  This was fairly harmless
      because it didn't actually do anything with the bogus values,
      but it fell foul of a recently-added error check that rejected
      such a plan.

      The code would touch the buffer a couple more times after releasing
      its pin.  In theory another process could recycle the buffer (or
      more likely, try to defragment its free space) as soon as the pin is
      gone, probably leading to failure to find the newer version of the
      tuple.

      Improve wait logic in RegisterSyncRequest (Thomas Munro)

     <para>
      If we run out of space in the checkpointer sync request queue (which
      is hopefully rare on real systems, but is common when testing with a
      very small buffer pool), we wait for it to drain.  While waiting, we
      should report that as a wait event so that users know what is going
      on, and also watch for postmaster death, since otherwise the loop might
      never terminate if the checkpointer has already exited.

      Perl can be convinced to execute user-defined code during compilation
      of a PL/Perl function.  However, it's not okay for such code to try
      to invoke SQL operations via SPI.  That results in a crash, and if
      it didn't crash it would be a security hazard, because we really
      don't want code execution during function validation.  Put in a
      check to give a friendlier error message instead.

      Fix behavior of <application>libpq</application>'s
      <function>PQisBusy()</function> function after a connection failure

     </para>

     <para>
      If we'd detected a write failure, <function>PQisBusy()</function>
      would always return true, which is the wrong thing: we want input
      processing to carry on normally until we've read whatever is
      available from the server.  The practical effect of this error is
      that applications using <application>libpq</application>'s
      async-query API would typically detect connection loss only
      when <function>PQconsumeInput()</function> returns a hard failure.
      With this fix, a connection loss will normally be reported via an
      error <structname>PGresult</structname> object, which is a much
      cleaner behavior for most applications.

      Make <application>pg_ctl</application> recheck postmaster aliveness
      while waiting for stop/restart/promote actions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_ctl</application> would verify that the postmaster
      is alive as a side-effect of sending the stop or promote signal, but
      then it just naively waited to see the on-disk state change.  If the
      postmaster died uncleanly without having removed its PID file or
      updated the control file, <application>pg_ctl</application> would
      wait until timeout.  Instead make it recheck every so often that the
      postmaster process is still there.

      Prevent extra expansion of shell wildcard patterns in programs built

      wildcard characters in a program's command-line arguments by
      default.  This is confusing, not least because it doesn't happen
      under MSVC, so turn it off.

      Enforce standard locking protocol for TOAST table updates, to prevent
      problems with <command>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> (Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      If applied to a TOAST table or TOAST table's index, <command>REINDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</command> tended to produce a corrupted index.  This
      happened because sessions updating TOAST entries released
      their <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> locks immediately, rather
      than holding them until transaction commit as all other updates do.
      The fix is to make TOAST updates hold the table lock according to the
      normal rule.  Any existing corrupted indexes can be repaired by
      reindexing again.

      Fix corruption of HOT chains when a RECENTLY_DEAD tuple changes
      state to fully DEAD during page pruning (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      It was possible for <command>VACUUM</command> to remove a
      recently-dead tuple while leaving behind a redirect item that
      pointed to it.  When the tuple's item slot is later re-used by
      some new tuple, that tuple would be seen as part of the
      pre-existing HOT chain, creating a form of index corruption.
      If this has happened, reindexing the table should repair the
      damage.  However, this is an extremely low-probability scenario,
      so we do not recommend reindexing just on the chance that it might
      have happened.

      If an index has both returnable and non-returnable columns, and one
      of the non-returnable columns is an expression using a table column
      that appears in a returnable index column, then a query using that
      expression could result in an index-only scan plan that attempts to
      read the non-returnable column, instead of recomputing the
      expression from the returnable column as intended.  The
      non-returnable column would read as NULL, resulting in wrong query
      results.

      Build extended statistics for partitioned tables (Justin Pryzby)
     </para>

     <para>
      A previous bug fix disabled building of extended statistics for
      old-style inheritance trees, but it also prevented building them for
      partitioned tables, which was an unnecessary restriction.
      This change allows <command>ANALYZE</command> to compute values for
      statistics objects for partitioned tables.  (But note that
      autovacuum does not process partitioned tables as such, so you must

      Ignore extended statistics for inheritance trees (Justin Pryzby)
     </para>

     <para>
      Currently, extended statistics values are only computed locally for
      each table, not for entire inheritance trees.  However the values
      were mistakenly consulted when planning queries across inheritance
      trees, possibly resulting in worse-than-default estimates.

     <para>
      Index-only scans returned column values with trailing spaces
      removed, which is not the expected behavior.  That happened because
      that's how the data was stored in the index.  This fix changes the
      code to store <type>char(<replaceable>N</replaceable>)</type> values
      with the expected amount of space padding.
      The behavior of such an index will not change immediately unless
      you <command>REINDEX</command> it; otherwise space-stripped values
      will be gradually replaced over time during updates.  Queries that
      do not use index-only scan plans will be unaffected in any case.

      Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
      although that would only work if the server did not demand any
      authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
      authentication might well not do so.)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the
      client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's
      behavior make that harder than it sounds.  A different line of
      attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive
      data that might be sent early in the session.  That has been shown
      to be possible with a server vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214.

      Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes
      after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record
      (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the
      rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery
      logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning
      of the incomplete WAL record.  This is problematic since standby
      servers may already have copies of that WAL segment.  They will then
      see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover
      without manual intervention.  To fix, do not back up over a WAL
      segment boundary when restarting after a crash.  Instead write a new
      type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing
      readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and
      must be disregarded.
     </para>

     <para>
      When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers
      before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new
      WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.

      Ensure that parallel <command>VACUUM</command> doesn't miss any
      indexes (Peter Geoghegan, Masahiko Sawada)
     </para>

     <para>
      A parallel <command>VACUUM</command> would fail to process indexes
      that are below the <varname>min_parallel_index_scan_size</varname>
      cutoff, if the table also has at least two indexes that are above
      that size.  This could result in those indexes becoming corrupt,
      since they'd still contain references to any heap entries removed by
      the <command>VACUUM</command>; subsequent queries using such indexes
      would be likely to return rows they shouldn't.
      This problem does not affect autovacuum, since it doesn't use
      parallel vacuuming.  However, it is advisable to reindex any
      manually-vacuumed tables that have the right mix of index sizes.

     <para>
      Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from
      the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such

     <para>
      <literal>FETCH FIRST WITH TIES</literal> necessarily fetches one

      that is not a tie.  In our current implementation,
      if <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> is used then that row will also get
      locked even though it is not returned.  That results in undesirable
      behavior if the <literal>SKIP LOCKED</literal> option is specified.
      It's difficult to change this without introducing a different set of
      undesirable behaviors, so for now, forbid the combination.

     </para>

     <para>
      These changes fix slow processing in several scenarios, including:
      when a standby replays a transaction that held many exclusive locks
      on the primary; when many files are due to be unlinked after a
      checkpoint; when hash aggregation involves many batches; and when
      <filename>pg_trgm</filename> extracts indexable conditions from a
      complex regular expression.  Only the first of these scenarios has
      actually been reported from the field, but they all seem like
      plausible consequences of inefficient list deletions.

      Use the CLDR project's data to map Windows time zone names to IANA
      time zones (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      When running on Windows, <application>initdb</application> attempts
      to set the new cluster's <varname>timezone</varname> parameter to
      the IANA time zone matching the system's prevailing time zone.
      We were using a mapping table that we'd generated years ago and
      updated only fitfully; unsurprisingly, it contained a number of
      errors as well as omissions of recently-added zones.  It turns out
      that CLDR has been tracking the most appropriate mappings, so start
      using their data.  This change will not affect any existing
      installation, only newly-initialized clusters.
