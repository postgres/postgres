      Fix cases where a logical replication
      slot's <structfield>restart_lsn</structfield> could go backwards
      (Masahiko Sawada)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;26c4e8968">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, restarting logical replication could sometimes cause the
      slot's restart point to be recomputed as an older value than had
      previously been advertised
      in <structname>pg_replication_slots</structname>.  This is bad,
      since for example WAL files might have been removed on the basis of
      the later <structfield>restart_lsn</structfield> value, in which
      case replication would fail to restart.

      Avoid deleting still-needed WAL files
      during <application>pg_rewind</application>
      (Polina Bungina, Alexander Kukushkin)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;ba2535841">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, in unlucky cases, it was possible
      for <application>pg_rewind</application> to remove important WAL
      files from the rewound demoted primary.  In particular this happens
      if those files have been marked for archival (i.e.,
      their <filename>.ready</filename> files were created) but not yet
      archived.  Then the newly promoted node no longer has such files
      because of them having been recycled, but likely they are needed
      for recovery in the demoted node.
      If <application>pg_rewind</application> removes them, recovery is
      not possible anymore.

      Ensure cached plans are marked as dependent on the calling role when
      RLS applies to a non-top-level table reference (Nathan Bossart)

     <para>
      If a CTE, subquery, sublink, security invoker view, or coercion
      projection in a query references a table with row-level security
      policies, we neglected to mark the resulting plan as potentially
      dependent on which role is executing it.  This could lead to later
      query executions in the same session using the wrong plan, and then
      returning or hiding rows that should have been hidden or returned
      instead.

      Make <application>libpq</application> discard error messages
      received during SSL or GSS protocol negotiation (Jacob Champion)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;e6c945476">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      An error message received before encryption negotiation is completed
      might have been injected by a man-in-the-middle, rather than being
      real server output.  Reporting it opens the door to various security
      hazards; for example, the message might spoof a query result that a
      careless user could mistake for correct output.  The best answer
      seems to be to discard such data and rely only
      on <application>libpq</application>'s own report of the connection
      failure.

      Fix unintended interactions between <command>SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</command> and <command>SET ROLE</command> (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;2a68808e2">&sect;</ulink>
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;00b94e8e2">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard mandates that <command>SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</command> have a side-effect of doing <command>SET
      ROLE NONE</command>.  Our implementation of that was flawed,
      creating more interaction between the two settings than intended.
      Notably, rolling back a transaction that had done <command>SET
      SESSION AUTHORIZATION</command> would revert <literal>ROLE</literal>
      to <literal>NONE</literal> even if that had not been the previous
      state, so that the effective user ID might now be different from
      what it had been before the transaction.  Transiently
      setting <varname>session_authorization</varname> in a
      function <literal>SET</literal> clause had a similar effect.
      A related bug was that if a parallel worker
      inspected <literal>current_setting('role')</literal>, it
      saw <literal>none</literal> even when it should see something else.

      Fix updates of catalog state for foreign-key constraints when
      attaching or detaching table partitions (Jehan-Guillaume de
      Rorthais, Tender Wang, Álvaro Herrera)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;46a8c27a7">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If the referenced table is partitioned, then different catalog
      entries are needed for a referencing table that is stand-alone
      versus one that is a partition.  <literal>ATTACH/DETACH
      PARTITION</literal> commands failed to perform this conversion
      correctly.  In particular, after <literal>DETACH</literal> the now
      stand-alone table would be missing foreign-key enforcement triggers,
      which could result in the table later containing rows that fail the
      foreign-key constraint.  A subsequent re-<literal>ATTACH</literal>
      could fail with surprising errors, too.
     </para>

     <para>
      The way to fix this is to do <command>ALTER TABLE DROP
      CONSTRAINT</command> on the now stand-alone table for each faulty
      constraint, and then re-add the constraint.  If re-adding the
      constraint fails, then some erroneous data has crept in.  You will
      need to manually re-establish consistency between the referencing
      and referenced tables, then re-add the constraint.
     </para>

     <para>
      This query can be used to identify broken constraints and construct
      the commands needed to recreate them:
<programlisting>
SELECT conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS "constrained table",
       conname AS constraint,
       confrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS "references",
       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s DROP CONSTRAINT %I;',
                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname) AS "drop",
       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s ADD CONSTRAINT %I %s;',
                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname,
                         pg_catalog.pg_get_constraintdef(oid)) AS "add"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c
WHERE contype = 'f' AND conparentid = 0 AND
   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c2
    WHERE c2.conparentid = c.oid) &lt;&gt;
   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_inherits i
    WHERE (i.inhparent = c.conrelid OR i.inhparent = c.confrelid) AND
      EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_partitioned_table
              WHERE partrelid = i.inhparent));
</programlisting>
      Since it is possible that one or more of the <literal>ADD
      CONSTRAINT</literal> steps will fail, you should save the query's
      output in a file and then attempt to perform each step.

      After repartitioning the inner side of a hash join because one
      partition has accumulated too many tuples, we check to see if all
      the partition's tuples went into the same child partition, which
      suggests that they all have the same hash value and further
      repartitioning cannot improve matters.  This check malfunctioned in
      some cases, allowing repeated futile repartitioning which would
      eventually end in a resource-exhaustion error.

     <para>
      Normal row updates write a new version of the row to preserve
      rollback-ability of the transaction.  However, certain system
      catalog updates are intentionally non-transactional and are done
      with an in-place update of the row.  These patches fix race
      conditions that could cause the effects of an in-place update to be
      lost.  As an example, it was possible to forget having set
      <structname>pg_class</structname>.<structfield>relhasindex</structfield>
      to true, preventing updates of the new index and thus causing index
      corruption.

      This case arose while trying to print references to fields of a
      RECORD-type output of a subquery when the subquery has been
      optimized out of the plan altogether (which is possible at least in
      the case that it has a constant-false <literal>WHERE</literal>
      condition).  Nothing remains in the plan to identify the original
      field names, so fall back to
      printing <literal>f<replaceable>N</replaceable></literal> for
      the <replaceable>N</replaceable>'th record column.  (That's actually
      the right thing anyway, if the record output arose from

      Re-disable sending of stateless (TLSv1.2) session tickets
      (Daniel Gustafsson)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;8cea8c023">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      A previous change to prevent sending of stateful (TLSv1.3) session
      tickets accidentally re-enabled sending of stateless ones.  Thus,
      while we intended to prevent clients from thinking that TLS session
      resumption is supported, some still did.

      Update time zone data files to <application>tzdata</application>

     </para>

     <para>
      This <application>tzdata</application> release changes the old
      System-V-compatibility zone names to duplicate the corresponding
      geographic zones; for example <literal>PST8PDT</literal> is now an
      alias for <literal>America/Los_Angeles</literal>.  The main visible
      consequence is that for timestamps before the introduction of
      standardized time zones, the zone is considered to represent local
      mean solar time for the named location.  For example,
      in <literal>PST8PDT</literal>, <type>timestamptz</type> input such
      as <literal>1801-01-01 00:00</literal> would previously have been
      rendered as <literal>1801-01-01 00:00:00-08</literal>, but now it is
      rendered as <literal>1801-01-01 00:00:00-07:52:58</literal>.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, historical corrections for Mexico, Mongolia, and Portugal.
      Notably, <literal>Asia/Choibalsan</literal> is now an alias
      for <literal>Asia/Ulaanbaatar</literal> rather than being a separate
      zone, mainly because the differences between those zones were found to
      be based on untrustworthy data.

      Prevent unauthorized code execution

     </para>

     <para>
      An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could
      inject SQL code that would be executed by a
      concurrent <application>pg_dump</application> session with the
      privileges of the role running <application>pg_dump</application>
      (which is often a superuser).  The attack involves replacing a
      sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will
      execute malicious code.  To prevent this, introduce a new server
      parameter <varname>restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind</varname> that
      can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to
      foreign tables, and teach <application>pg_dump</application> to set
      it when available.  Note that the attack is prevented only if
      both <application>pg_dump</application> and the server it is dumping
      from are new enough to have this fix.

      An in-place update occurring while we expand out-of-line fields in a

      In some cases the aggregate result computed at one row of the outer
      query could be re-used for later rows when it should not be.  This
      has only been seen to happen when the outer query uses
      <literal>DISTINCT</literal> that is implemented with hash
      aggregation, but other cases may exist.

      Avoid crashing when a JIT-inlined backend function throws an error
      (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;13abc1f66">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The error state can include pointers into the dynamically loaded
      module holding the JIT-compiled code (for error location strings).
      In some code paths the module could get unloaded before the error
      report is processed, leading to SIGSEGV when the location strings
      are accessed.

     <para>
      When starting a standby's replay at a shutdown checkpoint WAL
      record, transactions that had been prepared but not yet committed on
      the primary are correctly understood as being still in progress.
      But subtransactions of a prepared transaction (created by savepoints
      or <application>PL/pgSQL</application> exception blocks) were not
      accounted for and would be treated as aborted.  That led to
      inconsistency if the prepared transaction was later committed.

      These views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve
      columns the accessing user does not have permission to read.  View
      columns such as <structfield>most_common_vals</structfield> might
      expose security-relevant data.  The potential interactions here are
      not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety,
      make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated
      table.

      The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> Project thanks
      Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem.
      (CVE-2024-4317)
     </para>

     <para>
      By itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      database clusters.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing
      cluster, you will need to do the following:
     </para>

     <procedure>
      <step>
       <para>
        Find the SQL script <filename>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</filename> in
        the <replaceable>share</replaceable> directory of
        the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation (typically
        located someplace like <filename>/usr/share/postgresql/</filename>).
        Be sure to use the script appropriate to
        your <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> major version.
        If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable
        (only v14&ndash;v16 are affected) or your minor version is too
        old to have the fix.
       </para>
      </step>

      <step>
       <para>
        In <emphasis>each</emphasis> database of the cluster, run
        the <filename>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</filename> script as superuser.
        In <application>psql</application> this would look like
<programlisting>
\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql
</programlisting>
        (adjust the file path as appropriate).  Any error probably indicates
        that you've used the wrong script version.  It will not hurt to run
        the script more than once.
       </para>
      </step>

      <step>
       <para>
        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</literal>
        and <literal>template1</literal> databases, or the vulnerability
        will still exist in databases you create later.  To
        fix <literal>template0</literal>, you'll need to temporarily make
        it accept connections.  Do that with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</literal>, undo it with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

      Avoid deadlock during removal of orphaned temporary tables

     </para>

     <para>
      If the session that creates a temporary table crashes without
      removing the table, autovacuum will eventually try to remove the
      orphaned table.  However, an incoming session that's been assigned
      the same temporary namespace will do that too.  If a temporary table
      has a dependency (such as an owned sequence) then a deadlock could
      result between these two cleanup attempts.

     </para>

     <para>
      In versions before <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 16, it was
      possible for generated conditions to be evaluated below outer joins
      when they should be evaluated above (after) the outer join, leading
      to incorrect query results.  All versions have a similar hazard when
      considering joins to <command>UNION ALL</command> trees that have
      constant outputs for the join column in
      some <command>SELECT </command> arms.

      Avoid unnecessary use of moving-aggregate mode with a non-moving
      window frame (Vallimaharajan G)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;0d30e48c2">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      When a plain aggregate is used as a window function, and the window
      frame start is specified as <literal>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</literal>,
      the frame's head cannot move so we do not need to use the special
      (and more expensive) moving-aggregate mode.  This optimization was
      intended all along, but due to a coding error it never triggered.

      Disconnect if a new server session's client socket cannot be put

     <para>
      It was once theoretically possible for us to operate with a socket
      that's in blocking mode; but that hasn't worked fully in a long
      time, so fail at connection start rather than misbehave later.

   <title>Migration to Version 14.11</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, one bug was fixed that could have resulted in corruption of
    GIN indexes during concurrent updates.  If you suspect such
    corruption, reindex affected indexes after installing this update.
   </para>

    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.10,
    see <xref linkend="release-14-10"/>.

      Tighten security restrictions within <command>REFRESH MATERIALIZED

     </para>

     <para>
      One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
      restrictions.  If a materialized view's owner could persuade a
      superuser or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent
      refresh on that view, the view's owner could control code executed
      with the privileges of the user running <command>REFRESH</command>.
      Fix things so that all user-determined code is run as the view's
      owner, as expected.

      outside the outer join's scope.  The output column might not appear
      as NULL when it should do so due to the action of the outer join.

      Prevent access to a no-longer-pinned buffer in <literal>BEFORE ROW

      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;c7edaeec5">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If the tuple being updated had just been updated and moved to
      another page by another session, there was a narrow window where
      we would attempt to fetch data from the new tuple version without
      any pin on its buffer.  In principle this could result in garbage
      data appearing in non-updated columns of the proposed new tuple.
      The odds of problems in practice seem rather low, however.

      Detect that a new catalog cache entry became stale while detoasting
      its fields (Tom Lane)

      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;7ceeb57ba">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      We expand any out-of-line fields in a catalog tuple before inserting
      it into the catalog caches.  That involves database access which
      might cause invalidation of catalog cache entries &mdash; but the
      new entry isn't in the cache yet, so we would miss noticing that it
      should get invalidated.  The result is a race condition in which an
      already-stale cache entry could get made, and then persist
      indefinitely.  This would lead to hard-to-predict misbehavior.
      Fix by rechecking the tuple's visibility after detoasting.

     <para>
      Computing <literal>0 - INT64_MIN</literal> should result in an
      overflow error, and did on most platforms.  However, platforms with
      neither integer overflow builtins nor 128-bit integers would fail to
      spot the overflow, instead returning <literal>INT64_MIN</literal>.

      Prevent standby servers from incorrectly processing dead index

     </para>

     <para>
      The <structfield>startedInRecovery</structfield> flag was not
      correctly set for a subtransaction.  This affects only processing of
      dead index tuples.  It could allow a query in a subtransaction to
      ignore index entries that it should return (if they are already dead
      on the primary server, but not dead to the standby transaction), or
      to prematurely mark index entries as dead that are not yet dead on
      the primary.  It is not clear that the latter case has any serious
      consequences, but it's not the intended behavior.

      Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during

     <para>
      If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies
      system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to
      fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.
      This fix deals with the case that a top-level transaction is already
      marked as containing catalog changes, but its subtransaction(s) are
      not.

      The pipeline state could get out of sync if an error is returned
      for reasons other than a query problem (for example, if the

      Previously, commands would be included in the dump to set these

      considered as internal affairs of the extension.  Moreover, the
      restoring user might not have adequate privilege to set them, and
      indeed the dumping user might not have enough privilege to dump them
      (since dumping RLS policies requires acquiring lock on their table).

      Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions

     <para>
      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in
      edge cases.  Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for
      arbitrary code execution are possible, and so is disclosure of
      server memory.

      Prevent the <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal> role from

      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;ecd5d240c">&sect;</ulink>

     <para>
      The documentation says that <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal>
      cannot issue signals to superuser-owned processes.  It was able to
      signal these background processes, though, because they advertise a
      role OID of zero.  Treat that as indicating superuser ownership.
      The security implications of cancelling one of these process types
      are fairly small so far as the core code goes (we'll just start
      another one), but extensions might add background workers that are
      more vulnerable.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also ensure that the <varname>is_superuser</varname> parameter is
      set correctly in such processes.  No specific security consequences
      are known for that oversight, but it might be significant for some
      extensions.

      Fix a case where the location of a page downlink was incorrectly

      Prevent de-duplication of btree index entries

     <para>
      There are <type>interval</type> values that are distinguishable but

      and <literal>1 day</literal>.  This breaks assumptions made by btree
      de-duplication, so <type>interval</type> columns need to be excluded
      from de-duplication.  This oversight can cause incorrect results
      from index-only scans.  Moreover, after
      updating <application>amcheck</application> will report an error for
      almost all such indexes.  Users should reindex any btree indexes
      on <type>interval</type> columns.

      Infinities were mistakenly treated as having distance zero rather
      than a large distance from other values, causing poor decisions
      about which entries to merge.  Also, finite-but-very-large values
      (near the endpoints of the representable timestamp range) could
      result in internal overflows, again causing poor decisions.  The
      index still produces correct results, but is much less efficient
      than it should be.  Reindexing BRIN <literal>minmax_multi</literal>
      indexes on <type>timestamp</type> and <type>timestamptz</type>

      infinities or large finite values.

      of <varname>track_activity_query_size</varname> large enough to
      cause 32-bit overflow when multiplied by the allowed number of
      connections.  The code actually allocating the per-backend local
      array was careless about this though, and allocated the array
      incorrectly.

     <para>
      Presence of this abbreviation in the default list can cause failures
      on recent Debian and Ubuntu releases, as they no longer install the
      underlying tzdb entry by default.  Since this is a made-up
      abbreviation for a zone with a total human population of about two
      dozen, it seems unlikely that anyone will miss it.  If someone does,
      they can put it back via a custom abbreviations file.

      Fix confusion between empty (no rows) ranges and all-NULL ranges in
      BRIN indexes, as well as incorrect merging of all-NULL summaries

      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;3f1356e5d">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Each of these oversights could result in forgetting that a BRIN
      index range contains any NULL values, potentially allowing
      subsequent queries that should return NULL values to miss doing so.
     </para>

     <para>
      This fix will not in itself correct faulty BRIN entries.
      It's recommended to <command>REINDEX</command> any BRIN indexes that
      may be used to search for nulls.

      Avoid leaving a corrupted database behind when <command>DROP
      DATABASE</command> is interrupted (Andres Freund)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;d11efe830">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If <command>DROP DATABASE</command> was interrupted after it had
      already begun taking irreversible steps, the target database
      remained accessible (because the removal of
      its <structname>pg_database</structname> row would roll back),
      but it would have corrupt contents.  Fix by marking the database
      as inaccessible before we begin to perform irreversible operations.
      A failure after that will leave the database still partially
      present, but nothing can be done with it except to issue
      another <command>DROP DATABASE</command>.

     <para>
      While an unlogged index's main data fork is not WAL-logged, its init
      fork should be, to ensure that we have a consistent state to restore
      the index to after a crash.  This step was missed if the init fork
      contains no data, which is a case not used by any standard index AM;
      but perhaps some extension behaves that way.

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having

      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role.

     <para>
      Most cases in which a syntax error is detected in a string literal
      within a JSON value failed to set the error cursor appropriately.
      This led at least to an unhelpful error message (pointing to the
      token before the string, rather than the actual trouble spot), and
      could even result in a crash in v14 and later.

     <para>
      In v14 and later with non-default settings
      of <varname>vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</varname>, it was possible to
      compute a very large vacuum cleanup horizon xid, leading to vacuum
      removing rows that are still live.  v12 and v13 have a lesser form
      of the same problem affecting only GiST indexes, which could lead to
      index pages getting recycled too early.

      In the unusual case where the size of a large (&gt;8kB) palloc chunk
      is decreased, a Valgrind-aware build would mismark the defined-ness
      state of the memory released from the chunk, possibly causing
      incorrect results during Valgrind testing.

      Fix <application>pg_dump</application> so that partitioned tables
      that are hash-partitioned on an enum-type column can be restored
      successfully (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;5fc1ac151">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the hash codes for enum values depend on the OIDs assigned to
      the enum, they are typically different after a dump and restore,
      meaning that rows often need to go into a different partition than
      they were in originally.  Users can work around that by specifying
      the <option>--load-via-partition-root</option> option; but since
      there is very little chance of success without that,
      teach <application>pg_dump</application> to apply it automatically
      to such tables.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, fix <application>pg_restore</application> to not try
      to <command>TRUNCATE</command> target tables before restoring into
      them when <option>--load-via-partition-root</option> mode is used.
      This avoids a hazard of deadlocks and lost data.

      Fix misbehavior in <filename>contrib/pg_trgm</filename> with an
      unsatisfiable regular expression (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;786528039">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      A regex such as <literal>$foo</literal> is legal but unsatisfiable;
      the regex compiler recognizes that and produces an empty NFA graph.
      Attempting to optimize such a graph into a pg_trgm GIN or GiST index
      qualification resulted in accessing off the end of a work array,
      possibly leading to crashes.

      <application>libpq</application> can leak memory contents after
      GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;626f2c1d6">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can
      send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI
      (Kerberos) transport encryption.  <application>libpq</application>
      will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in
      application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report.
      Depending on what the calling application does with the error
      report, this could result in disclosure of application memory
      contents.  There is also a small probability of a crash due to
      reading beyond the end of memory.  Fix by properly zero-terminating
      the server message.

      Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length
      (Andrey Borodin)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;6900aea67">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The server would process a cancel request even if its length word
      was too small.  This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated
      buffer.  In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite
      unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be
      very close to the end of memory.  The more likely outcome was a bogus
      log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code.  Complain about
      the wrong length, instead.

     <para>
      A contrived query can result in deep recursion and unreasonable
      amounts of time spent trying to flatten subqueries.  A proper fix
      for that seems unduly invasive for a back-patch, but we can at least
      add stack depth checks and an interrupt check to allow the query to
      be cancelled.

     <para>
      Failure to do this left the page possibly different on standby
      servers than the primary, and violated some other expectations about
      when the LSN changes.  This seems only a theoretical hazard so
      far as <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> itself is concerned,

     </para>

     <para>
      While creating a partitioned index, we try to identify any existing
      indexes on the partitions that match the partitioned index, so that
      we can absorb those as child indexes instead of building new ones.
      Matching of expressions was not done right, so that a usable child
      index might be ignored, leading to creation of a duplicative index.

      Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL
      functions (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;95bfadd4e">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one
      place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify
      read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would
      observe the wrong value.  (Within
      core <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, the expanded-datum
      mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but
      extensions might use it for other structured types.)

      In Snowball dictionaries, don't try to stem excessively-long words
      (Olly Betts, Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;e969f1ae2">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If the input word exceeds 1000 bytes, return it as-is after case
      folding, rather than trying to run it through the Snowball code.
      This restriction protects against a known
      recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it
      seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance
      issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers.  Such a long string
      is surely not a word in any human language, so it's doubtful that
      the stemmer would have done anything desirable with it anyway.

     <para>
      Improper memory management in the string comparison functions
      could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers,
      potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory

      1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.

      This occurred if <application>pg_stat_statements</application>
      tracked a <command>ROLLBACK</command> command issued via extended
      query protocol.  In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion
      failure.  In production builds there would often be no visible ill
      effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely
      result would be to store garbage for the query string.

     <para>
      The <application>uuid-ossp</application> module expects
      libc's <function>uuid_create()</function> to produce a version-1
      UUID, but recent NetBSD releases produce a version-4 (random) UUID
      instead.  Check for that, and complain if so.  Drop the
      documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable
      for <application>uuid-ossp</application>.
      (If a version-4 UUID is okay for your purposes, you don't
      need <application>uuid-ossp</application> at all; just

     <para>
      Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby,
      more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970:
      Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei,
      Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam,
      Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo,
      Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen,
      Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti,
      Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis.
      (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of
      these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland,
      Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.)  America/Nipigon,
      America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and
      Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after
      discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those
      zones seem to have been errors.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias;
      but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.
     </para>

     <para>
      These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for
      the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications
      expecting consistency of <type>timestamptz</type> display.  As an
      example, the stored value <literal>1944-06-01 12:00 UTC</literal>
      would previously display as <literal>1944-06-01
      13:00:00+01</literal> if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but
      now it will read out as <literal>1944-06-01 14:00:00+02</literal>.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that
      will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot
      of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in
      more total changes from the previous release than accepting these
      upstream changes does.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
      chosen to ship the <productname>tzdb</productname> data
      as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating
      system distributions are doing likewise.  However, if these changes
      cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution
      is to install a local build of the time zone data files using
      <productname>tzdb</productname>'s backwards-compatibility options
      (see their <literal>PACKRATDATA</literal>
      and <literal>PACKRATLIST</literal> options).

      Do not let extension scripts replace objects not already belonging
      to the extension (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;5721da7e4">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents extension scripts from doing <command>CREATE
      OR REPLACE</command> if there is an existing object that does not
      belong to the extension.  It also prevents <command>CREATE IF NOT
      EXISTS</command> in the same situation.  This prevents a form of
      trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become
      the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise
      future uses of the object by other users.  As a side benefit, it
      also reduces the risk of accidentally replacing objects one did
      not mean to.

      Standby servers may encounter missing tablespace directories
      when replaying database-creation WAL records.  Prior to this
      patch, a standby would fail to recover in such a case;
      however, such directories could be legitimately missing.
      Create the tablespace (as a plain directory), then check that it
      has been dropped again once replay reaches a consistent state.

      Normally a Postgres tablespace is a symbolic link to a directory on
      some other filesystem.  This change allows it to just be a plain
      directory.  While this has no use for separating tables onto
      different filesystems, it is a convenient setup for testing.
      Moreover, it is necessary to support the <command>CREATE
      DATABASE</command> replay fix, which transiently creates a missing
      tablespace as an <quote>in place</quote> tablespace.

      In extended query protocol, force an immediate commit
      after <command>CREATE DATABASE</command> and other commands that
      can't run in a transaction block (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;3e1297a63">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If the client does not send a Sync message immediately after such a
      command, but instead sends another command, any failure in that
      command would lead to rolling back the preceding command, typically
      leaving inconsistent state on-disk (such as a missing or extra
      database directory).  The mechanisms intended to prevent that
      situation turn out to work for multiple commands in a simple-Query
      message, but not for a series of extended-protocol messages.  To
      prevent inconsistency without breaking use-cases that work today,
      force an implicit commit after such commands.

      Cases with more than about 1600 columns are unsupported, and
      have always failed at execution.  However, it emerges that some
      earlier code could be driven to assertion failures or crashes by
      queries with more than 32K columns.  Add a parse-time check to

     <para>
      Arrange to clean up after commit-time errors
      within <function>SPI_commit()</function>, rather than expecting
      callers to do that (Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;604651880">&sect;</ulink>
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;8657946d3">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Proper cleanup is complicated and requires use of low-level
      facilities, so it's not surprising that no known caller got it
      right.  This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure
      issued <command>COMMIT</command> but a failure occurred (such as a
      deferred constraint check).  To improve matters,
      redefine <function>SPI_commit()</function> as starting a new
      transaction, so that it becomes equivalent
      to <function>SPI_commit_and_chain()</function> except that you get
      default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior
      transaction's characteristics.  To make this somewhat transparent
      API-wise, redefine <function>SPI_start_transaction()</function> as a
      no-op.  All known callers of <function>SPI_commit()</function>
      immediately call <function>SPI_start_transaction()</function>, so
      they will not notice any change.  Similar remarks apply
      to <function>SPI_rollback()</function>.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all,
      resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter.  This is
      reported to crash Python 3.11.  Older Python releases leak some
      memory but seem okay with it otherwise.

      This mitigates a libc memory leak on AIX, and may offer some
      performance benefit everywhere.

      Version 14 changed some built-in functions to take
      type <type>anycompatiblearray</type> instead
      of <type>anyarray</type>.  While this is mostly transparent,
      user-defined aggregates and operators built atop these functions
      have to be declared with exactly matching types.  The presence of an
      object referencing the old signature will
      cause <application>pg_upgrade</application> to fail, so change it to
      detect and report such cases before beginning the upgrade.

      If a large transaction on the primary server sends no data to the

      possible for the standby to timeout.  Fix that by ensuring we send
      keepalive messages periodically in such situations.

      In the previous minor releases, we copied the server's permission

      not have also copied the server's file-ownership check.  While that
      works in normal use-cases, it can result in an unexpected failure
      for clients running as root, and perhaps in other cases.

      Fix default signature length for <literal>gist_ltree_ops</literal>
      indexes (Tomas Vondra, Alexander Korotkov)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;7d30f59da">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The default signature length (hash size) for GiST indexes
      on <type>ltree</type> columns was accidentally changed while
      upgrading that operator class to support operator class parameters.
      If any operations had been done on such an index without first
      upgrading the <literal>ltree</literal> extension to version 1.2,
      they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes
      rather than the intended 8.  This means it is very likely that such
      indexes are now corrupt.  For safety we recommend re-indexing all
      GiST indexes on <type>ltree</type> columns after installing this
      update.  (Note that GiST indexes on <type>ltree[]</type>
      columns, that is arrays of <type>ltree</type>, are not affected.)

      Stop using query-provided column aliases for the columns of
      whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;1d072bd20">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      The column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such
      as <literal>tbl.*</literal> in contexts other than the top level of
      a <literal>SELECT</literal> list) are now always those of the
      associated named composite type, if there is one.  We'd previously
      attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been
      applied to the <literal>FROM</literal> entry the variable refers to.
      But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of
      the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be.
      Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up
      to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on
      the whole idea.

      In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns,
      a workaround is to introduce an extra level of
      sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>, so that the whole-row variable is
      referring to the sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>'s output and not to a
      plain table.  Then the variable is of type <type>record</type>
      to begin with and there's no issue.

      Improve wait logic in RegisterSyncRequest (Thomas Munro)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;1396b5c6e">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If we run out of space in the checkpointer sync request queue (which
      is hopefully rare on real systems, but is common when testing with a
      very small buffer pool), we wait for it to drain.  While waiting, we
      should report that as a wait event so that users know what is going
      on, and also watch for postmaster death, since otherwise the loop might
      never terminate if the checkpointer has already exited.

     <para>
      An optimization added in v14 meant that if a server process somehow
      missed a timer interrupt, it would never again ask the kernel for
      another one, thus breaking timeout detection for the remainder of the
      session.  This seems unduly fragile, so add a recovery path.

     <para>
      Perl can be convinced to execute user-defined code during compilation
      of a PL/Perl function.  However, it's not okay for such code to try
      to invoke SQL operations via SPI.  That results in a crash, and if
      it didn't crash it would be a security hazard, because we really
      don't want code execution during function validation.  Put in a
      check to give a friendlier error message instead.

      Fix behavior of <application>libpq</application>'s

      (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;ae27b1acc">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If we'd detected a write failure, <function>PQisBusy()</function>
      would always return true, which is the wrong thing: we want input
      processing to carry on normally until we've read whatever is
      available from the server.  The practical effect of this error is
      that applications using <application>libpq</application>'s
      async-query API would typically detect connection loss only
      when <function>PQconsumeInput()</function> returns a hard failure.
      With this fix, a connection loss will normally be reported via an
      error <structname>PGresult</structname> object, which is a much
      cleaner behavior for most applications.

     <para>
      This is a legitimate edge case, but the module was mostly unprepared
      for it.  Arrange to return nulls, or no rows, as appropriate; that
      seems more useful than raising an error.

      This fix prevents situations where the remote server might sort in a

     <para>
      For some reason the C library provided by MinGW will expand shell
      wildcard characters in a program's command-line arguments by
      default.  This is confusing, not least because it doesn't happen
      under MSVC, so turn it off.

      Enforce standard locking protocol for TOAST table updates, to prevent
      problems with <command>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> (Michael Paquier)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;64ab21f0e">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      If applied to a TOAST table or TOAST table's index, <command>REINDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</command> tended to produce a corrupted index.  This
      happened because sessions updating TOAST entries released
      their <literal>ROW EXCLUSIVE</literal> locks immediately, rather
      than holding them until transaction commit as all other updates do.
      The fix is to make TOAST updates hold the table lock according to the
      normal rule.  Any existing corrupted indexes can be repaired by
      reindexing again.

      Fix corruption of HOT chains when a RECENTLY_DEAD tuple changes
      state to fully DEAD during page pruning (Andres Freund)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;dad1539ae">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      It was possible for <command>VACUUM</command> to remove a
      recently-dead tuple while leaving behind a redirect item that
      pointed to it.  When the tuple's item slot is later re-used by
      some new tuple, that tuple would be seen as part of the
      pre-existing HOT chain, creating a form of index corruption.
      If this has happened, reindexing the table should repair the
      damage.  However, this is an extremely low-probability scenario,
      so we do not recommend reindexing just on the chance that it might
      have happened.

      Build extended statistics for partitioned tables (Justin Pryzby)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;ea212bd95">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      A previous bug fix disabled building of extended statistics for
      old-style inheritance trees, but it also prevented building them for
      partitioned tables, which was an unnecessary restriction.
      This change allows <command>ANALYZE</command> to compute values for
      statistics objects for partitioned tables.  (But note that
      autovacuum does not process partitioned tables as such, so you must
      periodically issue manual <command>ANALYZE</command> on the
      partitioned table if you want to maintain such statistics.)

      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;2cc007fd0">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      Currently, extended statistics values are only computed locally for
      each table, not for entire inheritance trees.  However the values
      were mistakenly consulted when planning queries across inheritance
      trees, possibly resulting in worse-than-default estimates.

      Fix results of index-only scans

     <para>
      Index-only scans returned column values with trailing spaces
      removed, which is not the expected behavior.  That happened because
      that's how the data was stored in the index.  This fix changes the
      code to store <type>char(<replaceable>N</replaceable>)</type> values
      with the expected amount of space padding.
      The behavior of such an index will not change immediately unless
      you <command>REINDEX</command> it; otherwise space-stripped values
      will be gradually replaced over time during updates.  Queries that
      do not use index-only scan plans will be unaffected in any case.

      Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)
      <ulink url="&commit_baseurl;9d5a76b8d">&sect;</ulink>
     </para>

     <para>
      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
      although that would only work if the server did not demand any
      authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
      authentication might well not do so.)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the
      client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's
      behavior make that harder than it sounds.  A different line of
      attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive
      data that might be sent early in the session.  That has been shown
      to be possible with a server vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214.

      Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes
      after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record

     </para>

     <para>
      If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the
      rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery
      logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning
      of the incomplete WAL record.  This is problematic since standby
      servers may already have copies of that WAL segment.  They will then
      see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover
      without manual intervention.  To fix, do not back up over a WAL
      segment boundary when restarting after a crash.  Instead write a new
      type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing
      readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and
      must be disregarded.
     </para>

     <para>
      When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers
      before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new
      WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.

      Ensure that parallel <command>VACUUM</command> doesn't miss any

     </para>

     <para>
      A parallel <command>VACUUM</command> would fail to process indexes
      that are below the <varname>min_parallel_index_scan_size</varname>
      cutoff, if the table also has at least two indexes that are above
      that size.  This could result in those indexes becoming corrupt,
      since they'd still contain references to any heap entries removed by
      the <command>VACUUM</command>; subsequent queries using such indexes
      would be likely to return rows they shouldn't.
      This problem does not affect autovacuum, since it doesn't use
      parallel vacuuming.  However, it is advisable to reindex any
      manually-vacuumed tables that have the right mix of index sizes.

     <para>
      Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from

      &gt; 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes

     <para>
      If a procedure commits or rolls back a transaction, and then its
      next significant action is inside a new subtransaction, snapshot
      management went wrong, leading to a dangling pointer and probable
      crash.  A typical example in PL/pgSQL is a <literal>COMMIT</literal>
      immediately followed by a <literal>BEGIN ... EXCEPTION</literal>
      block that performs a query.

     <para>
      This oversight was usually pretty harmless, since
      once <application>pg_dump</application> has locked any of the leaf
      partitions, that would suffice to prevent significant DDL on the
      partitioned table itself.  However problems could ensue when dumping
