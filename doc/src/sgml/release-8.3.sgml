   <title>Migration to Version 8.3.8</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X.
    However, if you have any hash indexes on <type>interval</> columns,
    you must <command>REINDEX</> them after updating to 8.3.8.
    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.5,
    see the release notes for 8.3.5.

     <para>
      Fix Windows shared-memory allocation code (Tsutomu Yamada, Magnus)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug led to the often-reported <quote>could not reattach
      to shared memory</> error message.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Force WAL segment switch during <function>pg_start_backup()</>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disallow <command>RESET ROLE</> and <command>RESET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</> inside security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch that
      disallowed <command>SET ROLE</> and <command>SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION</> inside security-definer functions.
      (See CVE-2007-6600)

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Make <command>LOAD</> of an already-loaded loadable module
      into a no-op (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Formerly, <command>LOAD</> would attempt to unload and re-load the
      module, but this is unsafe and not all that useful.

     <para>
      This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval values.
      It also changes the contents of hash indexes on interval columns.
      If you have any such indexes, you must <command>REINDEX</> them
      after updating.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
      related failure scenarios.  The previous fixes were narrowly tailored
      for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that
      <emphasis>any</> error thrown by an encoding conversion function could
      potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the
      error.  The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding
      conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message,
      if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.
      (CVE-2009-0922)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disallow <command>CREATE CONVERSION</> with the wrong encodings
      for the specified conversion function (Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion failure.
      The previous change is a backstop to guard against other kinds of
      failures in the same area.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <function>xpath()</> to not modify the path expression unless
      necessary, and to make a saner attempt at it when necessary (Andrew)
     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard suggests that <function>xpath</> should work on data
      that is a document fragment, but <application>libxml</> doesn't support
      that, and indeed it's not clear that this is sensible according to the
      XPath standard.  <function>xpath</> attempted to work around this
      mismatch by modifying both the data and the path expression, but the
      modification was buggy and could cause valid searches to fail.  Now,
      <function>xpath</> checks whether the data is in fact a well-formed
      document, and if so invokes <application>libxml</> with no change to the
      data or path expression.  Otherwise, a different modification method
      that is somewhat less likely to fail is used.
     </para>

     <note>
      <para>
       The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory, and it
       seems likely that no real solution is possible.  This patch should
       therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking existing
       applications unnecessarily.  It is likely that
       <productname>PostgreSQL</> 8.4 will simply reject use of
       <function>xpath</> on data that is not a well-formed document.
      </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix core dump when <function>to_char()</> is given format codes that
      are inappropriate for the type of the data argument (Tom)
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible failure in text search when C locale is used with
      a multi-byte encoding (Teodor)
     </para>

      Crashes were possible on platforms where <type>wchar_t</> is narrower
      than <type>int</>; Windows in particular.

      email-like string containing multiple <literal>@</> characters (Heikki)

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix planner problem with sub-<command>SELECT</> in the output list
      of a larger subquery (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      The known symptom of this bug is a <quote>failed to locate grouping
      columns</> error that is dependent on the datatype involved;
      but there could be other issues as well.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix decompilation of <literal>CASE WHEN</> with an implicit coercion
      (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This mistake could lead to Assert failures in an Assert-enabled build,
      or an <quote>unexpected CASE WHEN clause</> error message in other
      cases, when trying to examine or dump a view.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      If <command>CLUSTER</> or a rewriting variant of <command>ALTER TABLE</>
      were executed by someone other than the table owner, the
      <structname>pg_type</> entry for the table's TOAST table would end up
      marked as owned by that someone.  This caused no immediate problems,
      since the permissions on the TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any
      ordinary database operation.  However, it could lead to unexpected
      failures if one later tried to drop the role that issued the command
      (in 8.1 or 8.2), or <quote>owner of data type appears to be invalid</>
      warnings from <application>pg_dump</> after having done so (in 8.3).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Change <command>UNLISTEN</> to exit quickly if the current session has
      never executed any <command>LISTEN</> command (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Most of the time this is not a particularly useful optimization, but
      since <command>DISCARD ALL</> invokes <command>UNLISTEN</>, the previous
      coding caused a substantial performance problem for applications that
      made heavy use of <command>DISCARD ALL</>.
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix PL/pgSQL to not treat <literal>INTO</> after <command>INSERT</> as
      an INTO-variables clause anywhere in the string, not only at the start;
      in particular, don't fail for <command>INSERT INTO</> within
      <command>CREATE RULE</> (Tom)

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Clean up PL/pgSQL error status variables fully at block exit
      (Ashesh Vashi and Dave Page)
     </para>

     <para>
      This is not a problem for PL/pgSQL itself, but the omission could cause
      the PL/pgSQL Debugger to crash while examining the state of a function.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Retry failed calls to <function>CallNamedPipe()</> on Windows
      (Steve Marshall, Magnus)
     </para>

     <para>
      It appears that this function can sometimes fail transiently;
      we previously treated any failure as a hard error, which could
      confuse <command>LISTEN</>/<command>NOTIFY</> as well as other
      operations.

     <para>
      Previously, large field values in a cursor result might be represented
      as TOAST pointers, which would fail if the referenced table got dropped
      before the cursor is read, or if the large value is deleted and then
      vacuumed away.  This cannot happen with an ordinary cursor,

      Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a localized

     <para>
      We have addressed similar issues before, but it would still fail if
      the <quote>character has no equivalent</> message itself couldn't

      Cases in which there are query variables on the right-hand side had been

     <para>
      This error created a risk of corruption in system
      catalogs that are consulted by <command>VACUUM</>: dead tuple versions
      might be removed too soon.  The impact of this on actual database

     <para>
      The timestamp input functions have always resolved ambiguous zone names
      in this order.  Making <literal>AT TIME ZONE</> do so as well improves
      consistency, and fixes a compatibility bug introduced in 8.1:
      in ambiguous cases we now behave the same as 8.0 and before did,

      Make <function>pg_get_ruledef()</> parenthesize negative constants (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be dumped
      as, say, <literal>-42::integer</>, which is subtly incorrect: it should
      be <literal>(-42)::integer</> due to operator precedence rules.
      Usually this would make little difference, but it could interact with
      another recent patch to cause
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> to reject what had been a valid
      <command>SELECT DISTINCT</> view query.  Since this could result in
      <application>pg_dump</> output failing to reload, it is being treated
      as a high-priority fix.  The only released versions in which dump

     <para>
      Fix <literal>ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exceeded</literal> crash that

      client encoding (Tom)
     </para>

      Fix incorrect archive truncation point calculation for the

      (Simon)

     <para>
      This could lead to data loss if a warm-standby script relied on

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <command>ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY</> so that the new
      column is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
      non-nulls (Brendan Jurd)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previous versions neglected to check this requirement at all.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <command>REASSIGN OWNED</> so that it works on procedural
      languages too (Alvaro)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix problems with <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE</> occurring as a

      (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible <command>CREATE TABLE</> failure when inheriting the
      <quote>same</> constraint from multiple parent relations that
      inherited that constraint from a common ancestor (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix <function>pg_get_ruledef()</> to show the alias, if any, attached
      to the target table of an <command>UPDATE</> or <command>DELETE</>
      (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Restore the pre-8.3 behavior that an out-of-range block number in a
      TID being used in a TidScan plan results in silently not matching any
      rows (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      8.3.0 and 8.3.1 threw an error instead.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix GIN bug that could result in a <literal>too many LWLocks
      taken</literal> failure (Teodor)
     </para>

      Avoid possible crash when decompressing corrupted data
      (Zdenek Kotala)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix race conditions between delayed unlinks and <command>DROP
      DATABASE</> (Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the worst case this could result in deleting a newly created table
      in a new database that happened to get the same OID as the
      recently-dropped one; but of course that is an extremely
      low-probability scenario.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Repair two places where SIGTERM exit of a backend could leave corrupted
      state in shared memory (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      Neither case is very important if SIGTERM is used to shut down the
      whole database cluster together, but there was a problem if someone
      tried to SIGTERM individual backends.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible crash due to incorrect plan generated for an
      <literal><replaceable>x</> IN (SELECT <replaceable>y</>
      FROM ...)</literal> clause when <replaceable>x</> and <replaceable>y</>
      have different data types; and make sure the behavior is semantically
      correct when the conversion from <replaceable>y</>'s type to
      <replaceable>x</>'s type is lossy (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix oversight that prevented the planner from substituting known Param
      values as if they were constants (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This mistake partially disabled optimization of unnamed
      extended-Query statements in 8.3.0 and 8.3.1: in particular the
      LIKE-to-indexscan optimization would never be applied if the LIKE
      pattern was passed as a parameter, and constraint exclusion
      depending on a parameter value didn't work either.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix planner failure when an indexable <function>MIN</> or
      <function>MAX</> aggregate is used with <literal>DISTINCT</> or
      <literal>ORDER BY</> (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix planner to ensure it never uses a <quote>physical tlist</> for a
      plan node that is feeding a Sort node (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This led to the sort having to push around more data than it really
      needed to, since unused column values were included in the sorted
      data.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Avoid unnecessary copying of query strings (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This fixes a performance problem introduced in 8.3.0 when a very large
      number of commands are submitted as a single query string.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Make <function>TransactionIdIsCurrentTransactionId()</> use binary
      search instead of linear search when checking child-transaction XIDs
      (Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      This fixes some cases in which 8.3.0 was significantly
      slower than earlier releases.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
      Cyrillic <quote>Yo</> characters (<literal>e</> and <literal>E</> with
      two dots) (Sergey Burladyan)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix several datatype input functions, notably <function>array_in()</>,
      that were allowing unused bytes in their results to contain
      uninitialized, unpredictable values (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This could lead to failures in which two apparently identical literal
      values were not seen as equal, resulting in the parser complaining
      about unmatched <literal>ORDER BY</> and <literal>DISTINCT</>
      expressions.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
      (<literal>substring(<replaceable>string</> from
      <replaceable>pattern</>)</literal>) (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
      the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
      subexpression hasn't got a match.  An example is
      <literal>substring('foo' from 'foo(bar)?')</>.
      This should return NULL, since <literal>(bar)</> isn't matched, but
      it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match instead (ie,
      <literal>foo</>).

   <title>Migration to Version 8.3.1</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X.
    However, you might need to <command>REINDEX</> indexes on textual
    columns after updating, if you are affected by the Windows locale
    issue described below.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix character string comparison for Windows locales that consider
      different character combinations as equal (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8
      database encoding.  The same fix was made for all other cases
      over two years ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code
      path that was not updated.  If you are using a locale that
      considers some non-identical strings as equal, you may need to
      <command>REINDEX</> to fix existing indexes on textual columns.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Repair corner-case bugs in <command>VACUUM FULL</> (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      A potential deadlock between concurrent <command>VACUUM FULL</>
      operations on different system catalogs was introduced in 8.2.
      This has now been corrected.  8.3 made this worse because the
      deadlock could occur within a critical code section, making it
      a PANIC rather than just ERROR condition.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, a <command>VACUUM FULL</> that failed partway through
      vacuuming a system catalog could result in cache corruption in
      concurrent database sessions.
     </para>

     <para>
      Another <command>VACUUM FULL</> bug introduced in 8.3 could
      result in a crash or out-of-memory report when dealing with
      pages containing no live tuples.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix misbehavior of foreign key checks involving <type>character</>
      or <type>bit</> columns (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the referencing column were of a different but compatible type
      (for instance <type>varchar</>), the constraint was enforced incorrectly.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Avoid needless deadlock failures in no-op foreign-key checks (Stephan
      Szabo, Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible core dump when re-planning a prepared query (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug affected only protocol-level prepare operations, not
      SQL <command>PREPARE</>, and so tended to be seen only with
      JDBC, DBI, and other client-side drivers that use prepared
      statements heavily.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix possible failure when re-planning a query that calls an SPI-using
      function (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix failure in row-wise comparisons involving columns of different
      datatypes (Tom)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix longstanding <command>LISTEN</>/<command>NOTIFY</>
      race condition (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      In rare cases a session that had just executed a
      <command>LISTEN</> might not get a notification, even though
      one would be expected because the concurrent transaction executing
      <command>NOTIFY</> was observed to commit later.
     </para>

     <para>
      A side effect of the fix is that a transaction that has executed
      a not-yet-committed <command>LISTEN</> command will not see any
      row in <structname>pg_listener</> for the <command>LISTEN</>,
      should it choose to look; formerly it would have.  This behavior
      was never documented one way or the other, but it is possible that
      some applications depend on the old behavior.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disallow <command>LISTEN</> and <command>UNLISTEN</> within a
      prepared transaction (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various unpleasant
      consequences, notably that the originating backend could not exit
      as long as an <command>UNLISTEN</> remained uncommitted.
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <para>
      Disallow dropping a temporary table within a
      prepared transaction (Heikki)
     </para>

     <para>
      This was correctly disallowed by 8.1, but the check was inadvertently
      broken in 8.2 and 8.3.
     </para>

      Fix incorrect behavior of <literal>LIKE</> with non-ASCII characters

     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Disable <function>xmlvalidate</> (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This function should have been removed before 8.3 release, but
      was inadvertently left in the source code.  It poses a small
      security risk since unprivileged users could use it to read the
      first few characters of any file accessible to the server.

      escape sequences (Tom)
     </para>

     <para>
      This is necessary to avoid encoding problems when the database
      encoding is multi-byte.  This change could pose compatibility issues
      for applications that are expecting specific results from
      <function>encode</>.

       Non-character data types are no longer automatically cast to
       <type>TEXT</> (Peter, Tom)
      </para>

      <para>
       Previously, if a non-character value was supplied to an operator or
       function that requires <type>text</> input, it was automatically
       cast to <type>text</>, for most (though not all) built-in data types.
       This no longer happens: an explicit cast to <type>text</> is now
       required for all non-character-string types.  For example, these
       expressions formerly worked:

<programlisting>
substr(current_date, 1, 4)
23 LIKE '2%'
</programlisting>

       but will now draw <quote>function does not exist</> and <quote>operator
       does not exist</> errors respectively.  Use an explicit cast instead:

<programlisting>
substr(current_date::text, 1, 4)
23::text LIKE '2%'
</programlisting>

       (Of course, you can use the more verbose <literal>CAST()</> syntax too.)
       The reason for the change is that these automatic casts too often caused
       surprising behavior.  An example is that in previous releases, this
       expression was accepted but did not do what was expected:

<programlisting>
current_date &lt; 2017-11-17
</programlisting>

       This is actually comparing a date to an integer, which should be
       (and now is) rejected &mdash; but in the presence of automatic
       casts both sides were cast to <type>text</> and a textual comparison
       was done, because the <literal>text &lt; text</> operator was able
       to match the expression when no other <literal>&lt;</> operator could.
      </para>

      <para>
       Types <type>char(<replaceable>n</>)</type> and
       <type>varchar(<replaceable>n</>)</type> still cast to <type>text</>
       automatically.  Also, automatic casting to <type>text</> still works for
       inputs to the concatenation (<literal>||</>) operator, so long as least
       one input is a character-string type.

       Asynchronous commit delays writes to WAL during transaction commit
       (Simon)
      </para>

      <para>
       This feature dramatically increases performance for short data-modifying
       transactions.  The disadvantage is that because disk writes are delayed,
       if the database or operating system crashes before data is written to
       the disk, committed data will be lost.  This feature is useful for
       applications that can accept some data loss.  Unlike turning off
       <varname>fsync</varname>, using asynchronous commit does not put
       database consistency at risk; the worst case is that after a crash the
       last few reportedly-committed transactions might not be committed after
       all.
       This feature is enabled by turning off <varname>synchronous_commit</>
       (which can be done per-session or per-transaction, if some transactions
       are critical and others are not).
       <varname>wal_writer_delay</> can be adjusted to control the maximum
       delay before transactions actually reach disk.

      <para>
       Previously all modified buffers were forced to disk as quickly as
       possible during a
       checkpoint, causing an I/O spike that decreased server performance.
       This new approach spreads out disk writes during checkpoints,
       reducing peak I/O usage. (User-requested and shutdown checkpoints

       Non-persistent transaction IDs do not increment the global

       in-progress) and wrapping around to the beginning to finish.  This
       can affect the order of returned rows in a query that does not
       specify <literal>ORDER BY</>.  The <varname>synchronize_seqscans</>
       configuration parameter can be used to disable this if necessary.

       This parameter defines a list of tablespaces to be used.  This
