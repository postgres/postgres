  </para>

  <para>
   <acronym>JDBC</acronym> is a core <acronym>API</acronym> of Java 1.1 and later.
   It provides a standard set of
   interfaces to <acronym>SQL</acronym>-compliant databases.
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>Postgres</application> provides 
   a <firstterm>type 4</firstterm> <acronym>JDBC</acronym> Driver.
   Type 4 indicates that the driver
   is written in Pure Java, and communicates in the database's own network
   protocol. Because of this, the driver is platform independent. Once compiled,
   the driver can be used on any platform.
  </para>

   <title>Building the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> Interface</title>

   <sect2>
    <title>Compiling the Driver</title>

    <para>
     The driver's source is located in the <filename>src/interfaces/jdbc</filename>
     directory of the
     source tree. To compile simply change directory to that directory, and type:

     <programlisting>
% make
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Upon completion, you will find the archive <filename>postgresql.jar</filename>
     in the current
     directory. This is the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> driver.

     <note>
      <para>
       You must use <application>make</application>,
       not <application>javac</application>, 
       as the driver uses some dynamic
       loading techniques for performance reasons, 
       and <application>javac</application> cannot cope.
       The <filename>Makefile</filename> will generate the jar archive.
      </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Installing the Driver</title>

    <para>
     To use the driver, the jar archive postgresql.jar needs to be included in
     the <envar>CLASSPATH</envar>.
    </para>

    <sect3>
     <title>Example</title>

     <para>
      I have an application that uses the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> driver to access a large database
      containing astronomical objects. I have the application and the jdbc driver
      installed in the /usr/local/lib directory, and the java jdk installed in /usr/local/jdk1.1.6.
     </para>

     <para>
      To run the application, I would use:

      <programlisting>
export CLASSPATH = /usr/local/lib/finder.jar:/usr/local/lib/postgresql.jar:.
java uk.org.retep.finder.Main
      </programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      Loading the driver is covered later on in this chapter.
     </para>
    </sect3>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Preparing the Database for <acronym>JDBC</acronym></title>

   <para>
    Because Java can only use TCP/IP connections, the <application>Postgres</application> postmaster
    must be running with the -i flag.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also, the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file must be configured. It's located in the PGDATA
    directory. In a default installation, this file permits access only by Unix
    domain sockets. For the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> driver to connect to the same localhost, you need
    to add something like:

    <programlisting>
host         all         127.0.0.1     255.255.255.255   password
    </programlisting>

    Here access to all databases are possible from the local machine 
    with <acronym>JDBC</acronym>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <acronym>JDBC</acronym> Driver supports trust, ident, 
    password and crypt authentication methods.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Using the Driver</title>

   <para>
    This section is not intended as a complete guide to 
    <acronym>JDBC</acronym> programming, but
    should help to get you started. For more information refer to the standard
    <acronym>JDBC</acronym> <acronym>API</acronym> documentation.
    Also, take a look at the examples included with the source. The basic
    example is used here.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Importing <acronym>JDBC</acronym></title>

   <para>
    Any source that uses <acronym>JDBC</acronym>
    needs to import the java.sql package, using:

    <programlisting>
import java.sql.*;
    </programlisting>

    <important>
     <para>
      Do not import the postgresql package. If you do, your source will not
      compile, as javac will get confused.
     </para>
    </important>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Loading the Driver</title>

   <para>
    Before you can connect to a database, you need to load the driver. There
    are two methods available, and it depends on your code to the best one to use.
   </para>

   <para>
    In the first method, your code implicitly loads the driver using the
    <function>Class.forName()</function> method.
    For <application>Postgres</application>, you would use:

    <programlisting>
Class.forName("postgresql.Driver");
    </programlisting>

    This will load the driver, and while loading, the driver will automatically
    register itself with <acronym>JDBC</acronym>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note: The <function>forName()</function> method
    can throw a <literal>ClassNotFoundException</literal>, so you will
    need to catch it if the driver is not available.
   </para>

   <para>
    This is the most common method to use, but restricts your code to use just
    <application>Postgres</application>. 
    If your code may access another database in the future, and you
    don't use our extensions, then the second method is advisable.
   </para>

   <para>
    The second method passes the driver as a parameter to the JVM as it starts,
    using the -D argument. Example:

    <programlisting>
% java -Djdbc.drivers=postgresql.Driver example.ImageViewer
    </programlisting>

    In this example, the JVM will attempt to load the driver as part of it's
    initialisation. Once done, the ImageViewer is started.
   </para>

   <para>
    Now, this method is the better one to use because it allows your code to
    be used with other databases, without recompiling the code. The only thing
    that would also change is the URL, which is covered next.
   </para>

   <para>
    One last thing. When your code then tries to open a Connection, and you get
    a <literal>No driver available</literal> SQLException being thrown,
    this is probably
    caused by the driver not being in the classpath, or the value in the parameter
    not being correct.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Connecting to the Database</title>

   <para>
    With <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, a database is represented by a URL 
    (Uniform Resource Locator).
    With <application>Postgres</application>, this takes one of the following
    forms:

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       jdbc:postgresql:<replaceable class="parameter">database</replaceable>
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       jdbc:postgresql://<replaceable class="parameter">host</replaceable>/<replaceable class="parameter">database</replaceable>
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       jdbc:postgresql://<replaceable class="parameter">host</replaceable><replaceable class="parameter">port</replaceable>/<replaceable class="parameter">database</replaceable>
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    where:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       <replaceable class="parameter">host</replaceable>
      </term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The hostname of the server. Defaults to "localhost".
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       <replaceable class="parameter">port</replaceable>
      </term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The port number the server is listening on. Defaults to the Postgres
	standard port number (5432).
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       <replaceable class="parameter">database</replaceable>
      </term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	The database name.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    To connect, you need to get a Connection instance from 
    <acronym>JDBC</acronym>. To do this,
    you would use the DriverManager.getConnection() method:

    <programlisting>
Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,pwd);
    </programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Issuing a Query and Processing the Result</title>

   <para>
    Any time you want to issue SQL statements to the database, you require a
    Statement instance. Once you have a Statement, you can use the executeQuery()
    method to issue a query. This will return a ResultSet instance, which contains
    the entire result.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Using the Statement Interface</title>

    <para>
     The following must be considered when using the Statement interface:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	You can use a Statement instance as many times as you want. You could
	create one as soon as you open the connection, and use it for the connections
	lifetime. You have to remember that only one ResultSet can exist per Statement.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	If you need to perform a query while processing a ResultSet, you can
	simply create and use another Statement.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	If you are using Threads, and several are using the database, you must
	use a separate Statement for each thread. Refer to the sections covering
	Threads and Servlets later in this document if you are thinking of using them,
	as it covers some important points.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Using the ResultSet Interface</title>

    <para>
     The following must be considered when using the ResultSet interface:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Before reading any values, you must call <function>next()</function>. This returns true if
	there is a result, but more importantly, it prepares the row for processing.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Under the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> spec, you should access a
	field only once. It's safest to stick to this rule, although
	at the current time, the <application>Postgres</application> driver
	will allow you to access a field as many times as you want.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	You must close a ResultSet by calling
	<function>close()</function> once you have finished with it.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Once you request another query with the Statement used to create a
	ResultSet, the currently open instance is closed.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     An example is as follows:

     <programlisting>
Statement st = db.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select * from mytable");
while(rs.next()) {
    System.out.print("Column 1 returned ");
    System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}
rs.close();
st.close();
     </programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Performing Updates</title>

   <para>
    To perform an update (or any other SQL statement that does not return a
    result), you simply use the <function>executeUpdate()</function> method:

    <programlisting>
st.executeUpdate("create table basic (a int2, b int2)");
    </programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Closing the Connection</title>

   <para>
    To close the database connection, simply call the close() method to the Connection:

    <programlisting>
db.close();
    </programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title>Using Large Objects</title>

   <para>
    In <application>Postgres</application>, 
    large objects (also known as <firstterm>blobs</firstterm>) are used to hold data in
    the database that cannot be stored in a normal SQL table. They are stored as a
    Table/Index pair, and are referred to from your own tables by an OID value.
   </para>

   <para>
    <important>
     <para>
      For <productname>Postgres</productname>, you must access large
      objects within an SQL transaction. Although this has always been 
      true in principle, it was not strictly enforced until the
      release of v6.5. You would open a transaction by using the
      <function>setAutoCommit()</function> method with an input
      parameter of <literal>false</literal>:

      <programlisting>
Connection mycon;
...
mycon.setAutoCommit(false);
... now use Large Objects
      </programlisting>
     </para>
    </important>
   </para>

   <para>
    Now, there are two methods of using Large Objects. The first is the
    standard <acronym>JDBC</acronym> way, and is documented here. The
    other, uses our own extension
    to the api, which presents the libpq large object
    <acronym>API</acronym> to Java, providing even
    better access to large objects than the standard. Internally, the driver uses
    the extension to provide large object support.
   </para>

   <para>
    In <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, the standard way to access them is using the getBinaryStream()
    method in ResultSet, and setBinaryStream() method in PreparedStatement. These
    methods make the large object appear as a Java stream, allowing you to use the
    java.io package, and others, to manipulate the object.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example, suppose
    you have a table containing the file name of an image, and a large object
    containing that image:

    <programlisting>
create table images (imgname name,imgoid oid);
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    To insert an image, you would use:

    <programlisting>
File file = new File("myimage.gif");
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("insert into images values (?,?)");
ps.setString(1,file.getName());
ps.setBinaryStream(2,fis,file.length());
ps.executeUpdate();
ps.close();
fis.close();
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Now in this example, setBinaryStream transfers a set number of bytes from a
    stream into a large object, and stores the OID into the field holding a
    reference to it.
   </para>

   <para>
    Retrieving an image is even easier (I'm using PreparedStatement here, but
    Statement can equally be used):

    <programlisting>
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("select oid from images where name=?");
ps.setString(1,"myimage.gif");
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
if(rs!=null) {
    while(rs.next()) {
        InputStream is = rs.getBinaryInputStream(1);
        // use the stream in some way here
        is.close();
    }
    rs.close();
}
ps.close();
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Now here you can see where the Large Object is retrieved as an InputStream.
    You'll also notice that we close the stream before processing the next row in
    the result. This is part of the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> Specification, which states that any
    InputStream returned is closed when ResultSet.next() or ResultSet.close() is called.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
   <title><application>Postgres</application> Extensions to the
    <acronym>JDBC</acronym> <acronym>API</acronym></title>

   <para>
    <application>Postgres</application> is an extensible database system. 
    You can add your own functions
    to the backend, which can then be called from queries, or even add your own
    data types.
   </para>

   <para>
    Now, as these are facilities unique to us, we support them from Java, with
    a set of extension <acronym>API</acronym>'s. Some features within 
    the core of the standard driver
    actually use these extensions to implement Large Objects, etc.

<programlisting>
Accessing the extensions

To access some of the extensions, you need to use some extra methods 
in the postgresql.Connection class. In this case, you would need to 
case the return value of Driver.getConnection().

For example:

    Connection db = Driver.getConnection(url,user,pass);

    // later on
    Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)db).getFastpathAPI();

Class postgresql.Connection
                                
java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.Connection

   public class Connection extends Object implements Connection

These are the extra methods used to gain access to our extensions. I 
have not listed the methods defined by java.sql.Connection.

 public Fastpath getFastpathAPI() throws SQLException

          This returns the Fastpath <acronym>API</acronym> for the current connection.

          NOTE: This is not part of <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, but allows access to 
functions on the postgresql backend itself.

          It is primarily used by the LargeObject <acronym>API</acronym>

          The best way to use this is as follows:

 import postgresql.fastpath.*;
 ...
 Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getFastpathAPI();

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

        Returns:
                Fastpath object allowing access to functions on the 
postgresql backend.

        Throws: SQLException
                by Fastpath when initialising for first time
          
 public LargeObjectManager getLargeObjectAPI() throws SQLException

          This returns the LargeObject <acronym>API</acronym> for the current connection.

          NOTE: This is not part of <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, but allows access to 
functions on the postgresql backend itself.
   
          The best way to use this is as follows:

 import postgresql.largeobject.*;
 ...
 LargeObjectManager lo = 
((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getLargeObjectAPI();

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

        Returns:
                LargeObject object that implements the <acronym>API</acronym>

        Throws: SQLException
                by LargeObject when initialising for first time

 public void addDataType(String type,
                         String name)

          This allows client code to add a handler for one of 
postgresql's more unique data types. Normally, a data type not known 
by the driver is returned by ResultSet.getObject() as a PGobject 
instance.

This method allows you to write a class that extends PGobject, and 
tell the driver the type name, and class name to use.

The down side to this, is that you must call this method each time a 
connection is made.

          NOTE: This is not part of <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, but an extension.

          The best way to use this is as follows:

 ...
 ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).addDataType("mytype","my.class.name"-
);
 ...

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

          The handling class must extend postgresql.util.PGobject

        See Also:
                PGobject

Fastpath

Fastpath is an <acronym>API</acronym> that exists within the libpq C interface, and 
allows a client machine to execute a function on the database backend. 
Most client code will not need to use this method, but it's provided 
because the Large Object <acronym>API</acronym> uses it.

To use, you need to import the postgresql.fastpath package, using the 
line:
     import postgresql.fastpath.*;

Then, in your code, you need to get a FastPath object:
     Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)conn).getFastpathAPI();

This will return an instance associated with the database connection 
that you can use to issue commands. The casing of Connection to 
postgresql.Connection is required, as the getFastpathAPI() is one of 
our own methods, not <acronym>JDBC</acronym>'s.

Once you have a Fastpath instance, you can use the fastpath() methods 
to execute a backend function.

Class postgresql.fastpath.Fastpath

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.fastpath.Fastpath

   public class Fastpath

   extends Object

   This class implements the Fastpath api.

   This is a means of executing functions imbeded in the postgresql 
backend from within a java application.

   It is based around the file src/interfaces/libpq/fe-exec.c

   See Also:
          FastpathFastpathArg, LargeObject

Methods

 public Object fastpath(int fnid,
                        boolean resulttype,
                        FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          Send a function call to the PostgreSQL backend
          
        Parameters:
                fnid - Function id
                resulttype - True if the result is an integer, false 
for
                other results
                args - FastpathArguments to pass to fastpath

        Returns:
                null if no data, Integer if an integer result, or 
byte[]
                otherwise
         
        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.

 public Object fastpath(String name,
                        boolean resulttype,
                        FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          Send a function call to the PostgreSQL backend by name. 

Note:
          the mapping for the procedure name to function id needs to 
exist, usually to an earlier call to addfunction(). This is the 
prefered method to call, as function id's can/may change between 
versions of the backend. For an example of how this works, refer to 
postgresql.LargeObject

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                resulttype - True if the result is an integer, false 
for
                other results
                args - FastpathArguments to pass to fastpath

        Returns:
                null if no data, Integer if an integer result, or 
byte[]
                otherwise

        Throws: SQLException
                if name is unknown or if a database-access error 
occurs.

        See Also:
                LargeObject
          
 public int getInteger(String name,
                       FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          This convenience method assumes that the return value is an 
Integer

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                args - Function arguments

        Returns:
                integer result

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs or no result

 public byte[] getData(String name,
                       FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          This convenience method assumes that the return value is 
binary data

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                args - Function arguments

        Returns:
                byte[] array containing result

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs or no result

 public void addFunction(String name,
                         int fnid)

          This adds a function to our lookup table.

          User code should use the addFunctions method, which is based 
upon a query, rather than hard coding the oid. The oid for a function 
is not guaranteed to remain static, even on different servers of the 
same version.

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                fnid - Function id

 public void addFunctions(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException
                       
          This takes a ResultSet containing two columns. Column 1 
contains the function name, Column 2 the oid.

          It reads the entire ResultSet, loading the values into the 
function table.

          REMEMBER to close() the resultset after calling this!!

          Implementation note about function name lookups:
          
          PostgreSQL stores the function id's and their corresponding 
names in the pg_proc table. To speed things up locally, instead of 
querying each function from that table when required, a Hashtable is 
used. Also, only the function's required are entered into this table, 
keeping connection times as fast as possible.

          The postgresql.LargeObject class performs a query upon it's 
startup, and passes the returned ResultSet to the addFunctions() 
method here.
       
          Once this has been done, the LargeObject api refers to the 
functions by name.
          
          Dont think that manually converting them to the oid's will 
work. Ok, they will for now, but they can change during development 
(there was some discussion about this for V7.0), so this is 
implemented to prevent any unwarranted headaches in the future.

        Parameters:
                rs - ResultSet

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.

                LargeObjectManager

 public int getID(String name) throws SQLException
          
          This returns the function id associated by its name
          
          If addFunction() or addFunctions() have not been called for 
this name, then an SQLException is thrown.

        Parameters:
                name - Function name to lookup

        Returns:
                Function ID for fastpath call

        Throws: SQLException
                is function is unknown.

Geometric Data Types

PostgreSQL has a set of datatypes that can store geometric features 
into a table. These range from single points, lines, and polygons.

We support these types in Java with the postgresql.geometric package.

It contains classes that extend the postgresql.util.PGobject class. 
Refer to that class for details on how to implement your own data type 
handlers.

Large Objects

Large objects are supported in the standard <acronym>JDBC</acronym> specification. 
However, that interface is limited, and the api provided by PostgreSQL 
allows for random access to the objects contents, as if it was a local 
file.

The postgresql.largeobject package profides to Java the libpq C 
interface's large object <acronym>API</acronym>. It consists of two classes, 
LargeObjectManager, which deals with creating, opening and deleting 
large obejects, and LargeObject which deals with an individual object.

Class postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject

public class LargeObject extends Object

This class implements the large object interface to postgresql.

   It provides the basic methods required to run the interface, plus a 
pair of methods that provide InputStream and OutputStream classes for 
this object.

   Normally, client code would use the getAsciiStream, 
getBinaryStream, or getUnicodeStream methods in ResultSet, or 
setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, or setUnicodeStream methods in 
PreparedStatement to access Large Objects.

   However, sometimes lower level access to Large Objects are 
required, that are not supported by the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> specification.

   Refer to postgresql.largeobject.LargeObjectManager on how to gain 
access to a Large Object, or how to create one.

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.

 public int size() throws SQLException

          This method is inefficient, as the only way to find out the 
size of the object is to seek to the end, record the current position, 
then return to the original position.

          A better method will be found in the future.

        Returns:
                the size of the large object

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.

Class postgresql.largeobject.LargeObjectManager
                                
java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.largeobject.LargeObjectManager

public class LargeObjectManager extends Object

This class implements the large object interface to postgresql.
        
   It provides methods that allow client code to create, open and 
delete large objects from the database. When opening an object, an 
instance of postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject is returned, and its 
methods then allow access to the object.

This class can only be created by postgresql.Connection

To get access to this class, use the following segment of code:

 import postgresql.largeobject.*;
 Connection  conn;
 LargeObjectManager lobj;
 ... code that opens a connection ...
 lobj = ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getLargeObjectAPI();

Normally, client code would use the getAsciiStream, getBinaryStream, 
or getUnicodeStream methods in ResultSet, or setAsciiStream, 
setBinaryStream, or setUnicodeStream methods in PreparedStatement to 
access Large Objects.

   However, sometimes lower level access to Large Objects are 
required, that are not supported by the <acronym>JDBC</acronym> specification.

   Refer to postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject on how to manipulate 
the contents of a Large Object.

Object Serialisation
PostgreSQL is not a normal SQL Database. It is far more extensible 
than most other databases, and does support Object Oriented features 
that are unique to it. 

One of the consequences of this, is that you can have one table refer 
to a row in another table. For example:

test=> create table users (username name,fullname text);
CREATE
test=> create table server (servername name,adminuser users);
CREATE
test=> insert into users values ('peter','Peter Mount');
INSERT 2610132 1
test=> insert into server values ('maidast',2610132::users);
INSERT 2610133 1
test=> select * from users;
username|fullname      
--------+--------------
peter   |Peter Mount   
(1 row)

test=> select * from server;
servername|adminuser
----------+---------
maidast   |  2610132
(1 row)

Ok, the above example shows that we can use a table name as a field, 
and the row's oid value is stored in that field.

What does this have to do with Java?

In Java, you can store an object to a Stream as long as it's class 
implements the java.io.Serializable interface. This process, known as 
Object Serialization, can be used to store complex objects into the 
database.

Now, under <acronym>JDBC</acronym>, you would have to use a LargeObject to store them. 
However, you cannot perform queries on those objects.

What the postgresql.util.Serialize class does, is provide a means of 
storing an object as a table, and to retrieve that object from a 
table. In most cases, you would not need to access this class direct, 
but you would use the PreparedStatement.setObject() and 
ResultSet.getObject() methods. Those methods will check the objects 
class name against the table's in the database. If a match is found, 
it assumes that the object is a Serialized object, and retrieves it 
from that table. As it does so, if the object contains other 
serialized objects, then it recurses down the tree.

Sound's complicated? In fact, it's simpler than what I wrote - it's 
just difficult to explain.

The only time you would access this class, is to use the create() 
methods. These are not used by the driver, but issue one or more 
"create table" statements to the database, based on a Java Object or 
Class that you want to serialize.

Oh, one last thing. If your object contains a line like:

     public int oid;

then, when the object is retrieved from the table, it is set to the 
oid within the table. Then, if the object is modified, and re-
serialized, the existing entry is updated.

If the oid variable is not present, then when the object is 
serialized, it is always inserted into the table, and any existing 
entry in the table is preserved.

Setting oid to 0 before serialization, will also cause the object to 
be inserted. This enables an object to be duplicated in the database.

Class postgresql.util.Serialize

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.Serialize

   public class Serialize extends Object

   This class uses PostgreSQL's object oriented features to store Java 
Objects. It does this by mapping a Java Class name to a table in the 
database. Each entry in this new table then represents a Serialized 
instance of this class. As each entry has an OID (Object IDentifier), 
this OID can be included in another table. This is too complex to show 
here, and will be documented in the main documents in more detail.

Constructors

 public Serialize(Connection c,
                  String type) throws SQLException

          This creates an instance that can be used to serialize 
ordeserialize a Java object from a PostgreSQL table.

Methods

 public Object fetch(int oid) throws SQLException

          This fetches an object from a table, given it's OID

        Parameters:
                oid - The oid of the object

        Returns:
                Object relating to oid

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public int store(Object o) throws SQLException

          This stores an object into a table, returning it's OID.

          If the object has an int called OID, and it is > 0, then 
that value is used for the OID, and the table will be updated. If the 
value of OID is 0, then a new row will be created, and the value of 
OID will be set in the object. This enables an object's value in the 
database to be updateable. If the object has no int called OID, then 
the object is stored. However if the object is later retrieved, 
amended and stored again, it's new state will be appended to the 
table, and will not overwrite the old entries.

        Parameters:
                o - Object to store (must implement Serializable)

        Returns:
                oid of stored object

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
 
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Object o) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Object to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

                   Returns:
                Object relating to oid

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public int store(Object o) throws SQLException

          This stores an object into a table, returning it's OID.

          If the object has an int called OID, and it is > 0, then 
that value is used for the OID, and the table will be updated. If the 
value of OID is 0, then a new row will be created, and the value of 
OID will be set in the object. This enables an object's value in the 
database to be updateable. If the object has no int called OID, then 
the object is stored. However if the object is later retrieved, 
amended and stored again, it's new state will be appended to the 
table, and will not overwrite the old entries.

        Parameters:
                o - Object to store (must implement Serializable)

        Returns:
                oid of stored object

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
 
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Object o) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Object to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
                
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Class c) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Class to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public static String toPostgreSQL(String name) throws SQLException
          
          This converts a Java Class name to a postgresql table, by
          replacing . with _

          Because of this, a Class name may not have _ in the name.

          Another limitation, is that the entire class name (including
          packages) cannot be longer than 31 characters (a limit 
forced by PostgreSQL).

     <acronym>JDBC</acronym> 
Standard.
    A call to postgresql.Connection permits a class that extends this 
class to be associated with a named type. This is how the 
postgresql.geometric package operates.
    ResultSet.getObject() will return this class for any type that is 
not recognised on having it's own handler. Because of this, any 
postgresql data type is supported.

Constructors

 public PGobject()

          This is called by postgresql.Connection.getObject() to 
create the object.

Methods

 public final void setType(String type)

          This method sets the type of this object.

          It should not be extended by subclasses, hence its final

        Parameters:
                type - a string describing the type of the object

 public void setValue(String value) throws SQLException

          This method sets the value of this object. It must be 
overidden.

        Parameters:
                value - a string representation of the value of the
                object

        Throws: SQLException
                thrown if value is invalid for this type
    
 public final String getType()

          As this cannot change during the life of the object, it's 
final.

        Returns:
                the type name of this object

 public String getValue()

          This must be overidden, to return the value of the object, 
in the form required by postgresql.

        Returns:
                the value of this object

 public boolean equals(Object obj)

          This must be overidden to allow comparisons of objects

        Parameters:
                obj - Object to compare with

        Returns:
                true if the two boxes are identical

        Overrides:
                equals in class Object

 public Object clone()

          This must be overidden to allow the object to be cloned

        Overrides:
                clone in class Object

 public String toString()

          This is defined here, so user code need not overide it.
          
        Returns:
                the value of this object, in the syntax expected by 
postgresql

        Overrides:
                toString in class Object

Class postgresql.util.PGtokenizer

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.PGtokenizer

   public class PGtokenizer extends Object

   This class is used to tokenize the text output of postgres.

   We could have used StringTokenizer to do this, however, we needed 
to handle nesting of '(' ')' '[' ']' '<' and '>' as these are used by 
the geometric data types.

   It's mainly used by the geometric classes, but is useful in parsing 
any output from custom data types output from postgresql.

Constructors

 public PGtokenizer(String string,
                    char delim)

          Create a tokeniser.

        Parameters:
                string - containing tokens
                delim - single character to split the tokens

Methods
        
 public int tokenize(String string,
                     char delim)

          This resets this tokenizer with a new string and/or 
delimiter.

        Parameters:
                string - containing tokens
                delim - single character to split the tokens

 public int getSize()

        Returns:
                the number of tokens available

 public String getToken(int n)

        Parameters:
                n - Token number ( 0 ... getSize()-1 )

        Returns:
                The token value

 public PGtokenizer tokenizeToken(int n,
                                  char delim)

          This returns a new tokenizer based on one of our tokens. The 
geometric datatypes use this to process nested tokens (usually 
PGpoint).

        Parameters:
                n - Token number ( 0 ... getSize()-1 )
                delim - The delimiter to use

        Returns:
                A new instance of PGtokenizer based on the token

Class postgresql.util.Serialize

This was documented earlier under Object Serialisation.

Class postgresql.util.UnixCrypt
              
java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.UnixCrypt

   public class UnixCrypt extends Object

   This class provides us with the ability to encrypt passwords when 
sent over the network stream

   Contains static methods to encrypt and compare passwords with Unix 
encrypted passwords.

   See John Dumas's Java Crypt page for the original source.

   http://www.zeh.com/local/jfd/crypt.html

Methods

 public static final String crypt(String salt,
                                  String original)

          Encrypt a password given the cleartext password and a 
"salt".
   
        Parameters:
                salt - A two-character string representing the salt 
used
                to iterate the encryption engine in lots of different
                ways. If you are generating a new encryption then this
                value should be randomised.
                original - The password to be encrypted.

        Returns:
                A string consisting of the 2-character salt followed 
by
                the encrypted password.
              
 public static final String crypt(String original)

          Encrypt a password given the cleartext password. This method 
generates a random salt using the 'java.util.Random' class.

        Parameters:
                original - The password to be encrypted.
   
        Returns: 
                A string consisting of the 2-character salt followed 
by
                the encrypted password.
               
 public static final boolean matches(String encryptedPassword,
                                     String enteredPassword)
                 
          Check that enteredPassword encrypts to encryptedPassword.
               
        Parameters:
                encryptedPassword - The encryptedPassword. The first 
two characters are assumed to be the salt. This string would be the 
same as one found in a Unix /etc/passwd file.
                enteredPassword - The password as entered by the user 
(or otherwise aquired).

        Returns:
                true if the password should be considered correct.

Using the driver in a multi Threaded or Servlet environment

A problem with many <acronym>JDBC</acronym> drivers, is that only one thread can use a 
Connection at any one time - otherwise a thread could send a query 
while another one is receiving results, and this would be a bad thing 
for the database engine.

PostgreSQL 6.4, brings thread safety to the entire driver. Standard 
<acronym>JDBC</acronym> was thread safe in 6.3.x, but the Fastpath
     <acronym>API</acronym> wasn't.

So, if your application uses multiple threads (which most decent ones 
would), then you don't have to worry about complex schemes to ensure 
only one uses the database at any time.

If a thread attempts to use the connection while another is using it, 
it will wait until the other thread has finished it's current 
operation.

If it's a standard SQL statement, then the operation is sending the 
statement, and retrieving any ResultSet (in full).

If it's a Fastpath call (ie: reading a block from a LargeObject), then 
it's the time to send, and retrieve that block.

This is fine for applications & applets, but can cause a performance 
problem with servlets.

With servlets, you can have a heavy load on the connection. If you 
have several threads performing queries, then each one will pause, 
which may not be what you are after.

To solve this, you would be advised to create a pool of Connections.

When ever a thread needs to use the database, it asks a manager class 
for a Connection. It hands a free connection to the thread, and marks 
it as busy. If a free connection is not available, it opens one.

Once the thread has finished with it, it returns it to the manager, 
who can then either close it, or add it to the pool. The manager would 
also check that the connection is still alive, and remove it from the 
pool if it's dead.

So, with servlets, it's up to you to use either a single connection, 
or a pool. The plus side for a pool is that threads will not be hit by 
the bottle neck caused by a single network connection. The down side, 
is that it increases the load on the server, as a backend is created 
for each Connection.

It's up to you, and your applications requirements.
