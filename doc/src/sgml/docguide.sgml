 <title>Documentation</title>

 <para>
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has four primary documentation
  formats:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Plain text, for pre-installation information
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <acronym>HTML</acronym>, for on-line browsing and reference
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Postscript, for printing
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     man pages, for quick reference.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  Additionally, a number of plain-text README-type files can be found
  throughout the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> source tree,
  documenting various implementation issues.
 </para>

 <para>
  The documentation is organized into several <quote>books</quote>
  with varyingly confusing names:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <citetitle>Tutorial</citetitle>:  introduction for new users
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle>: documents the query language environment
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <citetitle>Administrator's Guide</citetitle>: installation and server maintenance
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <citetitle>Programmer's Guide</citetitle>: programming client
     applications and server extensions
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <citetitle>Developer's Guide</citetitle>: assorted information
     for developers of PostgreSQL proper
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  All five books are available as HTML and Postscript.  The
  <citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle> contains reference entries which
  are also shipped as man pages.
 </para>

 <para>
  <acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation and man pages are part of a
  standard distribution and are installed by default.  Postscript
  format documentation is available separately for download.
 </para>

 <sect1>
  <title>DocBook</title>
  <para>
   The documentation sources are written in
   <firstterm>DocBook</firstterm>, which is a markup language
   superficially similar to <acronym>HTML</acronym>.  Both of these
   languages are applications of the <firstterm>Standard Generalized
   Markup Language</firstterm>, <acronym>SGML</acronym>, which is
   essentially a language for describing other languages.  In what
   follows, the terms DocBook and SGML are both used, but technically
   they are not interchangeable.
  </para>

  <para>
  <productname>DocBook</productname> allows an author to specify the
   structure and content of a technical document without worrying
   about presentation details.  A document style defines how that
   content is rendered into one of several final forms.  DocBook is
   maintained by the <ulink
   url="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</ulink> group.  The <ulink
   url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook">official DocBook
   site</ulink> has good introductory and reference documentation and
   a complete O'Reilly book for your online reading pleasure.  The
   <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/docproj/docproj.html">FreeBSD
   Documentation Project</ulink> also uses DocBook and has some good
   information, including a number of style guidelines that might be
   worth considering.
  </para>
 </sect1>


 <sect1 id="doc-toolsets">
  <title>Toolsets</title>

  <para>
   The following tools are used to process the documentation.  Some
   may be optional, as noted.

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/">DocBook DTD</ulink></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This is the definition of DocBook itself.  We currently use
       version 3.1; you cannot use later or earlier versions.  Note
       that there is also an <acronym>XML</acronym> version of DocBook
       -- do not use that.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       These are required by DocBook but are distributed separately
       because they are maintained by ISO.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This is the base package of <acronym>SGML</acronym> processing.
       It contains an <acronym>SGML</acronym> parser, a
       <acronym>DSSSL</acronym> processor (that is, a program to
       convert <acronym>SGML</acronym> to other formats using
       <acronym>DSSSL</acronym> stylesheets), as well as a number of
       related tools.  <productname>Jade</productname> is now being
       maintained by the OpenJade group, no longer by James Clark.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       These contain the processing instructions for converting the
       DocBook sources to other formats, such as

    <varlistentry>
     <term>JadeTeX</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If you want to, you can also install
       <productname>JadeTeX</productname> to use
       <productname>TeX</productname> as a formatting backend for
       <productname>Jade</productname>.  This will generate printed
       output that is inferior to what you get from the
       <acronym>RTF</acronym> backend.  Tables are a particular
       problem area.  Also, there is no opportunity to manually polish
       the results.  Still, it works all right, especially for simpler
       documents that don't use tables, and as both
       <productname>JadeTeX</productname> and the style sheets are
       under continuous improvement, it will certainly get better over
       time.

  <para>
   We have documented experience with several installation methods for
   the various tools that are needed to process the documentation.
   These will be described below.  There may be some other packaged
   distributions for these tools. Please report package status to the
   docs mailing list and we will include that information here.

  <sect2>
   <title><productname>Linux</productname> <acronym>RPM</acronym> Installation</title>

   <para>
    Many vendors provide a complete RPM set for DocBook processing in
    their distribution, which is usually based on the <ulink
    url="http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/">docbook-tools</ulink>
    effort at Red Hat Software.  Look for an <quote>SGML</quote>
    option while installing, or the following packages:
    <filename>sgml-common</filename>, <filename>docbook</filename>,
    <filename>stylesheets</filename>, <filename>openjade</filename>
    (or <filename>jade</filename>).  Possibly
    <filename>sgml-tools</filename> will be needed as well.  If your
    distributor does not provide these then you should be able to make
    use of the packages from some large, reasonably compatible vendor.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>FreeBSD Installation</title>

   <para>
    The FreeBSD Documentation Project is itself a heavy user of
    DocBook, so it comes as no surprise that there is a full set of
    <quote>ports</quote> of the documentation tools available on
    FreeBSD.  The following ports need to be installed to build the
    documentation on FreeBSD.
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para><filename>textproc/sp</filename></para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para><filename>textproc/dsssl-docbook-modular</filename></para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    A number of things from <filename>/usr/ports/print</filename>
    (<filename>tex</filename>, <filename>jadetex</filename>) might
    also be of interest.
   </para>

   <para>
    It's possible that the ports do not update the main catalog file
    in <filename>/usr/local/share/sgml/catalog</filename>.  Be sure to
    have the following line in there:
<programlisting>
CATALOG "/usr/local/share/sgml/docbook/3.1/catalog"
</programlisting>
    If you do not want to edit the file you can also set the
    environment variable <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> to a
    colon-separated list of catalog files (such as the one above).
   </para>

   <para>
    More information about the FreeBSD documentation tools can be
    found in the <ulink

    Documentation Project's instructions</ulink>.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Debian Packages</title>

   <para>
    There is a full set of packages of the documentation tools
    available for <productname>Debian GNU/Linux</productname>.
    To install, simply use:
<programlisting>
apt-get install jade
apt-get install docbook
apt-get install docbook-stylesheets
</programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Manual Installation from Source</title>

   <para>
    The manual installation process of the DocBook tools is somewhat
    complex, so if you have pre-built packages available, use them.
    We describe here only a standard setup, with reasonabley standard
    installation paths, and no <quote>fancy</quote> features.  For
    details, you should study the documentation of the respective
    package, and read <acronym>SGML</acronym> introductory material.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Installing Jade</title>

    <para>
     The installation of OpenJade offers a GNU-style
     <literal>./configure; make; make install</literal> build process.
     Details can be found in the OpenJade source distribution. In a
     nutshell:
<synopsis>
./configure --enable-default-catalog=/usr/local/share/sgml/catalog
make
make install
</synopsis>
     Be sure to remember where you put the <quote>default
     catalog</quote>; you will need it below.  You can also leave it
     off, but then you will have to set the environment variable
     <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> to point to the file whenever
     you use <application>jade</application> later on.
    </para>

    <para>
     Additionally, you should install the files
     <filename>dsssl.dtd</filename>, <filename>fot.dtd</filename>,
     <filename>style-sheet.dtd</filename>, and
     <filename>catalog</filename> from the <filename>dsssl</filename>
     directory somewhere, perhaps into
     <filename>/usr/local/share/sgml/dsssl</filename>.  (Or just copy
     the entire directory.)

     <step>
      <para>
       Create a file

      <para>
       Optionally, you can edit the file
       <filename>docbook.cat</filename> and comment out or remove the

     To install the style sheets, simply unzip the distribution kit in

   <sect3>
    <title>Installing <productname>JadeTeX</productname></title>

    <para>
     To install and use <productname>JadeTeX</productname>, you will
     need a working installation of <productname>TeX</productname> and
     <productname>LaTeX2e</productname>, including the supported
     <productname>tools</productname> and
     <productname>graphics</productname> packages,
     <productname>Babel</productname>,
     <productname><acronym>AMS</acronym> fonts</productname> and
     <productname>AMS-LaTeX</productname>, the
     <productname><acronym>PSNFSS</acronym></productname> extension
     and companion kit of <quote>the 35 fonts</quote>, the
     <productname>dvips</productname> program for generating
     <productname>PostScript</productname>, the macro packages
     <productname>fancyhdr</productname>,
     <productname>hyperref</productname>,
     <productname>minitoc</productname>,
     <productname>url</productname> and
     <productname>ot2enc</productname>, and of course
     <productname>JadeTeX</productname> itself.  All of these can be
     found on your friendly neighborhood <ulink
     url="http://www.ctan.org"><acronym>CTAN</acronym></ulink> site.
    </para>

    <para>
     <productname>JadeTeX</productname> does not at the time of
     writing come with much of an installation guide, but there is a
     <filename>makefile</filename> that shows what is needed.  It
     also includes a directory <filename>cooked</filename>, wherein
     you'll find some of the macro packages it needs, but not all, and
     not complete -- at least last we looked.
    </para>

    <para>
     Before building the <filename>jadetex.fmt</filename> format file,
     you'll probably want to edit the <filename>jadetex.ltx</filename>
     file, to change the configuration of
     <productname>Babel</productname> to suit your locality.  The line
     to change looks something like
<programlisting>
\RequirePackage[german,french,english]{babel}[1997/01/23]
</programlisting>
     and you should obviously list only the languages you actually need,
     and have configured <productname>Babel</productname> for.
    </para>

    <para>
     It is quite likely that when you use
     <productname>JadeTeX</productname> with
     <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> documentation sources, that
     <productname>TeX</productname> will stop during the second run,
     and tell you that its capacity has been exceeded.  This is, as
     far as we can tell, because of the way
     <productname>JadeTeX</productname> generates cross referencing
     information.  <productname>TeX</productname> can, of course, be
     compiled with larger data structure sizes.  The details of this
     will vary according to your installation.
    </para>

 <sect1 id="doc-build">
  <title>Building The Documentation</title>

  <para>
   Before you can build the documentation you need to run the
   <filename>configure</filename> script as you would when building
   the programs themselves.  Check the output near the end of the run,
   it should look something like this:
<screen>
<computeroutput>
checking for onsgmls... onsgmls
checking for openjade... openjade
checking for DocBook V3.1... yes
checking for DocBook stylesheets... /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular
checking for sgmlspl... sgmlspl
</computeroutput>
</screen>
   If neither <filename>onsgmls</filename> nor
   <filename>nsgmls</filename> were found then you will not see the
   remaining 4 lines.  <filename>nsgmls</filename> is part of the Jade
   package.  If <quote>DocBook V3.1</quote> was not found then you did
   not install the DocBook DTD kit in a place where jade can find it,
   or you have not set up the catalog files correctly.  See the
   installation hints above.  The DocBook stylesheets are looked for
   in a number of relatively standard places, but if you have them
   some other place then you should set the environment variable
   <envar>DOCBOOKSTYLE</envar> to the location and rerun
   <filename>configure</filename> afterwards.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you have everything set up, change to the directory
   <filename>doc/src/sgml</filename> and run one of the following
   commands: (Remember to use GNU make.)
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>

    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   The other books can be built with analogous commands by replacing
   <literal>admin</literal> with one of <literal>developer</literal>,
   <literal>programmer</literal>, <literal>tutorial</literal>, or
   <literal>user</literal>.  Using <literal>postgres</literal> builds
   an integrated version of all 5 books, which is practical since the
   browser interface makes it easy to move around all of the
   documentation by just clicking.
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>HTML</title>

   <para>
    When building <acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation in
    <filename>doc/src/sgml</filename>, some of the resulting files
    will possibly (or quite certainly) have conflicting names between
    books.  Therefore the files are not in that directory in the
    regular distribution.  Instead, the files belonging to each book
    are stored in a tar archive that is unpacked at installation time.
    To create a set of <acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation packages
    use the commands
<programlisting>
cd doc/src
gmake tutorial.tar.gz
gmake user.tar.gz
gmake admin.tar.gz
gmake programmer.tar.gz
gmake postgres.tar.gz
gmake install
</programlisting>
    In the distribution, these archives live in the
    <filename>doc</filename> directory and are installed by default
    with <command>gmake install</command>.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="doc-manpages">
  <title>Manpages</title>

  <para>
   We use the <application>docbook2man</application> utility to
   convert <productname>DocBook</productname>
   <sgmltag>REFENTRY</sgmltag> pages to *roff output suitable for man
   pages.  The man pages are also distributed as a tar archive,
   similar to the <acronym>HTML</acronym> version.  To create the man page package, use the commands
<programlisting>
cd doc/src
gmake man
</programlisting>
   which will result in a tar file being generated in the
   <filename>doc/src</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   The man build leaves a lot of confusing output, and special care
   must be taken to produce quality results.  There is still room for
   improvement in this area.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="doc-hardcopy">
  <title>Hardcopy Generation</title>

  <para>
   The hardcopy Postscript documentation is generated by converting the
   <acronym>SGML</acronym> source code to <acronym>RTF</acronym>, then
   importing into <productname>ApplixWare-4.4.1</productname>. 
   After a little cleanup (see the following
   section) the output is "printed" to a postscript file.
  </para>

<!--
  <para>
   Some figures were redrawn to avoid having bitmap
   <acronym>GIF</acronym> files in the hardcopy documentation. One
   figure, of the system catalogs, was sufficiently complex that there
   was  not time to redraw it. It was converted to fit using the
   following commands:

   <programlisting>
% convert -monochrome -v -geometry 500x500'>' catalogs.ps catalogs.gif
% convert -v -crop 400x500 catalogs.gif catalogs-cropped.gif
   </programlisting>

    <para>
     <application>jade</application>, an integral part of the

     from the ApplixWare folks the symptom was diagnosed and a
     workaround is available.

      where the script is adding <literal>{\s0 Normal;}</literal> as
      the zero-th style in the document. According to ApplixWare, the

   <title>Plain Text Files</title>

   <para>
    Several files are distributed as plain text, for reading during
    the installation process. The <filename>INSTALL</filename> file
    corresponds to the chapter in the <citetitle>Administrator's
    Guide</citetitle>, with some minor changes to account for the
    different context.  To recreate the file, change to the directory
    <filename>doc/src/sgml</filename> and enter <userinput>gmake
    INSTALL</userinput>.  This will create a file
    <filename>INSTALL.html</filename> that can be saved as text with
    <productname>Netscape Navigator</productname> and put into the
    place of the existing file.  <productname>Netscape</productname>
    seems to offer the best quality for <acronym>HTML</acronym> to
    text conversions (over <application>lynx</application> and
    <application>w3m</application>).
   </para>

   <para>
    The file <filename>HISTORY</filename> can be created similarly,
    using the command <userinput>gmake HISTORY</userinput>.  The table
    of contents should be removed manually from the resulting text
    file.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since it does not change very often, the generation of the file
    <filename>src/test/regress/README</filename> is not fully
    automated.  After building the <acronym>HTML</acronym> version of
    the <citetitle>Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, convert the
    resulting files <filename>regress.htm</filename> and
    <filename>regress-platform.htm</filename> to text, using
    <productname>Netscape</productname>.  Then paste the text files
    together and edit them to taste (e.g., remove the navigation
    bars, remove the references to other chapters).

  <title>Documentation Authoring</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SGML</acronym> and <productname>DocBook</productname> do
    not suffer from an oversupply of open-source authoring tools. The
    most common toolset is the
    <productname>Emacs</productname>/<productname>XEmacs</productname>
    editor with appropriate editing mode.  On some systems
    (e.g., RedHat Linux) these tools are provided in a typical full
    installation.

   <sect2>
    <title>Emacs/PSGML</title>

    <para>
     <productname>PSGML</productname> is the most common and most
     powerful mode for editing <acronym>SGML</acronym> documents.
     When properly configured, it will allow you to use
     <application>Emacs</application> to insert tags and check markup
     consistancy.  You could use it for <acronym>HTML</acronym> as
     well.  Check the <ulink
     url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html">PSGML
     web site</ulink> for downloads, installation instructions, and
     detailed documentation.
    </para>

    <para>
     There is one important thing to note with
     <productname>PSGML</productname>: its author assumed that your
     main <acronym>SGML</acronym> <acronym>DTD</acronym> directory
     would be <filename>/usr/local/lib/sgml</filename>.  If, as in the
     examples in this chapter, you use
     <filename>/usr/local/share/sgml</filename>, you have to
     compensate for this, either by setting
     <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> environment variable, or you
     can customize your <productname>PSGML</productname> installation
     (its manual tells you how).
    </para>

    <para>
     Put the following in your <filename>~/.emacs</filename>
     environment file (adjusting the path names to be appropriate for
     your system):

<programlisting>

(setq sgml-omittag t)
(setq sgml-shorttag t)

(setq sgml-ecat-files nil)

(autoload 'sgml-mode "psgml" "Major mode to edit SGML files." t )
</programlisting>

     and in the same file add an entry for <acronym>SGML</acronym>
     into the (existing) definition for
     <varname>auto-mode-alist</varname>:
<programlisting>
(setq
  auto-mode-alist
  '(("\\.sgml$" . sgml-mode)
   ))
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Currently, each <acronym>SGML</acronym> source file has the
     following block at the end of the file:

<programlisting>
&lt;!-- Keep this comment at the end of the file
Local variables:

     This will set up a number of editing mode parameters even if you
     do not set up your <filename>~/.emacs</filename> file, but it is
     a bit unfortunate, since if you followed the installation
     instructions above, then the catalog path will not match your
     location.  Hence you might need to turn off local variables:
<programlisting>

    <para>
     The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution includes a
     parsed DTD definitions file <filename>reference.ced</filename>.
     You may find that when using PSGML, a comfortable way of working
     with these separate files of book parts is to insert a proper
     <literal>DOCTYPE</literal> declaration while you're editing them.
     If you are working on this source, for instance, it is an
     appendix chapter, so you would specify the document as an
     <quote>appendix</quote> instance of a DocBook document by making
     the first line look like this:

<programlisting>
&lt;!doctype appendix PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN"&gt;
</programlisting>

     This means that anything and everything that reads
     <acronym>SGML</acronym> will get it right, and I can verify the
     document with <command>nsgmls -s docguide.sgml</command>.  (But
     you need to take out that line before building the entire
     documentation set.)
