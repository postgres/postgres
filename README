PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================
  
This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces including some of the more
common listed below:

PHP - http://www.php.net
Python - http://www.initd.org/
Ruby - http://ruby.scripting.ca/postgres/

Other language bindings are available from a variety of contributing
parties.

PostgreSQL also has a great number of procedural languages available,
