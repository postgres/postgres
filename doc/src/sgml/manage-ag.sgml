 <title>Managing Databases</title>

 <indexterm zone="managing-databases"><primary>database</></>

 <para>
  Every instance of a running <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
  server manages one or more databases.  Databases are therefore the
  topmost hierarchical level for organizing <acronym>SQL</acronym>
  objects (<quote>database objects</quote>).  This chapter describes
  the properties of databases, and how to create, manage, and destroy
  them.
 </para>

  <title>Overview</title>

  <indexterm zone="manage-ag-overview">
   <primary>schema</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   A database is a named collection of <acronym>SQL</acronym> objects
   (<quote>database objects</quote>).  Generally, every database
   object (tables, functions, etc.) belongs to one and only one
   database.  (But there are a few system catalogs, for example
   <literal>pg_database</>, that belong to a whole cluster and
   are accessible from each database within the cluster.)  More
   accurately, a database is a collection of schemas and the schemas
   contain the tables, functions, etc.  So the full hierarchy is:
   server, database, schema, table (or some other kind of object,
   such as a function).
  </para>

  <para>
   When connecting to the database server, a client must specify in
   its connection request the name of the database it wants to connect
   to. It is not possible to access more than one database per
   connection. (But an application is not restricted in the number of
   connections it opens to the same or other databases.)  Databases are
   physically separated and access control is managed at the
   connection level.  If one <productname>PostgreSQL</> server
   instance is to house projects or users that should be separate and
   for the most part unaware of each other, it is therefore
   recommendable to put them into separate databases.  If the projects
   or users are interrelated and should be able to use each other's
   resources they should be put in the same database, but possibly
   into separate schemas.  Schemas are a purely logical structure and who can
   access what is managed by the privilege system.  More information about
   managing schemas is in <xref linkend="ddl-schemas">.
  </para>

  <para>
   Databases are created with the <command>CREATE DATABASE</> command
   (see <xref linkend="manage-ag-createdb">) and destroyed with the
   <command>DROP DATABASE</> command
   (see <xref linkend="manage-ag-dropdb">).
   To determine the set of existing databases, examine the
   <structname>pg_database</> system catalog, for example
<synopsis>
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
</synopsis>
   The <xref linkend="app-psql"> program's <literal>\l</> meta-command
   and <option>-l</> command-line option are also useful for listing the
   existing databases.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    The <acronym>SQL</> standard calls databases <quote>catalogs</>, but there
    is no difference in practice.
   </para>

 <sect1 id="manage-ag-createdb">
  <title>Creating a Database</title>

  <para>
   In order to create a database, the <productname>PostgreSQL</>
   server must be up and running (see <xref
   linkend="server-start">).
  </para>

  <para>
   Databases are created with the SQL command
   <xref linkend="sql-createdatabase" endterm="sql-createdatabase-title">:<indexterm><primary>CREATE
   DATABASE</></>
<synopsis>
CREATE DATABASE <replaceable>name</>;
</synopsis>
   where <replaceable>name</> follows the usual rules for
   <acronym>SQL</acronym> identifiers.  The current role automatically
   becomes the owner of the new database. It is the privilege of the
   owner of a database to remove it later on (which also removes all
   the objects in it, even if they have a different owner).
  </para>

  <para>
   The creation of databases is a restricted operation. See <xref
   linkend="role-attributes"> for how to grant permission.
  </para>

  <para>
   Since you need to be connected to the database server in order to
   execute the <command>CREATE DATABASE</command> command, the
   question remains how the <emphasis>first</> database at any given
   site can be created. The first database is always created by the
   <command>initdb</> command when the data storage area is
   initialized. (See <xref linkend="creating-cluster">.)  This
   database is called
   <literal>postgres</>.<indexterm><primary>postgres</></> So to
   create the first <quote>ordinary</> database you can connect to
   <literal>postgres</>.
  </para>

  <para>
   A second database,
   <literal>template1</literal>,<indexterm><primary>template1</></>
   is also created by
   <command>initdb</>.  Whenever a new database is created within the
   cluster, <literal>template1</literal> is essentially cloned.
   This means that any changes you make in <literal>template1</> are
   propagated to all subsequently created databases. Therefore it is
   unwise to use <literal>template1</> for real work, but when
   used judiciously this feature can be convenient.  More details
   appear in <xref linkend="manage-ag-templatedbs">.
  </para>

  <para>
   As a convenience, there is a program that you can
   execute from the shell to create new databases,
   <command>createdb</>.<indexterm><primary>createdb</></>

<synopsis>
createdb <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
</synopsis>

   <command>createdb</> does no magic. It connects to the <literal>postgres</>
   database and issues the <command>CREATE DATABASE</> command,
   exactly as described above.
   The <xref linkend="app-createdb"> reference page contains the invocation
   details. Note that <command>createdb</> without any arguments will create
   a database with the current user name, which may or may not be what
   you want.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    <xref linkend="client-authentication"> contains information about
    how to restrict who can connect to a given database.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   Sometimes you want to create a database for someone else.  That
   role should become the owner of the new database, so he can
   configure and manage it himself.  To achieve that, use one of the
   following commands:
<programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE <replaceable>dbname</> OWNER <replaceable>rolename</>;
</programlisting>
   from the SQL environment, or
<programlisting>
createdb -O <replaceable>rolename</> <replaceable>dbname</>
</programlisting>
   from the shell.
   You must be a superuser to be allowed to create a database for
   someone else (that is, for a role you are not a member of).
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="manage-ag-templatedbs">
  <title>Template Databases</title>

  <para>
   <command>CREATE DATABASE</> actually works by copying an existing
   database.  By default, it copies the standard system database named
   <literal>template1</>.<indexterm><primary>template1</></> Thus that
   database is the <quote>template</> from which new databases are
   made.  If you add objects to <literal>template1</>, these objects
   will be copied into subsequently created user databases.  This
   behavior allows site-local modifications to the standard set of
   objects in databases.  For example, if you install the procedural
   language <application>PL/pgSQL</> in <literal>template1</>, it will
   automatically be available in user databases without any extra
   action being taken when those databases are made.
  </para>

  <para>
   There is a second standard system database named
   <literal>template0</>.<indexterm><primary>template0</></> This
   database contains the same data as the initial contents of
   <literal>template1</>, that is, only the standard objects
   predefined by your version of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  <literal>template0</>
   should never be changed after <command>initdb</>.  By instructing
   <command>CREATE DATABASE</> to copy <literal>template0</> instead
   of <literal>template1</>, you can create a <quote>virgin</> user
   database that contains none of the site-local additions in
   <literal>template1</>.  This is particularly handy when restoring a
   <literal>pg_dump</> dump: the dump script should be restored in a
   virgin database to ensure that one recreates the correct contents
   of the dumped database, without any conflicts with additions that
   may now be present in <literal>template1</>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To create a database by copying <literal>template0</literal>, use
<programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE <replaceable>dbname</> TEMPLATE template0;
</programlisting>
   from the SQL environment, or
<programlisting>
createdb -T template0 <replaceable>dbname</>
</programlisting>
   from the shell.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is possible to create additional template databases, and indeed
   one may copy any database in a cluster by specifying its name
   as the template for <command>CREATE DATABASE</>.  It is important to
   understand, however, that this is not (yet) intended as
   a general-purpose <quote><command>COPY DATABASE</command></quote> facility.
   The principal limitation is that no other sessions can be connected to
   the source database while it is being copied.  <command>CREATE
   DATABASE</> will fail if any other connection exists when it starts;
   otherwise, new connections to the source database are locked out
   until <command>CREATE DATABASE</> completes.
  </para>

  <para>
   Two useful flags exist in <literal>pg_database</literal><indexterm><primary>pg_database</></> for each
   database: the columns <literal>datistemplate</literal> and
   <literal>datallowconn</literal>.  <literal>datistemplate</literal>
   may be set to indicate that a database is intended as a template for
   <command>CREATE DATABASE</>.  If this flag is set, the database may be
   cloned by 
   any user with <literal>CREATEDB</> privileges; if it is not set, only superusers
   and the owner of the database may clone it.
   If <literal>datallowconn</literal> is false, then no new connections
   to that database will be allowed (but existing sessions are not killed
   simply by setting the flag false).  The <literal>template0</literal>
   database is normally marked <literal>datallowconn = false</> to prevent modification of it.
   Both <literal>template0</literal> and <literal>template1</literal>
   should always be marked with <literal>datistemplate = true</>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    <literal>template1</> and <literal>template0</> do not have any special
    status beyond the fact that the name <literal>template1</> is the default
    source database name for <command>CREATE DATABASE</>.
    For example, one could drop <literal>template1</> and recreate it from
    <literal>template0</> without any ill effects.  This course of action
    might be advisable if one has carelessly added a bunch of junk in
    <literal>template1</>. (To delete <literal>template1</literal>,
    it must have <literal>datistemplate = false</>.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>postgres</> database is also created when a database
    cluster is initialized.  This database is meant as a default database for
    users and applications to connect to. It is simply a copy of
    <literal>template1</> and may be dropped and recreated if required.
   </para>
  </note>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="manage-ag-config">
  <title>Database Configuration</title>

  <para>
   Recall from <xref linkend="runtime-config"> that the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> server provides a large number of
   run-time configuration variables.  You can set database-specific
   default values for many of these settings.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, if for some reason you want to disable the
   <acronym>GEQO</acronym> optimizer for a given database, you'd
   ordinarily have to either disable it for all databases or make sure
   that every connecting client is careful to issue <literal>SET geqo
   TO off;</literal>.  To make this setting the default within a particular
   database, you can execute the command
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE mydb SET geqo TO off;
</programlisting>
   This will save the setting (but not set it immediately).  In
   subsequent connections to this database it will appear as though
   <literal>SET geqo TO off;</literal> had been executed just before the
   session started.
   Note that users can still alter this setting during their sessions; it
   will only be the default.  To undo any such setting, use
   <literal>ALTER DATABASE <replaceable>dbname</> RESET
   <replaceable>varname</>;</literal>.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="manage-ag-dropdb">
  <title>Destroying a Database</title>

  <para>
   Databases are destroyed with the command 
   <xref linkend="sql-dropdatabase" endterm="sql-dropdatabase-title">:<indexterm><primary>DROP DATABASE</></>
<synopsis>
DROP DATABASE <replaceable>name</>;
</synopsis>
   Only the owner of the database, or
   a superuser, can drop a database. Dropping a database removes all objects
   that were 
   contained within the database. The destruction of a database cannot
   be undone.
  </para>

  <para>
   You cannot execute the <command>DROP DATABASE</command> command
   while connected to the victim database. You can, however, be
   connected to any other database, including the <literal>template1</>
   database.
   <literal>template1</> would be the only option for dropping the last user database of a
   given cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
   For convenience, there is also a shell program to drop
   databases, <xref linkend="app-dropdb">:<indexterm><primary>dropdb</></>
<synopsis>
dropdb <replaceable class="parameter">dbname</replaceable>
</synopsis>
   (Unlike <command>createdb</>, it is not the default action to drop
   the database with the current user name.)
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="manage-ag-tablespaces">
  <title>Tablespaces</title>

  <indexterm zone="manage-ag-tablespaces">
   <primary>tablespace</primary>
  </indexterm>

   <para>
    Tablespaces in <productname>PostgreSQL</> allow database administrators to
    define locations in the file system where the files representing
    database objects can be stored. Once created, a tablespace can be referred
    to by name when creating database objects.
   </para>

   <para>
    By using tablespaces, an administrator can control the disk layout
    of a <productname>PostgreSQL</> installation. This is useful in at
    least two ways. First, if the partition or volume on which the
    cluster was initialized runs out of space and cannot be extended,
    a tablespace can be created on a different partition and used
    until the system can be reconfigured.
   </para>

   <para>
    Second, tablespaces allow an administrator to use knowledge of the
    usage pattern of database objects to optimize performance. For
    example, an index which is very heavily used can be placed on a
    very fast, highly available disk, such as an expensive solid state
    device. At the same time a table storing archived data which is
    rarely used or not performance critical could be stored on a less
    expensive, slower disk system.
   </para>

   <para>
    To define a tablespace, use the <xref
    linkend="sql-createtablespace" endterm="sql-createtablespace-title">
    command, for example:<indexterm><primary>CREATE TABLESPACE</></>
<programlisting>
CREATE TABLESPACE fastspace LOCATION '/mnt/sda1/postgresql/data';
</programlisting>
    The location must be an existing, empty directory that is owned by
    the <productname>PostgreSQL</> system user.  All objects subsequently
    created within the tablespace will be stored in files underneath this
    directory.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     There is usually not much point in making more than one
     tablespace per logical file system, since you cannot control the location
     of individual files within a logical file system.  However,
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> does not enforce any such limitation, and
     indeed it is not directly aware of the file system boundaries on your
     system.  It just stores files in the directories you tell it to use.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Creation of the tablespace itself must be done as a database superuser,
    but after that you can allow ordinary database users to make use of it.
    To do that, grant them the <literal>CREATE</> privilege on it.
   </para>

   <para>
    Tables, indexes, and entire databases can be assigned to
    particular tablespaces. To do so, a user with the <literal>CREATE</>
    privilege on a given tablespace must pass the tablespace name as a 
    parameter to the relevant command. For example, the following creates 
    a table in the tablespace <literal>space1</>:
<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE foo(i int) TABLESPACE space1;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Alternatively, use the <xref linkend="guc-default-tablespace"> parameter:
<programlisting>
SET default_tablespace = space1;
CREATE TABLE foo(i int);
</programlisting>
    When <varname>default_tablespace</> is set to anything but an empty
    string, it supplies an implicit <literal>TABLESPACE</> clause for
    <command>CREATE TABLE</> and <command>CREATE INDEX</> commands that
    do not have an explicit one.
   </para>

   <para>
    The tablespace associated with a database is used to store the system
    catalogs of that database, as well as any temporary files created by
    server processes using that database.  Furthermore, it is the default
    tablespace selected for tables and indexes created within the database,
    if no <literal>TABLESPACE</> clause is given (either explicitly or via
    <varname>default_tablespace</>) when the objects are created.
    If a database is created without specifying a tablespace for it,
    it uses the same tablespace as the template database it is copied from.
   </para>

   <para>
    Two tablespaces are automatically created by <literal>initdb</>. The
    <literal>pg_global</> tablespace is used for shared system catalogs. The
    <literal>pg_default</> tablespace is the default tablespace of the
    <literal>template1</> and <literal>template0</> databases (and, therefore,
    will be the default tablespace for other databases as well, unless
    overridden by a <literal>TABLESPACE</> clause in <command>CREATE
    DATABASE</>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Once created, a tablespace can be used from any database, provided
    the requesting user has sufficient privilege. This means that a tablespace
    cannot be dropped until all objects in all databases using the tablespace
    have been removed.
   </para>

   <para>
    To remove an empty tablespace, use the <xref
    linkend="sql-droptablespace" endterm="sql-droptablespace-title">
    command.
   </para>

   <para>
    To determine the set of existing tablespaces, examine the
    <structname>pg_tablespace</> system catalog, for example
<synopsis>
SELECT spcname FROM pg_tablespace;
</synopsis>
    The <xref linkend="app-psql"> program's <literal>\db</> meta-command
    is also useful for listing the existing tablespaces.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> makes extensive use of symbolic links
    to simplify the implementation of tablespaces. This
    means that tablespaces can be used <emphasis>only</> on systems
    that support symbolic links.
   </para>

   <para>
    The directory <filename>$PGDATA/pg_tblspc</> contains symbolic links that
    point to each of the non-built-in tablespaces defined in the cluster.
    Although not recommended, it is possible to adjust the tablespace
    layout by hand by redefining these links.  Two warnings: do not do so
    while the server is running; and after you restart the server,
    update the <structname>pg_tablespace</> catalog to show the new
    locations.  (If you do not, <literal>pg_dump</> will continue to show
    the old tablespace locations.)
   </para>
