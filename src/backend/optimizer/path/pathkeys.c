 * pathkey_is_redundant
 *	   Is a pathkey redundant with one already in the given list?
 *
 * We detect two cases:
 *
 * 1. If the new pathkey's equivalence class contains a constant, and isn't
 * below an outer join, then we can disregard it as a sort key.  An example:
 *			SELECT ... WHERE x = 42 ORDER BY x, y;
 * We may as well just sort by y.  Note that because of opfamily matching,
 * this is semantically correct: we know that the equality constraint is one
 * that actually binds the variable to a single value in the terms of any
 * ordering operator that might go with the eclass.  This rule not only lets
 * us simplify (or even skip) explicit sorts, but also allows matching index
 * sort orders to a query when there are don't-care index columns.
 *
 * 2. If the new pathkey's equivalence class is the same as that of any
 * existing member of the pathkey list, then it is redundant.  Some examples:
 *			SELECT ... ORDER BY x, x;
 *			SELECT ... ORDER BY x, x DESC;
 *			SELECT ... WHERE x = y ORDER BY x, y;
 * In all these cases the second sort key cannot distinguish values that are
 * considered equal by the first, and so there's no point in using it.
 * Note in particular that we need not compare opfamily (all the opfamilies
 * of the EC have the same notion of equality) nor sort direction.
 *
 * Both the given pathkey and the list members must be canonical for this
 * to work properly, but that's okay since we no longer ever construct any
 * non-canonical pathkeys.  (Note: the notion of a pathkey *list* being
 * canonical includes the additional requirement of no redundant entries,
 * which is exactly what we are checking for here.)
 *
 * Because the equivclass.c machinery forms only one copy of any EC per query,
 * pointer comparison is enough to decide whether canonical ECs are the same.

		 * A mergejoin clause matches a pathkey if it has the same EC.
		 * If there are multiple matching clauses, take them all.  In plain
		 * inner-join scenarios we expect only one match, because
		 * equivalence-class processing will have removed any redundant
		 * mergeclauses.  However, in outer-join scenarios there might be
		 * multiple matches.  An example is
		 *
		 *	select * from a full join b
		 *		on a.v1 = b.v1 and a.v2 = b.v2 and a.v1 = b.v2;
		 *
		 * Given the pathkeys ({a.v1}, {a.v2}) it is okay to return all three
		 * clauses (in the order a.v1=b.v1, a.v1=b.v2, a.v2=b.v2) and indeed
		 * we *must* do so or we will be unable to form a valid plan.
		 *
		 * We expect that the given pathkeys list is canonical, which means
		 * no two members have the same EC, so it's not possible for this
		 * code to enter the same mergeclause into the result list twice.
		 *
		 * It's possible that multiple matching clauses might have different
		 * ECs on the other side, in which case the order we put them into our
		 * result makes a difference in the pathkeys required for the inner
		 * input rel.  However this routine hasn't got any info about which
		 * order would be best, so we don't worry about that.
		 *
		 * It's also possible that the selected mergejoin clauses produce
		 * a noncanonical ordering of pathkeys for the inner side, ie, we
		 * might select clauses that reference b.v1, b.v2, b.v1 in that
		 * order.  This is not harmful in itself, though it suggests that
		 * the clauses are partially redundant.  Since the alternative is
		 * to omit mergejoin clauses and thereby possibly fail to generate a
		 * plan altogether, we live with it.  make_inner_pathkeys_for_merge()
		 * has to delete duplicates when it constructs the inner pathkeys
		 * list, and we also have to deal with such cases specially in
		 * create_mergejoin_plan().
