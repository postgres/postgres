 <para>
  A database administrator frequently wonders, <quote>What is the system
  doing right now?</quote>
  This chapter discusses how to find that out.
 </para>

  <para>
   Several tools are available for monitoring database activity and
   analyzing performance.  Most of this chapter is devoted to describing
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s cumulative statistics system,
   but one should not neglect regular Unix monitoring programs such as
   <command>ps</command>, <command>top</command>, <command>iostat</command>, and <command>vmstat</command>.
   Also, once one has identified a
   poorly-performing query, further investigation might be needed using
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <link linkend="sql-explain"><command>EXPLAIN</command></link> command.
   <xref linkend="using-explain"/> discusses <command>EXPLAIN</command>
   and other methods for understanding the behavior of an individual
   query.

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   On most Unix platforms, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> modifies its
   command title as reported by <command>ps</command>, so that individual server
   processes can readily be identified.  A sample display is

<screen>
$ ps auxww | grep ^postgres
postgres  15551  0.0  0.1  57536  7132 pts/0    S    18:02   0:00 postgres -i
postgres  15554  0.0  0.0  57536  1184 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: background writer

postgres  15556  0.0  0.0  57536   916 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: walwriter
postgres  15557  0.0  0.0  58504  2244 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: autovacuum launcher
postgres  15582  0.0  0.0  58772  3080 ?        Ss   18:04   0:00 postgres: joe runbug 127.0.0.1 idle
postgres  15606  0.0  0.0  58772  3052 ?        Ss   18:07   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] SELECT waiting
postgres  15610  0.0  0.0  58772  3056 ?        Ss   18:07   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] idle in transaction
</screen>

   (The appropriate invocation of <command>ps</command> varies across different
   platforms, as do the details of what is shown.  This example is from a
   recent Linux system.)  The first process listed here is the
   primary server process.  The command arguments
   shown for it are the same ones used when it was launched.  The next four
   processes are background worker processes automatically launched by the
   primary process.  (The <quote>autovacuum launcher</quote> process will not
   be present if you have set the system not to run autovacuum.)
   Each of the remaining
   processes is a server process handling one client connection.  Each such
   process sets its command line display in the form

<screen>
postgres: <replaceable>user</replaceable> <replaceable>database</replaceable> <replaceable>host</replaceable> <replaceable>activity</replaceable>
</screen>

  The user, database, and (client) host items remain the same for
  the life of the client connection, but the activity indicator changes.
  The activity can be <literal>idle</literal> (i.e., waiting for a client command),
  <literal>idle in transaction</literal> (waiting for client inside a <command>BEGIN</command> block),
  or a command type name such as <literal>SELECT</literal>.  Also,
  <literal>waiting</literal> is appended if the server process is presently waiting
  on a lock held by another session.  In the above example we can infer
  that process 15606 is waiting for process 15610 to complete its transaction
  and thereby release some lock.  (Process 15610 must be the blocker, because
  there is no other active session.  In more complicated cases it would be
  necessary to look into the
  <link linkend="view-pg-locks"><structname>pg_locks</structname></link>
  system view to determine who is blocking whom.)
  </para>

  <para>
   If <xref linkend="guc-cluster-name"/> has been configured the
   cluster name will also be shown in <command>ps</command> output:
<screen>
$ psql -c 'SHOW cluster_name'
 cluster_name
--------------
 server1
(1 row)

$ ps aux|grep server1
postgres   27093  0.0  0.0  30096  2752 ?        Ss   11:34   0:00 postgres: server1: background writer
...
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have turned off <xref linkend="guc-update-process-title"/> then the
   activity indicator is not updated; the process title is set only once
   when a new process is launched.  On some platforms this saves a measurable
   amount of per-command overhead;  on others it's insignificant.
  </para>

  <tip>
  <para>
  <productname>Solaris</productname> requires special handling. You must
  use <command>/usr/ucb/ps</command>, rather than
  <command>/bin/ps</command>. You also must use two <option>w</option>
  flags, not just one. In addition, your original invocation of the
  <command>postgres</command> command must have a shorter
  <command>ps</command> status display than that provided by each
  server process.  If you fail to do all three things, the <command>ps</command>
  output for each server process will be the original <command>postgres</command>
  command line.

 <sect1 id="monitoring-stats">
  <title>The Cumulative Statistics System</title>

  <indexterm zone="monitoring-stats">
   <primary>statistics</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <firstterm>cumulative statistics
   system</firstterm> supports collection and reporting of information about
   server activity.  Presently, accesses to tables and indexes in both
   disk-block and individual-row terms are counted.  The total number of rows
   in each table, and information about vacuum and analyze actions for each
   table are also counted.  If enabled, calls to user-defined functions and
   the total time spent in each one are counted as well.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also supports reporting dynamic
   information about exactly what is going on in the system right now, such as
   the exact command currently being executed by other server processes, and
   which other connections exist in the system.  This facility is independent
   of the cumulative statistics system.
  </para>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-setup">
  <title>Statistics Collection Configuration</title>

  <para>
   Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution,
   the system can be configured to collect or not collect information.
   This is controlled by configuration parameters that are normally set in
   <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>.  (See <xref linkend="runtime-config"/> for
   details about setting configuration parameters.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-activities"/> enables monitoring
   of the current command being executed by any server process.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-counts"/> controls whether
   cumulative statistics are collected about table and index accesses.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-functions"/> enables tracking of
   usage of user-defined functions.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-io-timing"/> enables monitoring
   of block read and write times.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parameter <xref linkend="guc-track-wal-io-timing"/> enables monitoring
   of WAL write times.
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally these parameters are set in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> so
   that they apply to all server processes, but it is possible to turn
   them on or off in individual sessions using the <xref
   linkend="sql-set"/> command. (To prevent
   ordinary users from hiding their activity from the administrator,
   only superusers are allowed to change these parameters with
   <command>SET</command>.)
  </para>

  <para>
   Cumulative statistics are collected in shared memory. Every
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> process collects statistics locally,
   then updates the shared data at appropriate intervals.  When a server,
   including a physical replica, shuts down cleanly, a permanent copy of the
   statistics data is stored in the <filename>pg_stat</filename> subdirectory,
   so that statistics can be retained across server restarts.  In contrast,
   when starting from an unclean shutdown (e.g., after an immediate shutdown,
   a server crash, starting from a base backup, and point-in-time recovery),
   all statistics counters are reset.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="monitoring-stats-views">
  <title>Viewing Statistics</title>

  <para>
   Several predefined views, listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-dynamic-views-table"/>, are available to show
   the current state of the system. There are also several other
   views, listed in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-views-table"/>, available to show the accumulated
   statistics.  Alternatively, one can
   build custom views using the underlying cumulative statistics functions, as
   discussed in <xref linkend="monitoring-stats-functions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When using the cumulative statistics views and functions to monitor
   collected data, it is important to realize that the information does not
   update instantaneously.  Each individual server process flushes out
   accumulated statistics to shared memory just before going idle, but not
   more frequently than once per <varname>PGSTAT_MIN_INTERVAL</varname>
   milliseconds (1 second unless altered while building the server); so a
   query or transaction still in progress does not affect the displayed totals
   and the displayed information lags behind actual activity.  However,
   current-query information collected by <varname>track_activities</varname>
   is always up-to-date.
  </para>

  <para>
   Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display
   any of the accumulated statistics, accessed values are cached until the end
   of its current transaction in the default configuration. So the statistics
   will show static information as long as you continue the current
   transaction. Similarly, information about the current queries of all
   sessions is collected when any such information is first requested within a
   transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout the
   transaction. This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform
   several queries on the statistics and correlate the results without
   worrying that the numbers are changing underneath you.

   When analyzing statistics interactively, or with expensive queries, the
   time delta between accesses to individual statistics can lead to
   significant skew in the cached statistics. To minimize skew,
   <varname>stats_fetch_consistency</varname> can be set to
   <literal>snapshot</literal>, at the price of increased memory usage for
   caching not-needed statistics data.  Conversely, if it's known that
   statistics are only accessed once, caching accessed statistics is
   unnecessary and can be avoided by setting
   <varname>stats_fetch_consistency</varname> to <literal>none</literal>.

   You can invoke <function>pg_stat_clear_snapshot</function>() to discard the
   current transaction's statistics snapshot or cached values (if any).  The
   next use of statistical information will (when in snapshot mode) cause a
   new snapshot to be built or (when in cache mode) accessed statistics to be
   cached.
  </para>

  <para>
   A transaction can also see its own statistics (not yet flushed out to the
   shared memory statistics) in the views
   <structname>pg_stat_xact_all_tables</structname>,
   <structname>pg_stat_xact_sys_tables</structname>,
   <structname>pg_stat_xact_user_tables</structname>, and
   <structname>pg_stat_xact_user_functions</structname>.  These numbers do not act as
   stated above; instead they update continuously throughout the transaction.
  </para>

  <para>
   Some of the information in the dynamic statistics views shown in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-dynamic-views-table"/> is security restricted.
   Ordinary users can only see all the information about their own sessions
   (sessions belonging to a role that they are a member of).  In rows about
   other sessions, many columns will be null.  Note, however, that the
   existence of a session and its general properties such as its sessions user
   and database are visible to all users.  Superusers and roles with privileges of
   built-in role <literal>pg_read_all_stats</literal> (see also <xref
   linkend="predefined-roles"/>) can see all the information about all sessions.

  <para>
   The per-index statistics are particularly useful to determine which
   indexes are being used and how effective they are.
  </para>

  <para>
   The <structname>pg_statio_</structname> views are primarily useful to
   determine the effectiveness of the buffer cache.  When the number
   of actual disk reads is much smaller than the number of buffer
   hits, then the cache is satisfying most read requests without
   invoking a kernel call. However, these statistics do not give the
   entire story: due to the way in which <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   handles disk I/O, data that is not in the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> buffer cache might still reside in the
   kernel's I/O cache, and might therefore still be fetched without
   requiring a physical read. Users interested in obtaining more
   detailed information on <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> I/O behavior are
   advised to use the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> statistics views
   in combination with operating system utilities that allow insight
   into the kernel's handling of I/O.

  <para>
   The lag times reported in the <structname>pg_stat_replication</structname>
   view are measurements of the time taken for recent WAL to be written,
   flushed and replayed and for the sender to know about it.  These times
   represent the commit delay that was (or would have been) introduced by each
   synchronous commit level, if the remote server was configured as a
   synchronous standby.  For an asynchronous standby, the
   <structfield>replay_lag</structfield> column approximates the delay
   before recent transactions became visible to queries.  If the standby
   server has entirely caught up with the sending server and there is no more
   WAL activity, the most recently measured lag times will continue to be
   displayed for a short time and then show NULL.
  </para>

  <para>
   Lag times work automatically for physical replication. Logical decoding
   plugins may optionally emit tracking messages; if they do not, the tracking
   mechanism will simply display NULL lag.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    The reported lag times are not predictions of how long it will take for
    the standby to catch up with the sending server assuming the current
    rate of replay.  Such a system would show similar times while new WAL is
    being generated, but would differ when the sender becomes idle.  In
    particular, when the standby has caught up completely,
    <structname>pg_stat_replication</structname> shows the time taken to
    write, flush and replay the most recent reported WAL location rather than
    zero as some users might expect.  This is consistent with the goal of
    measuring synchronous commit and transaction visibility delays for
    recent write transactions.
    To reduce confusion for users expecting a different model of lag, the
    lag columns revert to NULL after a short time on a fully replayed idle
    system. Monitoring systems should choose whether to represent this
    as missing data, zero or continue to display the last known value.

    Normally, WAL files are archived in order, oldest to newest, but that is
    not guaranteed, and does not hold under special circumstances like when
    promoting a standby or after crash recovery. Therefore it is not safe to
    assume that all files older than
    <structfield>last_archived_wal</structfield> have also been successfully
    archived.

  <para>
   Indexes can be used by simple index scans, <quote>bitmap</quote> index scans,
   and the optimizer.  In a bitmap scan
   the output of several indexes can be combined via AND or OR rules,
   so it is difficult to associate individual heap row fetches
   with specific indexes when a bitmap scan is used.  Therefore, a bitmap
   scan increments the
   <structname>pg_stat_all_indexes</structname>.<structfield>idx_tup_read</structfield>
   count(s) for the index(es) it uses, and it increments the
   <structname>pg_stat_all_tables</structname>.<structfield>idx_tup_fetch</structfield>
   count for the table, but it does not affect
   <structname>pg_stat_all_indexes</structname>.<structfield>idx_tup_fetch</structfield>.
   The optimizer also accesses indexes to check for supplied constants
   whose values are outside the recorded range of the optimizer statistics
   because the optimizer statistics might be stale.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    The <structfield>idx_tup_read</structfield> and <structfield>idx_tup_fetch</structfield> counts
    can be different even without any use of bitmap scans,
    because <structfield>idx_tup_read</structfield> counts
    index entries retrieved from the index while <structfield>idx_tup_fetch</structfield>
    counts live rows fetched from the table.  The latter will be less if any
    dead or not-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index, or if any
    heap fetches are avoided by means of an index-only scan.

   Other ways of looking at the statistics can be set up by writing
   queries that use the same underlying statistics access functions used by
   the standard views shown above.  For details such as the functions' names,
   consult the definitions of the standard views.  (For example, in
   <application>psql</application> you could issue <literal>\d+ pg_stat_activity</literal>.)
   The access functions for per-database statistics take a database OID as an
   argument to identify which database to report on.
   The per-table and per-index functions take a table or index OID.
   The functions for per-function statistics take a function OID.
   Note that only tables, indexes, and functions in the current database
   can be seen with these functions.

  <para>
   <function>pg_stat_get_activity</function>, the underlying function of
   the <structname>pg_stat_activity</structname> view, returns a set of records
   containing all the available information about each backend process.
   Sometimes it may be more convenient to obtain just a subset of this
   information.  In such cases, an older set of per-backend statistics
   access functions can be used; these are shown in <xref
   linkend="monitoring-stats-backend-funcs-table"/>.
   These access functions use a backend ID number, which ranges from one
   to the number of currently active backends.
   The function <function>pg_stat_get_backend_idset</function> provides a
   convenient way to generate one row for each active backend for
   invoking these functions.  For example, to show the <acronym>PID</acronym>s and
   current queries of all backends:

<programlisting>
SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_pid(s.backendid) AS pid,
       pg_stat_get_backend_activity(s.backendid) AS query
    FROM (SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_idset() AS backendid) AS s;
</programlisting>

  <para>
   Another useful tool for monitoring database activity is the
   <structname>pg_locks</structname> system table.  It allows the
   database administrator to view information about the outstanding
   locks in the lock manager. For example, this capability can be used
   to:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      View all the locks currently outstanding, all the locks on
      relations in a particular database, all the locks on a
      particular relation, or all the locks held by a particular
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> session.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Determine the relation in the current database with the most
      ungranted locks (which might be a source of contention among
      database clients).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Determine the effect of lock contention on overall database
      performance, as well as the extent to which contention varies
      with overall database traffic.
     </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides facilities to support
   dynamic tracing of the database server. This allows an external
   utility to be called at specific points in the code and thereby trace
   execution.
  </para>

  <para>
   A number of probes or trace points are already inserted into the source
   code. These probes are intended to be used by database developers and
   administrators. By default the probes are not compiled into
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>; the user needs to explicitly tell
   the configure script to make the probes available.
  </para>

  <para>
   Currently, the
   <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</ulink>
   utility is supported, which, at the time of this writing, is available
   on Solaris, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Oracle Linux.  The
   <ulink url="https://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</ulink> project
   for Linux provides a DTrace equivalent and can also be used.  Supporting other dynamic
   tracing utilities is theoretically possible by changing the definitions for
   the macros in <filename>src/include/utils/probes.h</filename>.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="compiling-for-trace">
   <title>Compiling for Dynamic Tracing</title>

  <para>
   By default, probes are not available, so you will need to
   explicitly tell the configure script to make the probes available
   in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. To include DTrace support
   specify <option>--enable-dtrace</option> to configure.  See <xref

   <title>Using Probes</title>

   The example below shows a DTrace script for analyzing transaction
   counts in the system, as an alternative to snapshotting
   <structname>pg_stat_database</structname> before and after a performance test:
<programlisting>
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -qs

postgresql$1:::transaction-start
{
      @start["Start"] = count();
      self->ts  = timestamp;
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-abort
{
      @abort["Abort"] = count();
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-commit
/self->ts/
{
      @commit["Commit"] = count();
      @time["Total time (ns)"] = sum(timestamp - self->ts);
      self->ts=0;
}
</programlisting>
   When executed, the example D script gives output such as:
<screen>
# ./txn_count.d `pgrep -n postgres` or ./txn_count.d &lt;PID&gt;
^C

Start                                          71
Commit                                         70
Total time (ns)                        2312105013
</screen>
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    SystemTap uses a different notation for trace scripts than DTrace does,
    even though the underlying trace points are compatible.  One point worth
    noting is that at this writing, SystemTap scripts must reference probe
    names using double underscores in place of hyphens.  This is expected to
    be fixed in future SystemTap releases.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   You should remember that DTrace scripts need to be carefully written and
   debugged, otherwise the trace information collected might
   be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the
   instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When
   discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose
   the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.

     in the source code
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Recompile and verify that the new probes are available

   <title>Example:</title>
   <para>
    Here is an example of how you would add a probe to trace all new
    transactions by transaction ID.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Decide that the probe will be named <literal>transaction-start</literal> and
     requires a parameter of type <type>LocalTransactionId</type>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Add the probe definition to <filename>src/backend/utils/probes.d</filename>:
<programlisting>
probe transaction__start(LocalTransactionId);
</programlisting>
     Note the use of the double underline in the probe name. In a DTrace
     script using the probe, the double underline needs to be replaced with a
     hyphen, so <literal>transaction-start</literal> is the name to document for
     users.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     At compile time, <literal>transaction__start</literal> is converted to a macro
     called <literal>TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START</literal> (notice the
     underscores are single here), which is available by including
     <filename>pg_trace.h</filename>.  Add the macro call to the appropriate location
     in the source code.  In this case, it looks like the following:

<programlisting>
TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(vxid.localTransactionId);
</programlisting>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     After recompiling and running the new binary, check that your newly added
     probe is available by executing the following DTrace command.  You
     should see similar output:
<screen>
# dtrace -ln transaction-start
   ID    PROVIDER          MODULE           FUNCTION NAME
18705 postgresql49878     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18755 postgresql49877     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18805 postgresql49876     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18855 postgresql49875     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18986 postgresql49873     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
</screen>
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   There are a few things to be careful about when adding trace macros
   to the C code:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You should take care that the data types specified for a probe's
      parameters match the data types of the variables used in the macro.
      Otherwise, you will get compilation errors.
     </para>
    </listitem>


    <listitem>
     <para>
      On most platforms, if <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is
      built with <option>--enable-dtrace</option>, the arguments to a trace
      macro will be evaluated whenever control passes through the
      macro, <emphasis>even if no tracing is being done</emphasis>.  This is
      usually not worth worrying about if you are just reporting the
      values of a few local variables.  But beware of putting expensive
      function calls into the arguments.  If you need to do that,
      consider protecting the macro with a check to see if the trace
      is actually enabled:

<programlisting>
if (TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START_ENABLED())
    TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(some_function(...));
</programlisting>

      Each trace macro has a corresponding <literal>ENABLED</literal> macro.
