# NOFIXADE disallows unaligned access.
#   on Ultrix and OSF/1 it invokes an explicit syscall.
#   on HP-UX it turns off certain compiler options.
# This is defined here because a bunch of clients include tmp/c.h,
# which is where the work is done on HP-UX.  It only affects the
# backend on Ultrix and OSF/1.
