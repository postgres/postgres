This is a testsuite for testing libpq URI connection string syntax.

To run the suite, use 'make installcheck' command.  It works by
running 'regress.pl' from this directory with appropriate environment
set up, which in turn feeds up lines from 'regress.in' to
'uri-regress' test program and compares the output against the correct
one in 'expected.out' file.
