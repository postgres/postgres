Names in brackets "[]" indicate more detailed information is available in
the directory pgsql/doc/TODO.detail/ under that name.


RELIABILITY
-----------

PARSER

* SELECT pg_class FROM pg_class generates strange error
* Alter TABLE ADD COLUMN does not honor DEFAULT, add CONSTRAINT
* -Creating index of TIMESTAMP & RELTIME fails, or rename to DATETIME (Thomas)
* -SELECT foo UNION SELECT foo is incorrectly simplified to SELECT foo
* Unique index on base column not honored on inserts from inherited table
  INSERT INTO inherit_table (unique_index_col) VALUES (dup) should fail
  [inheritance] 
* -Be smarter about promoting types when UNION merges different data types
* -redesign INSERT ... SELECT to have two levels of target list
* -have INTERSECT/EXCEPT prevent duplicates unless ALL is specified (Tom)
* -SELECT col::DECIMAL(12,10); fails

VIEWS

* -Views containing aggregates sometimes fail (Jan)

  duplicates [inheritance]

MISC

* Plpgsql does not handle quoted mixed-case identifiers

  promotion occurs
