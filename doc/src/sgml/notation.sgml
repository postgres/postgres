 <title>Conventions</title>

 <para>
  The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command:
  brackets (<literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal>) indicate
  optional parts.  (In the synopsis of a Tcl command, question marks
  (<literal>?</literal>) are used instead, as is usual in Tcl.)  Braces
  (<literal>{</literal> and <literal>}</literal>) and vertical lines
  (<literal>|</literal>) indicate that you must choose one
  alternative.  Dots (<literal>...</literal>) mean that the preceding element
  can be repeated.
 </para>

 <para>
  Where it enhances the clarity, SQL commands are preceded by the
  prompt <literal>=&gt;</literal>, and shell commands are preceded by the
  prompt <literal>$</literal>.  Normally, prompts are not shown, though.
 </para>

 <para>
  An <firstterm>administrator</firstterm> is generally a person who is
  in charge of installing and running the server.  A <firstterm>user</firstterm>
  could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of the
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> system.  These terms should not
  be interpreted too narrowly; this book does not have fixed
  presumptions about system administration procedures.
