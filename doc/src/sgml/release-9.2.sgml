      Further restrict visibility
      of <structname>pg_user_mappings</>.<structfield>umoptions</>, to
      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <literal>USAGE</> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</> does not
      show the options in such cases, <structname>pg_user_mappings</>
      should not either.

      By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd

       <para>
        Restart the postmaster after adding <literal>allow_system_table_mods

        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</>

        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.
        In <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5 and later, you can use
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</>, undo that with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

      Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libpq</> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <application>psql</> or other <application>libpq</>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<application>libpq</>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <literal>md5</>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

      Prevent exposure of statistical information via leaky operators
      (Peter Eisentraut)

     <para>
      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <structname>pg_statistic</>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names
      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </para>

     <para>
      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <filename>posixrules</> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <literal>US/Eastern</> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <filename>posixrules</> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <xref linkend="datatype-timezones">).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
      to take effect.

      If <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> was used to build an index

      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

      If a dynamic time zone abbreviation does not match any entry in the

      This avoids unexpected failures when IANA removes abbreviations from
      their time zone database, as they did in <application>tzdata</>
      release 2016f and seem likely to do again in the future.  The
      consequences were not limited to not recognizing the individual
      abbreviation; any mismatch caused

     </para>

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.

      Fix possible mis-evaluation of
      nested <literal>CASE</>-<literal>WHEN</> expressions (Heikki
      Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A <literal>CASE</> expression appearing within the test value
      subexpression of another <literal>CASE</> could become confused about
      whether its own test value was null or not.  Also, inlining of a SQL
      function implementing the equality operator used by
      a <literal>CASE</> expression could result in passing the wrong test
      value to functions called within a <literal>CASE</> expression in the
      SQL function's body.  If the test values were of different data
      types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused
      to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.  (CVE-2016-5423)

      Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and
      role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      Numerous places in <application>vacuumdb</> and other client programs
      could become confused by database and role names containing double
      quotes or backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe.
      Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name
      parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix handling of paired double quotes
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</>
      and <command>\password</> commands to match the documentation.
     </para>

     <para>
      Introduce a new <option>-reuse-previous</> option
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</> command to allow
      explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
      previous connection.  (Without this, the choice is based on whether
      the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This
      allows secure handling of database names containing special
      characters in <application>pg_dumpall</> scripts.
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dumpall</> now refuses to deal with database and role
      names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical
      to quote those characters safely on Windows.  In future we may reject
      such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.
     </para>

     <para>
      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
      containing special characters could have been used to execute
      commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser
      executes <application>pg_dumpall</> or other routine maintenance
      operations.  (CVE-2016-5424)

      Fix corner-case misbehaviors for <literal>IS NULL</>/<literal>IS NOT

     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard specifies that <literal>IS NULL</> should return
      TRUE for a row of all null values (thus <literal>ROW(NULL,NULL) IS
      NULL</> yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
      (thus <literal>ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL</> yields FALSE).
      The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations
      treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases),
      and <filename>contrib/postgres_fdw</> could produce remote queries
      that misbehaved similarly.

      Clear the OpenSSL error queue before OpenSSL calls, rather than

     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents problems when there are multiple connections
      using OpenSSL within a single process and not all the code involved
      follows the same rules for when to clear the error queue.
      Failures have been reported specifically when a client application
      uses SSL connections in <application>libpq</> concurrently with
      SSL connections using the PHP, Python, or Ruby wrappers for OpenSSL.
      It's possible for similar problems to arise within the server as well,

      Given a three-or-more-way equivalence class of variables, such
      as <literal>X.X = Y.Y = Z.Z</>, it was possible for the planner to omit
      some of the tests needed to enforce that all the variables are actually
      equal, leading to join rows being output that didn't satisfy
      the <literal>WHERE</> clauses.  For various reasons, erroneous plans

      In such a case, the operator family was restored into the new database,

      Perform an immediate shutdown if the <filename>postmaster.pid</> file

     </para>

     <para>
      The POSIX standard for <literal>tar</> file format does not allow
      archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern implementations
      of <application>tar</> support an extension that fixes that.  Adopt
      this extension so that <application>pg_dump</> with <option>-Ft</> no
      longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of data, and so
      that <application>pg_basebackup</> can handle files larger than 8GB.
      In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for
      members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms.  Potentially these
      problems could cause unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup

      Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few
      bytes of server memory.  We have not ruled out the viability of

     <para>
      An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases
      caused <structname>pg_trigger_tgrelid_tgname_index</> to be omitted
      from the init file.  Subsequent sessions detected this, then deemed the
      init file to be broken and silently ignored it, resulting in a
      significant degradation in session startup time.  In addition to fixing
      the bug, install some guards so that any similar future mistake will be
      more obvious.

      Disable SSL renegotiation by default (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have seen
      too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL library and
      in our usage of it.  Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and
      later.  In the older branches, just change the default value

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</>'ing data directory during
      crash restart (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would

      Allow <application>libpq</> to use TLS protocol versions beyond v1

     <para>
      For a long time, <application>libpq</> was coded so that the only SSL
      protocol it would allow was TLS v1.  Now that newer TLS versions are
      becoming popular, allow it to negotiate the highest commonly-supported
      TLS version with the server.  (<productname>PostgreSQL</> servers were
      already capable of such negotiation, so no change is needed on the
      server side.)  This is a back-patch of a change already released in
      9.4.0.

      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </para>

     <para>
      It remains possible that some calls of the <function>*printf()</>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      In <filename>contrib/pgcrypto</>, uniformly report decryption failures

     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <filename>pgcrypto</>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.

      Fix incorrect declaration of <filename>contrib/citext</>'s
      <function>regexp_matches()</> functions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These functions should return <type>setof text[]</>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <type>text[]</>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <literal>g</> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </para>

     <para>
      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <literal>citext</> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <emphasis>not</> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <literal>ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</> in each database in
      which <literal>citext</> is installed.  (You can also <quote>update</>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <filename>citext</>'s <function>regexp_matches()</> functions.

      Fix incorrect checking of deferred exclusion constraints after a HOT

     <para>
      If a new row that potentially violates a deferred exclusion constraint
      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check

      Avoid waiting for WAL flush or synchronous replication during commit of

     <para>
      Previously, a delay could occur at commit in transactions that had

      are down.  Sessions have also been observed to get stuck in catchup

      Remove code for matching IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries to

     </para>

     <para>
      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</>'s

     </para>

     <para>
      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <function>PQconsumeInput()</> upon read-ready.

      (Bruce Momjian)

     <para>
      When <function>to_char()</> processes a numeric formatting template
      calling for a large number of digits, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      would read past the end of a buffer.  When processing a crafted
      timestamp formatting template, <productname>PostgreSQL</> would write
      past the end of a buffer.  Either case could crash the server.
      We have not ruled out the possibility of attacks that lead to
      privilege escalation, though they seem unlikely.

      Fix buffer overrun in replacement <function>*printf()</> functions
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> includes a replacement implementation
      of <function>printf</> and related functions.  This code will overrun
      a stack buffer when formatting a floating point number (conversion
      specifiers <literal>e</>, <literal>E</>, <literal>f</>, <literal>F</>,
      <literal>g</> or <literal>G</>) with requested precision greater than
      about 500.  This will crash the server, and we have not ruled out the
      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
      the <function>to_char()</> SQL function.  While that is the only
      affected core <productname>PostgreSQL</> functionality, extension
      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.

      This issue primarily affects <productname>PostgreSQL</> on Windows.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      Support time zone abbreviations that change UTC offset from time to
      time (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, <productname>PostgreSQL</> assumed that the UTC offset
      associated with a time zone abbreviation (such as <literal>EST</>)
      never changes in the usage of any particular locale.  However this
      assumption fails in the real world, so introduce the ability for a
      zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
      Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
      feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
      abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
      In such timezones, <productname>PostgreSQL</> will now associate the
      correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.

      The IANA timezone database has adopted abbreviations of the form
      <literal>A<replaceable>x</>ST</literal>/<literal>A<replaceable>x</>DT</literal>
      for all Australian time zones, reflecting what they believe to be
      current majority practice Down Under.  These names do not conflict
      with usage elsewhere (other than ACST for Acre Summer Time, which has
      been in disuse since 1994).  Accordingly, adopt these names into
      our <quote>Default</> timezone abbreviation set.
      The <quote>Australia</> abbreviation set now contains only CST, EAST,
      EST, SAST, SAT, and WST, all of which are thought to be mostly
      historical usage.  Note that SAST has also been changed to be South
      Africa Standard Time in the <quote>Default</> abbreviation set.

      Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during
      <literal>make check</> (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <filename>/tmp</>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.
     </para>

     <para>
      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <literal>make check</> testing in builds that
      override <literal>DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR</>.  Popular non-default values

      Restore GIN metapages unconditionally to avoid torn-page risk
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      Although this oversight could theoretically result in a corrupted
      index, it is unlikely to have caused any problems in practice, since
      the active part of a GIN metapage is smaller than a standard 512-byte
      disk sector.

      Shore up <literal>GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION</> restrictions
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET
      ROLE</> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can
      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</> functions.

      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

      Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL
      (Robert Haas, Andres Freund)

     <para>
      If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts.  At least in the case of <command>CREATE INDEX</>,
      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed
      against a different table than the index creation, allowing for a
      privilege escalation attack.

      Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The <literal>MAXDATELEN</> constant was too small for the longest
      possible value of type <type>interval</>, allowing a buffer overrun
      in <function>interval_out()</>.  Although the datetime input
      functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the limit
      was short enough to cause them to reject some valid inputs, such as
      input containing a very long timezone name.  The <application>ecpg</>
      library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.

     <para>
      Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an
      allocation size without checking for overflow.  If overflow did
      occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past.

      Use <function>strlcpy()</> and related functions to provide a clear
      guarantee that fixed-size buffers are not overrun.  Unlike the
      preceding items, it is unclear whether these cases really represent
      live issues, since in most cases there appear to be previous
      constraints on the size of the input string.  Nonetheless it seems
      prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of this type.

      Avoid crashing if <function>crypt()</> returns NULL (Honza Horak,

     <para>
      There are relatively few scenarios in which <function>crypt()</>

      if it did.  One practical case in which this could be an issue is

      Document risks of <literal>make check</> in the regression testing

     </para>

     <para>
      Since the temporary server started by <literal>make check</>
      uses <quote>trust</> authentication, another user on the same machine
      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <literal>make check</> when there are untrusted users on the
      same machine.

     <para>
      The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially many
      pages past where it should have been.  Aside from corrupting data,
      this error has been observed to result in significant <quote>bloat</>
      of standby servers compared to their masters, due to updates being
      applied far beyond where the end-of-file should have been.  This
      failure mode does not appear to be a significant risk during crash

      base backup taken from a quickly-changing master.

      Fix <command>VACUUM</>'s tests to see whether it can
      update <structfield>relfrozenxid</> (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In some cases <command>VACUUM</> (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's <structfield>relfrozenxid</> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  In 9.2.0
      and later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible
      to get <quote>could not access status of transaction</> errors as a
      consequence of this bug.  Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8
      or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain the bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <literal>SELECT txid_current() < 2^31</>).

      Fix initialization of <filename>pg_clog</> and <filename>pg_subtrans</>
      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.

     </para>

     <para>
      Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore time, for example
      if the reason the index creation failed was because it tried to enforce
      a uniqueness condition not satisfied by the table's data.  Also, if the
      index creation is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to
      consider it to be an uncommitted DDL change, which
      <application>pg_dump</> wouldn't be expected to dump anyway.
      <application>pg_upgrade</> now also skips invalid indexes rather than
      failing.

      Fix performance problems with autovacuum truncation in busy workloads
      (Jan Wieck)
     </para>

     <para>
      Truncation of empty pages at the end of a table requires exclusive
      lock, but autovacuum was coded to fail (and release the table lock)
      when there are conflicting lock requests.  Under load, it is easily
      possible that truncation would never occur, resulting in table bloat.
      Fix by performing a partial truncation, releasing the lock, then
      attempting to re-acquire the lock and continue.  This fix also greatly
      reduces the average time before autovacuum releases the lock after a
      conflicting request arrives.

     </para>

     <para>
      Remove some data-copying overhead that was added in 9.2 as a
      consequence of revisions in the plan caching mechanism.  This
      eliminates a performance regression compared to 9.1, and also saves
      memory, especially when the query string to be executed contains many
      SQL statements.
     </para>

     <para>
      A side benefit is that multi-statement query strings are now
      processed fully serially, that is we complete execution of earlier
      statements before running parse analysis and planning on the
      following ones.  This eliminates a long-standing issue, in that DDL
      that should affect the behavior of a later statement will now behave as

      Fix multiple bugs associated with <command>CREATE/DROP INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</> (Andres Freund, Tom Lane, Simon Riggs, Pavan Deolasee)
     </para>

     <para>
      An error introduced while adding <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</>
      allowed incorrect indexing decisions to be made during the initial
      phase of <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</>; so that indexes built
      by that command could be corrupt.  It is recommended that indexes
      built in 9.2.X with <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> be rebuilt
      after applying this update.
     </para>

     <para>
      In addition, fix <command>CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <structname>pg_index</> row.  This prevents race conditions that could
      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      again resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <command>CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</> command.  The most important of these is
      <command>VACUUM</>, because an auto-vacuum could easily be launched
      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also fix <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> to not disable
      insertions into the target index until all queries using it are done.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also fix misbehavior if <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> is
      canceled: the previous coding could leave an un-droppable index behind.

      Revert patch for taking fewer snapshots (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The 9.2 change to reduce the number of snapshots taken during query
      execution led to some anomalous behaviors not seen in previous
      releases, because execution would proceed with a snapshot acquired
      before locking the tables used by the query.  Thus, for example,
      a query would not be guaranteed to see updates committed by a
      preceding transaction even if that transaction had exclusive lock.
      We'll probably revisit this in future releases, but meanwhile put it
      back the way it was before 9.2.

      Fix <application>pg_dump</>'s handling of <command>DROP DATABASE</>

     </para>

     <para>
      Beginning in 9.2.0, <literal>pg_dump --clean</> would issue a
      <command>DROP DATABASE</> command, which was either useless or
      dangerous depending on the usage scenario.  It no longer does that.
      This change also fixes the combination of <option>--clean</> and
      <option>--create</> to work sensibly, i.e., emit <command>DROP
      DATABASE</> then <command>CREATE DATABASE</> before reconnecting to the
      target database.

      The previous fix to dump relation options when a view is
      involved in a circular dependency didn't work right for the case

      Fix persistence marking of shared buffers during WAL replay
      (Jeff Davis)
     </para>

     <para>
      This mistake can result in buffers not being written out during
      checkpoints, resulting in data corruption if the server later crashes
      without ever having written those buffers.  Corruption can occur on
      any server following crash recovery, but it is significantly more
      likely to occur on standby slave servers since those perform much
      more WAL replay.  There is a low probability of corruption of btree
      and GIN indexes.  There is a much higher probability of corruption
      of table <quote>visibility maps</>, which might lead to wrong answers
      from index-only scans.  Table data proper cannot be corrupted by this
      bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      While no index corruption due to this bug is known to have occurred
      in the field, as a precautionary measure it is recommended that
      production installations <command>REINDEX</> all btree and GIN
      indexes at a convenient time after upgrading to 9.2.1.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, it is recommended to perform a <command>VACUUM</> of all tables
      while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any incorrect visibility map data.  <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-cost-delay"><varname>vacuum_cost_delay</></link>
      can be adjusted to reduce the performance impact of vacuuming, while
      causing it to take longer to finish.

        (Magnus Hagander)

       <para>
        This field was duplicative of the symbolic links that actually define

        Allow queries to retrieve data only from indexes, avoiding heap

       <para>
        This feature is often called <firstterm>index-only scans</>.
        Heap access can be skipped for heap pages containing only tuples that
        are visible to all sessions, as reported by the visibility map; so
        the benefit applies mainly to mostly-static data.  The visibility map
        was made crash-safe as a necessary part of implementing this feature.

        Allow the planner to generate custom plans for specific parameter

        (Tom Lane)
       </para>

       <para>
        In the past, a prepared statement always had a single
        <quote>generic</> plan that was used for all parameter values, which
        was frequently much inferior to the plans used for non-prepared
        statements containing explicit constant values.  Now, the planner
        attempts to generate custom plans for specific parameter values.
        A generic plan will only be used after custom plans have repeatedly
        proven to provide no benefit.  This change should eliminate the
        performance penalties formerly seen from use of prepared statements
        (including non-dynamic statements in PL/pgSQL).
