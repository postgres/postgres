DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 1.6.2 of pgsql_perl5 (previously called pg95perl5).

Pgsql_perl5 is an interface between Larry Wall's language perl version 5 and 
the database PostgreSQL (previously Postgres95). This has been done by using 
the Perl5 application programming interface for C extensions which calls the 
Postgres programmer's interface LIBPQ. Pgsql_perl5 tries to implement the LIBPQ-
interface as close as possible.

You have the choice between two different interfaces: the old C-style like 
interface and a new one, using a more Perl-ish like style. The old style 
has the benefit, that existing Libpq applications can easily be ported to 
perl. The new style uses class packages and might be more familiar for C++-
programmers.

You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.



IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <E.Mergl@bawue.de>

Please include the output of perl -v,
                         and perl -V,
           the version of PostgreSQL,
           and the version of pgsql_perl5
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.002)
  - build, test and install PostgreSQL     (at least 6.2)


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of pgsql_perl5 has been developed using Linux 2.0 with 
  dynamic loading for the perl extensions. Let me know, if there are 
  any problems with other platforms. 


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Using dynamic loading for perl extensions, the preferred method is to unpack 
the tar file outside the perl source tree. This assumes, that you already 
have installed perl5.

The Makefile checks the environment variable POSTGRES_HOME as well some 
standard locations, to find the root directory of your Postgres installation. 
 
1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )


TESTING:
--------

Run 'make test'.
Note, that the user running this script must have been created with the access 
rights to create databases *AND* users ! Do not run this script as root ! 

If you are using the shared library libpq.so, make sure, your dynamic loader 
is able to find libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v should tell 
you, where it finds libpq.so. If not, you need to add an appropriate entry to 
/etc/ld.so.conf or to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 

Some linux distributions have an incomplete perl installation. 
If you have compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", make a 
          'find /usr/lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print'
If this file is not present, you need to recompile and reinstall perl. 


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------

Detailed documentation can be found in Pg.pm. Use 'perldoc Pg' after 
installation to read the documentation.
