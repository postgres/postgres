   In general, a modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
    The platforms that had received specific testing at the
   time of release are listed in <xref linkend="supported-platforms">
   below. In the <filename>doc</> subdirectory of the distribution
   there are several platform-specific <acronym>FAQ</> documents you
   might wish to consult if you are having trouble.

      <acronym>GNU</> <application>make</> is required; other
      <application>make</> programs will <emphasis>not</> work.
      <acronym>GNU</> <application>make</> is often installed under
      the name <filename>gmake</filename>; this document will always
      refer to it by that name. (On some systems
      <acronym>GNU</acronym> <application>make</> is the default tool with the name
      <filename>make</>.) To test for <acronym>GNU</acronym>
      <application>make</application> enter
<screen>
<userinput>gmake --version</userinput>

      It is recommended to use version 3.76.1 or later.

     <para>
      To build the server programming language PL/Perl you need a full
      <productname>Perl</productname> installation, including the
      <filename>libperl</filename> library and the header files.
      Since PL/Perl will be a shared library, the
      <indexterm><primary>libperl</primary></indexterm>
      <filename>libperl</filename> library must be a shared library
      also on most platforms.  This appears to be the default in
      recent Perl versions, but it was not in earlier versions, and in
      general it is the choice of whomever installed Perl at your
      site.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you don't have the shared library but you need one, a message
      like this will appear during the build to point out this fact:
<screen>
*** Cannot build PL/Perl because libperl is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Perl installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
</screen>
      (If you don't follow the on-screen output you will merely notice
      that the PL/Perl library object, <filename>plperl.so</filename>
      or similar, will not be installed.)  If you see this, you will
      have to rebuild and install <productname>Perl</productname>
      manually to be able to build PL/Perl.  During the configuration
      process for <productname>Perl</productname>, request a shared
      library.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      To build the PL/Python server programming language, you need a
      Python installation, including the header files.  Since
      PL/Python will be a shared library, the
      <indexterm><primary>libpython</primary></indexterm>
      <filename>libpython</filename> library must be a shared library
      also on most platforms.  This is not the case in a default
      Python installation.
     </para>

     <para>
      If after building and installing you have a file called
      <filename>plpython.so</filename> (possibly a different
      extension), then everything went well.  Otherwise you should
      have seen a notice like this flying by:
<screen>
*** Cannot build PL/Python because libpython is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Python installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
</screen>
      That means you have to rebuild (part of) your Python
      installation to supply this shared library.
     </para>

     <para>
      The catch is that the Python distribution or the Python
      maintainers do not provide any direct way to do this.  The
      closest thing we can offer you is the information in <ulink
      url="http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html#3.30">Python FAQ
      3.30</ulink>.  On some operating systems you don't really have
      to build a shared library, but then you will have to convince
      the <productname>PostgreSQL</> build system of this.  Consult
      the <filename>Makefile</filename> in the
      <filename>src/pl/plpython</filename> directory for details.

     <para>
      To build the JDBC driver, you need
      <application>Ant</application> 1.5 or higher and a
      <acronym>JDK</acronym>.  <application>Ant</application> is a
      special tool for building Java-based packages.  It can be
      downloaded from the <ulink
      url="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html"><application>Ant</application>
      web site</ulink>.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you have several Java compilers installed, it depends on the
      Ant configuration which one gets used.  Precompiled
      <application>Ant</application> distributions are typically set
      up to read a file <filename>.antrc</filename> in the current
      user's home directory for configuration.  For example, to use a
      different <acronym>JDK</acronym> than the default, this may
      work:
<programlisting>
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/sun-jdk1.3
JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java
</programlisting>
     </para>

     <note>
      <para>
       Do not try to build the driver by calling
       <command>ant</command> or even <command>javac</command>
       directly.  This will not work.  Run <command>gmake</command>
       normally as described below.

      To enable Native Language Support (<acronym>NLS</acronym>), that
      is, the ability to display a program's messages in a language
      other than English, you need an implementation of the
      <application>Gettext</> <acronym>API</acronym>.  Some operating
      systems have this built-in (e.g., <systemitem
      class="osname">Linux</>, <systemitem class="osname">NetBSD</>,
      <systemitem class="osname">Solaris</>), for other systems you
      can download an add-on package from here: <ulink
      url="http://developer.postgresql.org/~petere/bsd-gettext/" ></ulink>.
      If you are using the <application>Gettext</> implementation in
      the <acronym>GNU</acronym> C library then you will additionally
      need the <productname>GNU Gettext</productname> package for some
      utility programs.  For any of the other implementations you will
      not need it.

   If you are building from a <acronym>CVS</acronym> tree instead of
   using a released source package, or if you want to do development,
   you also need the following packages:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>

      <indexterm>
       <primary>yacc</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <application>Flex</> and <application>Bison</>
      are needed to build a CVS checkout or if you changed the actual
      scanner and parser definition files. If you need them, be sure
      to get <application>Flex</> 2.5.4 or later and
      <application>Bison</> 1.875 or later. Other <application>yacc</>
      programs can sometimes be used, but doing so requires extra
      effort and is not recommended. Other <application>lex</>
      programs will definitely not work.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   If you need to get a <acronym>GNU</acronym> package, you can find
   it at your local <acronym>GNU</acronym> mirror site (see <ulink

   for a list) or at <ulink
   url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/"></ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about
   65 MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for
   the installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about
   25 MB, databases take about five times the amount of space that a
   flat text file with the same data would take. If you are going to
   run the regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra
   90 MB. Use the <command>df</command> command to check for disk
   space.

   The internal data storage format changes with new releases of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>. Therefore, if you are upgrading an
   existing installation that does not have a version number
   <quote>&majorversion;.x</quote>, you must back up and restore your
   data as shown here. These instructions assume that your existing
   installation is under the <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> directory,
   and that the data area is in <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data</>.
   Substitute your paths appropriately.

    <para>
     Make sure that your database is not updated during or after the
     backup. This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the
     changed data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit
     the permissions in the file

     If you need to preserve OIDs (such as when using them as

    <para>
     To make the backup, you can use the <command>pg_dumpall</command>
     command from the version you are currently running.  For best
     results, however, try to use the <command>pg_dumpall</command>
     command from <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> &version;,
     since this version contains bug fixes and improvements over older
     versions.  While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you
     haven't installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow
     it if you plan to install the new version in parallel with the
     old version.  In that case you can complete the installation
     normally and transfer the data later.  This will also decrease
     the downtime.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     If you are installing the new version at the same location as the
     old one then shut down the old server, at the latest before you
     install the new files:
<screen>
<userinput>kill -INT `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid | sed 1q`</>
</screen>
     Versions prior to 7.0 do not have this
     <filename>postmaster.pid</> file. If you are using such a version
     you must find out the process ID of the server yourself, for
     example by typing <userinput>ps ax | grep postmaster</>, and
     supply it to the <command>kill</> command.
    </para>

    <para>
     On systems that have <productname>PostgreSQL</> started at boot time, there is
     probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
     example, on a <systemitem class="osname">Red Hat Linux</> system one might find that
<screen>
<userinput>/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop</userinput>

     works.  Another possibility is <userinput>pg_ctl stop</>.

     If you are installing in the same place as the old version then
     it is also a good idea to move the old installation out of the
     way, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.

   <para>
    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <filename>configure</> script. For a
    default installation simply enter
<screen>
<userinput>./configure</userinput>
</screen>
    This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
    system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  (You can also run
    <filename>configure</filename> in a directory outside the source
    tree if you want to keep the build directory separate.)
   </para>

   <para>
    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> by default.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more of the following command line options to
    <filename>configure</filename>:

     <variablelist>

       <term><option>--prefix=<replaceable>PREFIX</></option></term>

        <para>
         Install all files under the directory <replaceable>PREFIX</>
         instead of <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename>. The actual
         files will be installed into various subdirectories; no files
         will ever be installed directly into the
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> directory.
        </para>

        <para>
         If you have special needs, you can also customize the

      <para>
       Care has been taken to make it possible to install
        <productname>PostgreSQL</> 
       into shared installation locations (such as
       <filename>/usr/local/include</filename>) without interfering
       with the namespace of the rest of the system.  First, the
       string <quote><literal>/postgresql</literal></quote> is
       automatically appended to <varname>datadir</varname>,
       <varname>sysconfdir</varname>, and <varname>docdir</varname>,
       unless the fully expanded directory name already contains the
       string <quote><literal>postgres</></quote> or <quote><literal>pgsql</></quote>.  For
       example, if you choose <filename>/usr/local</filename> as
       prefix, the documentation will be installed in
       <filename>/usr/local/doc/postgresql</filename>, but if the
       prefix is <filename>/opt/postgres</filename>, then it will be
       in <filename>/opt/postgres/doc</filename>.  The public C header files of the
       client interfaces are installed into
       <varname>includedir</varname> and are namespace-clean.  The
       internal header files and the server header files are installed
       into private directories under
       <varname>includedir</varname>.
       See the documentation of each interface for information about how to get at
       the its header files.
       Finally, a private subdirectory will also be created, if appropriate,
       under <varname>libdir</varname> for dynamically loadable modules.

         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing

         Also, having the tests turned on won't necessarily enhance the

         for severity, and so what might be a relatively harmless bug will
         still lead to server restarts if it triggers an assertion
         failure.  Currently, this option is not recommended for

   </note>

   <para>
    To install <productname>PostgreSQL</> enter

    This will install files into the directories that were specified

    You can use <literal>gmake install-strip</literal> instead of
    <literal>gmake install</literal> to strip the executable files and
    libraries as they are installed.  This will save some space.  If
    you built with debugging support, stripping will effectively
    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <literal>install-strip</literal>
    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.

   <para>
    The standard installation provides only the header files needed for client

    include tree into your target include directory.  To do that, enter
<screen>
<userinput>gmake install-all-headers</userinput>
</screen>
    This adds a megabyte or two to the installation footprint, and is only
    useful if you don't plan to keep the whole source tree around for

    After the installation you can make room by removing the built

    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <command>gmake distclean</>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms from the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each build.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   If you perform a build and then discover that your <command>configure</>
   options were wrong, or if you change anything that <command>configure</>
   investigates (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good
   idea to do <command>gmake distclean</> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   may not propagate everywhere they need to.

    You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such as
    <filename>/etc/profile</> or <filename>~/.bash_profile</>.  Some
    good information about the caveats associated with this method can
    be found at <ulink

<programlisting>

    If you installed into <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> or some other

    add <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</> (or whatever you set
    <option><literal>--bindir</></> to in <xref linkend="configure">)
    into your <envar>PATH</>.  Strictly speaking, this is not

    much more convenient.

   <para>
    To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as
    <filename>~/.bash_profile</> (or <filename>/etc/profile</>, if you
    want it to affect every user):
<programlisting>
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH

MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/man:$MANPATH
export MANPATH
</programlisting>

    The environment variables <envar>PGHOST</> and <envar>PGPORT</>
    specify to client applications the host and port of the database
    server, overriding the compiled-in defaults. If you are going to
    run client applications remotely then it is convenient if every
    user that plans to use the database sets <envar>PGHOST</>.  This
    is not required, however: the settings can be communicated via command
    line options to most client programs.

  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
   The following is a quick summary of how to get <productname>PostgreSQL</> up and
   running once installed. The main documentation contains more information.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create a user account for the <productname>PostgreSQL</>
     server. This is the user the server will run as. For production
     use you should create a separate, unprivileged account
     (<quote>postgres</> is commonly used). If you do not have root
     access or just want to play around, your own user account is
     enough, but running the server as root is a security risk and
     will not work.
<screen>
<userinput>adduser postgres</>
</screen>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Create a database installation with the <command>initdb</>
     command. To run <command>initdb</> you must be logged in to your
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> server account. It will not work as
     root.
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
root# <userinput>su - postgres</>
postgres$ <userinput>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The <option>-D</> option specifies the location where the data
     will be stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have
     to be under the installation directory. Just make sure that the
     server account can write to the directory (or create it, if it
     doesn't already exist) before starting <command>initdb</>, as
     illustrated here.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     The previous step should have told you how to start up the
     database server. Do so now. The command should look something
     like
<programlisting>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</programlisting>
     This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server
     in the background use something like
<programlisting>
nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    &lt;/dev/null &gt;&gt;server.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt;/dev/null &amp;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     To stop a server running in the background you can type
<programlisting>
kill `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     In order to allow TCP/IP connections (rather than only Unix
     domain socket ones) you need to pass the <option>-i</> option to
     <filename>postmaster</>.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Create a database:
<screen>
<userinput>createdb testdb</>
</screen>
     Then enter
<screen>
<userinput>psql testdb</>
</screen>
     to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL
     commands and start experimenting.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

      The <productname>PostgreSQL</> distribution contains a
      comprehensive documentation set, which you should read sometime.
      After installation, the documentation can be accessed by
      pointing your browser to
      <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/doc/html/index.html</>, unless you
      changed the installation directories.
     </para>

     <para>
      The first few chapters of the main documentation are the Tutorial,
      which should be your first reading if you are completely new to
      <acronym>SQL</> databases.  If you are familiar with database
      concepts then you want to proceed with part on server
      administration, which contains information about how to set up
      the database server, database users, and authentication.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will
      automatically start the database server whenever it boots. Some
      suggestions for this are in the documentation.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Run the regression tests against the installed server (using
      <command>gmake installcheck</command>). If you didn't run the
      tests before installation, you should definitely do it now. This
      is also explained in the documentation.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      By default, <productname>PostgreSQL</> is configured to run on
      minimal hardware.  This allows it to start up with almost any
      hardware configuration. The default configuration is, however,
      not designed for optimum performance. To achieve optimum
      performance, several server parameters must be adjusted, the two
      most common being <varname>shared_buffers</varname> and
      <varname> sort_mem</varname> mentioned in the documentation.
      Other parameters mentioned in the documentation also affect
      performance.

   <title>Unsupported Platforms:</title>
   <para>
    The following platforms are either known not to work, or they used
    to work in a previous release and we did not receive explicit
    confirmation of a successful test with version &majorversion; at
    the time this list was compiled.  We include these here to let you
    know that these platforms <emphasis>could</> be supported if given
    some attention.
