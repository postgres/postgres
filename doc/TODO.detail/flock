The latter approach is what I was going to suggest.  Writing a pid file
would be a fine idea anyway --- for one thing, it makes it a lot easier
to write a "kill the postmaster" script.  Given that the postmaster
should write a pid file, a new postmaster should look for an existing
pid file, and try to do a kill(pid, 0) on the number contained therein.
If this doesn't return an error, then you figure there is already a
postmaster running, complain, and exit.  Otherwise you figure you is it,
(re)write the pid file and away you go.  Then pqcomm.c can just
unconditionally delete any old file that's in the way of making the
pipe.

The pidfile checking and creation probably ought to go in postmaster.c,
not down inside pqcomm.c.  I never liked the fact that a critical
interlock function was being done by a low-level library that one might
not even want to invoke (if all your clients are using TCP, opening up
the Unix-domain socket is a waste of time, no?).

BTW, there is another problem with relying on flock on the socket file
for this purpose: it opens up a hole for a denial-of-service attack.
Anyone who can write the file can flock it.  (We already had a problem
with DOS via creating a dummy file at /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432, but it would
be harder to spot the culprit with an flock-based interference.)

This came to my mind, but I didn't think this would have happened so
quickly. In my opinion the socket and the pidfile should be created in a
directory owned by postgres, for example /tmp/.Pgsql-unix, like does X.

The pidfile belongs at the top level of the database directory (eg,
/usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid), because what it actually
represents is that there is a postmaster running *for that database
group*.

If you want to support multiple database sets on one machine (which I
do), then the interlock has to be per database directory.  Putting the
pidfile into a common directory would mean we'd have to invent some
kind of pidfile naming convention to keep multiple postmasters from
tromping on each other.  This is unnecessarily complex.

I agree with you that putting the socket file into a less easily munged
directory than /tmp would be a good idea for security.  But that's a
separate issue.  On machines that understand stickybits for directories,
the security hole is not really very big.

At this point, the fact that /tmp/.s.PGSQL.port# is the socket path is
effectively a version-independent aspect of the FE/BE protocol, and so
we can't change it without breaking old applications.  I'm not sure that
that's worth the security improvement.

What I'd like to see someday is a postmaster command line switch to tell
it to use *only* TCP connections and not create a Unix socket at all.
That hasn't been possible so far, because we were relying on the socket
file to provide a safety interlock against starting multiple
postmasters.  But an interlock using a pidfile would be much better.
(Look around; *every* other Unix daemon I know of that wants to ensure
that there's only one of it uses a pidfile interlock.  Not file locking.
There's a reason why that's the well-trodden path.)

	I have to agree with this one...but then it also negates the
argument about the flock() DoS...*grin*

	BTW...I like the kill(pid,0) solution myself, primarily because it
is, i think, the most portable solution.  

	I would not consider a patch to remove the flock() solution and
replace it with the kill(pid,0) solution a new feature, just an
improvement of an existing one...either way, moving the pid file (or
socket, for that matter) from /tmp should be listed as a security related
requirement for v6.4 :)

Huh?  There is no pid file being generated in /tmp (or anywhere else)
at the moment.  If we do add one, it should not go into /tmp for the
reasons I gave before.

Where the Unix-domain socket file lives is an entirely separate issue.

If we move the socket out of /tmp then we have just kicked away all the
work we did to preserve backwards compatibility of the FE/BE protocol
with existing clients.  Being able to talk to a 1.0 client isn't much
good if you aren't listening where he's going to try to contact you.
So I think I have to vote in favor of leaving the socket where it is.

   I just came up with an idea that might help alleviate the /tmp security
   exposure without creating a backwards-compatibility problem.  It works
   like this:

   1. During installation, create a subdirectory of /tmp to hold Postgres'
   socket files and associated pid lockfiles.  This subdirectory should be
   owned by the Postgres superuser and have permissions 755
   (world-readable, writable only by Postgres superuser).  Maybe call it
   /tmp/.pgsql --- the name should start with a dot to keep it out of the
   way.  (Bruce points out that some systems clear /tmp during reboot, so
   it might be that a postmaster will have to be prepared to recreate this
   directory at startup --- anyone know if subdirectories of /tmp are
   zapped too?  My system doesn't do that...)

   ...

   I notice that on my system, the X11 socket files in /tmp/.X11-unix are
   actually symlinks to socket files in /usr/spool/sockets/X11.  I dunno if
   it's worth our trouble to get into putting our sockets under /usr/spool
   or /var/spool or whatever --- seems like another configuration choice to
   mess up.  It'd be nice if the socket directory lived somewhere where the
   parent dirs weren't world-writable, but this would mean one more thing
   that you have to have root permissions for in order to install pgsql.

It seems like we need a directory for locks (= pid files) and one for
sockets (perhaps the same one).  I strongly suggest that the location
for these be configurable.  By default, it might make sense to put
them in ~pgsql/locks and ~pgsql/sockets.  It is easy (i.e., I'll be
glad to do it) to modify configure.in to take options like

	     --lock-dir=/var/spool/lock
	     --socket-dir=/var/spool/sockets

that set cc defines and have the code respond accordingly.  This way,
those who don't care (or don't have root access) can use the defaults,
whereas those with root access who like to keep locks and sockets in a
common place can do so easily.  Either way, multiple postmasters (all
compiled with the same options of course) can check the appropriate
locks in the well-known places.  Finally, drop the link into /tmp for
the old socket and document that it will be disappearing at some
point, and all is fine.  

If someone wants to give me some guidance on what preprocessor
variables should be set in response to the above options (or something
like them), I'll do the configure stuff.

Cheers,
Brook
