# Reference point for ABI compliance checks
#
# This file lists commits on the current branch that break ABI compatibility in
# ways that have been deemed acceptable (e.g., removing an extern function with
# no third-party uses).  The primary intent of this file is to control the ABI
# compliance checks on the buildfarm, but it also serves as a central location
# to document the justification for each.
#
# In general, entries should be added reactively after an abi-compliance-check
# buildfarm failure.  It is important to verify the details of the breakage
# match expectations, as the first entry listed will become the updated ABI
# baseline point.
#
# Add new entries by adding the output of the following to the top of the file:
#
# $ git log --pretty=format:"%H%n#%n# %s%n# %cd%n#%n# <ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" $ABIBREAKGITHASH -1 --date=iso
#
# Be sure to replace "<ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" with details of your change and
# why it is deemed acceptable.

# Fix trigger transition table capture for MERGE in CTE queries.

#
# This commit changed the TransitionCaptureState structure, replacing
# the "tcs_private" field with 3 separate fields. This structure can
# only be built using MakeTransitionCaptureState(), and PGXN contained
# no calls to MakeTransitionCaptureState() or uses of the
# TransitionCaptureState structure.

# This changed PrepareToInvalidateCacheTuple() parameters.  PGXN contained no
# calls to that function.

#
# This commit added a parameter to CreateStatistics().  We are unaware of any
# impacted third-party code.

#
# This is the original ABI baseline point for REL_15_STABLE.  The first entry
# would ordinarily point to something just before the .0 release, but this file
# was first added in October 2025, and we're unlikely to act upon ABI breaks in
# released minor versions, so we've chosen to truncate the ABI history to start
# with the most recent ABI break documented in the git commit history.
