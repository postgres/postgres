   <title>Migration to Version 9.5.8</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, if you use foreign data servers that make use of user
    passwords for authentication, see the first changelog entry below.

      Further restrict visibility
      of <structname>pg_user_mappings</>.<structfield>umoptions</>, to
      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <literal>USAGE</> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</> does not
      show the options in such cases, <structname>pg_user_mappings</>
      should not either.

      By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      databases.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing database,
      you will need to do the following:
     </para>

     <procedure>
      <step>
       <para>
        Restart the postmaster after adding <literal>allow_system_table_mods
        = true</> to <filename>postgresql.conf</>.  (In versions
        supporting <command>ALTER SYSTEM</>, you can use that to make the
        configuration change, but you'll still need a restart.)

      </step>

      <step>
       <para>
        In <emphasis>each</> database of the cluster,

        Do not forget to include the <literal>template0</>
        and <literal>template1</> databases, or the vulnerability will still
        exist in databases you create later.  To fix <literal>template0</>,
        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.
        In <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5 and later, you can use
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
</programlisting>
        and then after fixing <literal>template0</>, undo that with
<programlisting>
ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;
</programlisting>
        In prior versions, instead use
<programlisting>
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';

      Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libpq</> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <application>psql</> or other <application>libpq</>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<application>libpq</>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <literal>md5</>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

      Fix concurrent locking of tuple update chains (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera)
     </para>

     <para>
      If several sessions concurrently lock a tuple update chain with
      nonconflicting lock modes using an old snapshot, and they all
      succeed, it was possible for some of them to nonetheless fail (and
      conclude there is no live tuple version) due to a race condition.
      This had consequences such as foreign-key checks failing to see a
      tuple that definitely exists but is being updated concurrently.

      Failure to do this meant that when falling back from SSL to non-SSL

      The previous coding allowed the owner of a foreign server object,

      This might well include passwords for other users.

      these options are visible to the user being mapped, or if the mapping

      Prevent exposure of statistical information via leaky operators
      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <structname>pg_statistic</>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      Fix possibly-invalid initial snapshot during logical decoding
      (Petr Jelinek, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The initial snapshot created for a logical decoding replication slot
      was potentially incorrect.  This could cause third-party tools that
      use logical decoding to copy incomplete/inconsistent initial data.
      This was more likely to happen if the source server was busy at the
      time of slot creation, or if another logical slot already existed.

     <para>
      If you are using a replication tool that depends on logical decoding,
      and it should have copied a nonempty data set at the start of
      replication, it is advisable to recreate the replica after
      installing this update, or to verify its contents against the source

      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names

     <para>
      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <filename>posixrules</> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <literal>US/Eastern</> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <filename>posixrules</> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <xref linkend="datatype-timezones">).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes

      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

      Prevent failure of obsolete dynamic time zone abbreviations (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a dynamic time zone abbreviation does not match any entry in the
      referenced time zone, treat it as equivalent to the time zone name.
      This avoids unexpected failures when IANA removes abbreviations from
      their time zone database, as they did in <application>tzdata</>
      release 2016f and seem likely to do again in the future.  The
      consequences were not limited to not recognizing the individual
      abbreviation; any mismatch caused
      the <structname>pg_timezone_abbrevs</> view to fail altogether.

      Switch to numeric abbreviations for some time zones in Antarctica,
      the former Soviet Union, and Sri Lanka.
     </para>

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <structname>pg_timezone_names</>
      view nor used for output.
     </para>

     <para>
      In this update, <literal>AMT</> is no longer shown as being in use to
      mean Armenia Time.  Therefore, we have changed the <literal>Default</>
      abbreviation set to interpret it as Amazon Time, thus UTC-4 not UTC+4.

      Fix possible mis-evaluation of
      nested <literal>CASE</>-<literal>WHEN</> expressions (Heikki
      Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A <literal>CASE</> expression appearing within the test value
      subexpression of another <literal>CASE</> could become confused about
      whether its own test value was null or not.  Also, inlining of a SQL
      function implementing the equality operator used by
      a <literal>CASE</> expression could result in passing the wrong test
      value to functions called within a <literal>CASE</> expression in the
      SQL function's body.  If the test values were of different data
      types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused
      to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.  (CVE-2016-5423)

      Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and
      role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      Numerous places in <application>vacuumdb</> and other client programs
      could become confused by database and role names containing double
      quotes or backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe.
      Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name
      parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix handling of paired double quotes
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</>
      and <command>\password</> commands to match the documentation.
     </para>

     <para>
      Introduce a new <option>-reuse-previous</> option
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</> command to allow
      explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
      previous connection.  (Without this, the choice is based on whether
      the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This
      allows secure handling of database names containing special
      characters in <application>pg_dumpall</> scripts.
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dumpall</> now refuses to deal with database and role
      names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical
      to quote those characters safely on Windows.  In future we may reject
      such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.
     </para>

     <para>
      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
      containing special characters could have been used to execute
      commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser
      executes <application>pg_dumpall</> or other routine maintenance
      operations.  (CVE-2016-5424)

      Fix corner-case misbehaviors for <literal>IS NULL</>/<literal>IS NOT
      NULL</> applied to nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard specifies that <literal>IS NULL</> should return
      TRUE for a row of all null values (thus <literal>ROW(NULL,NULL) IS
      NULL</> yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
      (thus <literal>ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL</> yields FALSE).
      The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations
      treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases),
      and <filename>contrib/postgres_fdw</> could produce remote queries
      that misbehaved similarly.

     <para>
      On heavily loaded machines, the regression tests sometimes failed due
      to reporting <quote>lock timeout</> even though the statement timeout
      should have occurred first.

      Clear the OpenSSL error queue before OpenSSL calls, rather than
      assuming it's clear already; and make sure we leave it clear
      afterwards (Peter Geoghegan, Dave Vitek, Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents problems when there are multiple connections
      using OpenSSL within a single process and not all the code involved
      follows the same rules for when to clear the error queue.
      Failures have been reported specifically when a client application
      uses SSL connections in <application>libpq</> concurrently with
      SSL connections using the PHP, Python, or Ruby wrappers for OpenSSL.
      It's possible for similar problems to arise within the server as well,
      if an extension module establishes an outgoing SSL connection.

      Fix incorrect handling of equivalence-class tests in multilevel

     <para>
      Given a three-or-more-way equivalence class of variables, such
      as <literal>X.X = Y.Y = Z.Z</>, it was possible for the planner to omit
      some of the tests needed to enforce that all the variables are actually
      equal, leading to join rows being output that didn't satisfy
      the <literal>WHERE</> clauses.  For various reasons, erroneous plans
      were seldom selected in practice, so that this bug has gone undetected
      for a long time.

      Disable abbreviated keys for string sorting in non-<literal>C</>
      locales (Robert Haas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5 introduced logic for speeding up
      comparisons of string data types by using the standard C library
      function <function>strxfrm()</> as a substitute
      for <function>strcoll()</>.  It now emerges that most versions of
      glibc (Linux's implementation of the C library) have buggy
      implementations of <function>strxfrm()</> that, in some locales,
      can produce string comparison results that do not
      match <function>strcoll()</>.  Until this problem can be better
      characterized, disable the optimization in all non-<literal>C</>
      locales.  (<literal>C</> locale is safe since it uses
      neither <function>strcoll()</> nor <function>strxfrm()</>.)
     </para>

     <para>
      Unfortunately, this problem affects not only sorting but also entry
      ordering in B-tree indexes, which means that B-tree indexes
      on <type>text</>, <type>varchar</>, or <type>char</> columns may now
      be corrupt if they sort according to an affected locale and were
      built or modified under <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5.0 or 9.5.1.
      Users should <command>REINDEX</> indexes that might be affected.
     </para>

     <para>
      It is not possible at this time to give an exhaustive list of
      known-affected locales.  <literal>C</> locale is known safe, and
      there is no evidence of trouble in English-based locales such
      as <literal>en_US</>, but some other popular locales such
      as <literal>de_DE</> are affected in most glibc versions.

      In a session that performs queries as more than one role, the plan
      cache might incorrectly re-use a plan that was generated for another

      Fix incorrect handling of indexed <literal>ROW()</> comparisons
      (Simon Riggs)
     </para>

     <para>
      Flaws in a minor optimization introduced in 9.5 caused incorrect
      results if the <literal>ROW()</> comparison matches the index ordering
      partially but not exactly (for example, differing column order, or the
      index contains both <literal>ASC</> and <literal>DESC</> columns).
      Pending a better solution, the optimization has been removed.

      recovery has reached a consistent state (Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, standby servers would delay application of WAL records in
      response to <varname>recovery_min_apply_delay</> even while replaying
      the initial portion of WAL needed to make their database state valid.
      Since the standby is useless until it's reached a consistent database
      state, this was deemed unhelpful.

      In principle, both versions of <application>PL/Python</> can be used in
      the same database, though not in the same session (because the two
      versions of <application>libpython</> cannot safely be used concurrently).
      However, <application>pg_restore</> and <application>pg_upgrade</> both
      do things that can fall foul of the same-session restriction.  Work
      around that by changing the timing of the check.

     <para>
      Adjust <link linkend="sql-precedence">operator precedence</>
      to match the <acronym>SQL</> standard (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The precedence of <literal>&lt;=</literal>, <literal>&gt;=</literal>
      and <literal>&lt;&gt;</literal> has been reduced to match that of
      <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&gt;</literal>
      and <literal>=</literal>.  The precedence of <literal>IS</> tests
      (e.g., <replaceable>x</> <literal>IS NULL</>) has been reduced to be
      just below these six comparison operators.
      Also, multi-keyword operators beginning with <literal>NOT</> now have
      the precedence of their base operator (for example, <literal>NOT
      BETWEEN</> now has the same precedence as <literal>BETWEEN</>) whereas
      before they had inconsistent precedence, behaving like <literal>NOT</>
      with respect to their left operand but like their base operator with
      respect to their right operand.  The new configuration
      parameter <xref linkend="guc-operator-precedence-warning"> can be
      enabled to warn about queries in which these precedence changes result
      in different parsing choices.

      Use assignment cast behavior for data type conversions

     </para>

     <para>
      This change causes conversions of Booleans to strings to
      produce <literal>true</> or <literal>false</>, not <literal>t</>
      or <literal>f</>.  Other type conversions may succeed in more cases
      than before; for example, assigning a numeric value <literal>3.9</> to
      an integer variable will now assign 4 rather than failing.  If no
      assignment-grade cast is defined for the particular source and
      destination types, <application>PL/pgSQL</> will fall back to its old
      I/O conversion behavior.

     <para>
      While SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, it has caused enough
      bugs to be considered a net negative in practice, and it is due to be
      removed from future versions of the relevant standards.  We have
      therefore removed support for it from <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
      The <varname>ssl_renegotiation_limit</> parameter still exists, but
      cannot be set to anything but zero (disabled).  It's not documented
      anymore, either.
