> Thomas, do you need help on outer joins?

Yes. I'm going slowly partly because I get distracted with other
Postgres stuff like docs, and partly because I don't understand all of
the pieces I'm working with.

I've identified the place in the MergeJoin code where the null filling
for outer joins needs to happen, and have the "merge walk" code done.
But I don't have the supporting code which actually would know how to
null-fill a result tuple from the left or right. I thought you might be
interested in that?

I've done some work in the parser, and can now do things like:

postgres=> select * from t1 join t2 using (i);
NOTICE:  JOIN not yet implemented
i|j|i|k
-+-+-+-
1|2|1|3
(1 row)

But this is just an inner join, and the result isn't quite right since
the second "i" column should probably be omitted. At the moment I
transform it from the syntax above into existing parse nodes, and
everything from there on works.

I don't yet pass an explicit join node into the planner/optimizer, and
that will be the hardest part I assume. Perhaps we can work on that
together.

So, what I'll try to do (soon, in the next few days?) is put in

  #ifdef ENABLE_OUTER_JOINS

conditional code into the parser area (already there for the executor)
and commit everything to the development tree. Does that sound OK?

Oh, and if anyone is looking for something to do, I've got a couple of
CASE statements in the case.sql regression test which are commented out
because they crash the backend. They involve references to multiple
tables within a single result column, and in other contexts that
construct works. It would be great if someone had time to track it
down...

I've modified executor/nodeMergeJoin.c to walk a left/right/both outer
join, but didn't fill in the part which actually creates the result
tuple (which will be the current left- or right-side tuple plus nulls
for filler). I hope this is up your alley :)

So far, I'm not certain what to pass to the planner. The syntax leads me
to pass a select structure from gram.y with a "JoinExpr" structure in
the "fromClause" list. I need to expand that with a combination of
column names and qualifications, but at the time I see the JoinExpr I
don't have access to the top query structure itself. So I may just keep
a modestly transformed JoinExpr to expand later or to pass to the
planner.

btw, the EXCEPT/INTERSECT stuff from Stefan has some ugliness in gram.y
which needs to be fixed (the shift/reduce conflict is not acceptable for
our release version) and some of that code clearly needs to move to
analyze.c or some other module.

Is your solution going to be to make sure the OUTER table is always a
MergeJoin, or on the outside of a join loop?  That could work.

That could get tricky if the table is joined to _two_ other tables. 
With the cleaned-up optimizer, we can disable non-merge joins in certain
circumstances, and prevent OUTER tables from being inner in the others. 
Is that the plan?

Hadn't thought about it, other than figuring that implementing the
equi-join first was a good start. There is a class of outer join syntax
(the USING clause) which is implicitly an equi-join...

So far I don't have enough info in the parser to get the
planner/optimizer going. Should we work from the front to the back, or
should I go ahead and look at the non-merge joins? It's painfully
obvious that I don't know anything about the middle parts of this to
proceed without lots more research.

Just thinking...

If the initial RelOptInfo groupings are derived from the WHERE clause
expressions, how about marking the "outer" property in those expressions
in the parser? istm that is where the parser knows about two tables in
one place, and I'm generating those expressions anyway. We could add a
field(s) to the expression structure, or pass along a slightly different
structure...
