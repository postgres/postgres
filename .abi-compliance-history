# Reference point for ABI compliance checks
#
# This file lists commits on the current branch that break ABI compatibility in
# ways that have been deemed acceptable (e.g., removing an extern function with
# no third-party uses).  The primary intent of this file is to control the ABI
# compliance checks on the buildfarm, but it also serves as a central location
# to document the justification for each.
#
# In general, entries should be added reactively after an abi-compliance-check
# buildfarm failure.  It is important to verify the details of the breakage
# match expectations, as the first entry listed will become the updated ABI
# baseline point.
#
# Add new entries by adding the output of the following to the top of the file:
#
# $ git log --pretty=format:"%H%n#%n# %s%n# %cd%n#%n# <ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" $ABIBREAKGITHASH -1 --date=iso
#
# Be sure to replace "<ADD JUSTIFICATION HERE>" with details of your change and
# why it is deemed acceptable.

# This is the original ABI baseline point for REL_15_STABLE.  The first entry
# would ordinarily point to something just before the .0 release, but this file
# was first added in October 2025, and we're unlikely to act upon ABI breaks in
# released minor versions, so we've chosen to truncate the ABI history to start
# with the most recent ABI break documented in the git commit history.
