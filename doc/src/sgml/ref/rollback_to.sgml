  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was
   established.  The savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to
   again later, if needed.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</> implicitly destroys all savepoints that
   were established after the named savepoint.
  </para>

  <title>Notes</title>

  <para>
   Use <xref linkend="SQL-RELEASE-SAVEPOINT"
   endterm="SQL-RELEASE-SAVEPOINT-TITLE"> to destroy a savepoint without
   discarding the effects of commands executed after it was established.
  </para>

  <para>
   Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.
  </para>

  <para>
   Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to
   savepoints.  Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed
   when the savepoint is rolled back.  If a previously opened cursor is
   affected by a 
   <command>FETCH</> command inside a savepoint that is later rolled
   back, the cursor position remains at the position that <command>FETCH</>
   left it pointing to (that is, <command>FETCH</> is not rolled back).
   Closing a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either.
   A cursor whose execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a
   cannot-execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using
   <command>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</>, the cursor can no longer be used.
  </para>

  <title>Examples</title>

  <para>
   To undo the effects of the commands executed after <literal>my_savepoint</literal>
   was established:
<programlisting>
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Cursor positions are not affected by savepoint rollback:
<programlisting>
BEGIN;

DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2;

SAVEPOINT foo;

FETCH 1 FROM foo;
 ?column? 
----------
        1

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT foo;

FETCH 1 FROM foo;
 ?column? 
----------
        2

COMMIT;
</programlisting>
   </para>

  <title>Compatibility</title>

  <para>
   The <acronym>SQL</> standard specifies that the key word
   <literal>SAVEPOINT</> is mandatory, but <productname>PostgreSQL</>
   and <productname>Oracle</> allow it to be omitted.  SQL allows
   only <literal>WORK</>, not <literal>TRANSACTION</>, as a noise word
   after <literal>ROLLBACK</>.  Also, SQL has an optional clause
   <literal>AND [ NO ] CHAIN</> which is not currently supported by
   <productname>PostgreSQL</>.  Otherwise, this command conforms to
   the SQL standard.
