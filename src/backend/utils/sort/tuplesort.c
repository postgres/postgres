 * tuplesort.c
 *	  Generalized tuple sorting routines.
 *
 * This module handles sorting of heap tuples, index tuples, or single
 * Datums (and could easily support other kinds of sortable objects,
 * if necessary).  It works efficiently for both small and large amounts
 * of data.  Small amounts are sorted in-memory using qsort().	Large
 * amounts are sorted using temporary files and a standard external sort
 * algorithm.
 *
 * See Knuth, volume 3, for more than you want to know about the external
 * sorting algorithm.  We divide the input into sorted runs using replacement
 * selection, in the form of a priority tree implemented as a heap
 * (essentially his Algorithm 5.2.3H), then merge the runs using polyphase
 * merge, Knuth's Algorithm 5.4.2D.  The logical "tapes" used by Algorithm D
 * are implemented by logtape.c, which avoids space wastage by recycling
 * disk space as soon as each block is read from its "tape".
 *
 * We do not form the initial runs using Knuth's recommended replacement
 * selection data structure (Algorithm 5.4.1R), because it uses a fixed
 * number of records in memory at all times.  Since we are dealing with
 * tuples that may vary considerably in size, we want to be able to vary
 * the number of records kept in memory to ensure full utilization of the
 * allowed sort memory space.  So, we keep the tuples in a variable-size
 * heap, with the next record to go out at the top of the heap.  Like
 * Algorithm 5.4.1R, each record is stored with the run number that it
 * must go into, and we use (run number, key) as the ordering key for the
 * heap.  When the run number at the top of the heap changes, we know that
 * no more records of the prior run are left in the heap.
 *
 * The approximate amount of memory allowed for any one sort operation
 * is specified in kilobytes by the caller (most pass work_mem).  Initially,
 * we absorb tuples and simply store them in an unsorted array as long as
 * we haven't exceeded workMem.  If we reach the end of the input without
 * exceeding workMem, we sort the array using qsort() and subsequently return
 * tuples just by scanning the tuple array sequentially.  If we do exceed
 * workMem, we construct a heap using Algorithm H and begin to emit tuples
 * into sorted runs in temporary tapes, emitting just enough tuples at each
 * step to get back within the workMem limit.  Whenever the run number at
 * the top of the heap changes, we begin a new run with a new output tape
 * (selected per Algorithm D).	After the end of the input is reached,
 * we dump out remaining tuples in memory into a final run (or two),
 * then merge the runs using Algorithm D.
 *
 * When merging runs, we use a heap containing just the frontmost tuple from
 * each source run; we repeatedly output the smallest tuple and insert the
 * next tuple from its source tape (if any).  When the heap empties, the merge
 * is complete.  The basic merge algorithm thus needs very little memory ---
 * only M tuples for an M-way merge, and M is constrained to a small number.
 * However, we can still make good use of our full workMem allocation by
 * pre-reading additional tuples from each source tape.  Without prereading,
 * our access pattern to the temporary file would be very erratic; on average
 * we'd read one block from each of M source tapes during the same time that
 * we're writing M blocks to the output tape, so there is no sequentiality of
 * access at all, defeating the read-ahead methods used by most Unix kernels.
 * Worse, the output tape gets written into a very random sequence of blocks
 * of the temp file, ensuring that things will be even worse when it comes
 * time to read that tape.	A straightforward merge pass thus ends up doing a
 * lot of waiting for disk seeks.  We can improve matters by prereading from
 * each source tape sequentially, loading about workMem/M bytes from each tape
 * in turn.  Then we run the merge algorithm, writing but not reading until
 * one of the preloaded tuple series runs out.	Then we switch back to preread
 * mode, fill memory again, and repeat.  This approach helps to localize both
 * read and write accesses.
 *
 * When the caller requests random access to the sort result, we form
 * the final sorted run on a logical tape which is then "frozen", so
 * that we can access it randomly.	When the caller does not need random
 * access, we return from tuplesort_performsort() as soon as we are down
 * to one run per logical tape.  The final merge is then performed
 * on-the-fly as the caller repeatedly calls tuplesort_getXXX; this
 * saves one cycle of writing all the data out to disk and reading it in.
 *
 * Before Postgres 8.2, we always used a seven-tape polyphase merge, on the
 * grounds that 7 is the "sweet spot" on the tapes-to-passes curve according
 * to Knuth's figure 70 (section 5.4.2).  However, Knuth is assuming that
 * tape drives are expensive beasts, and in particular that there will always
 * be many more runs than tape drives.	In our implementation a "tape drive"
 * doesn't cost much more than a few Kb of memory buffers, so we can afford
 * to have lots of them.  In particular, if we can have as many tape drives
 * as sorted runs, we can eliminate any repeated I/O at all.  In the current
 * code we determine the number of tapes M on the basis of workMem: we want
 * workMem/M to be large enough that we read a fair amount of data each time
 * we preread from a tape, so as to maintain the locality of access described
 * above.  Nonetheless, with large workMem we can have many tapes.

 * The objects we actually sort are SortTuple structs.	These contain
 * a pointer to the tuple proper (might be a MinimalTuple or IndexTuple),
 * which is a separate palloc chunk --- we assume it is just one chunk and
 * can be freed by a simple pfree().  SortTuples also contain the tuple's
 * first key column in Datum/nullflag format, and an index integer.
 *
 * Storing the first key column lets us save heap_getattr or index_getattr
 * calls during tuple comparisons.	We could extract and save all the key
 * columns not just the first, but this would increase code complexity and
 * overhead, and wouldn't actually save any comparison cycles in the common
 * case where the first key determines the comparison result.  Note that
 * for a pass-by-reference datatype, datum1 points into the "tuple" storage.
 *
 * When sorting single Datums, the data value is represented directly by
 * datum1/isnull1.	If the datatype is pass-by-reference and isnull1 is false,
 * then datum1 points to a separately palloc'd data value that is also pointed
 * to by the "tuple" pointer; otherwise "tuple" is NULL.
 *
 * While building initial runs, tupindex holds the tuple's run number.  During
 * merge passes, we re-use it to hold the input tape number that each tuple in
 * the heap was read from, or to hold the index of the next tuple pre-read
 * from the same tape in the case of pre-read entries.	tupindex goes unused

 * NOTES about on-tape representation of tuples:
 *
 * We require the first "unsigned int" of a stored tuple to be the total size
 * on-tape of the tuple, including itself (so it is never zero; an all-zero
 * unsigned int is used to delimit runs).  The remainder of the stored tuple
 * may or may not match the in-memory representation of the tuple ---
 * any conversion needed is the job of the writetup and readtup routines.
 *
 * If state->randomAccess is true, then the stored representation of the
 * tuple must be followed by another "unsigned int" that is a copy of the
 * length --- so the total tape space used is actually sizeof(unsigned int)
 * more than the stored length value.  This allows read-backwards.	When
 * randomAccess is not true, the write/read routines may omit the extra
 * length word.
 *
 * writetup is expected to write both length words as well as the tuple
 * data.  When readtup is called, the tape is positioned just after the
 * front length word; readtup must read the tuple data and advance past
 * the back length word (if present).
 *
 * The write/read routines can make use of the tuple description data
 * stored in the Tuplesortstate record, if needed.	They are also expected
 * to adjust state->availMem by the amount of memory space (not tape space!)
 * released or consumed.  There is no error return from either writetup
 * or readtup; they should ereport() on failure.
 *
 *
 * NOTES about memory consumption calculations:
 *
 * We count space allocated for tuples against the workMem limit, plus
 * the space used by the variable-size memtuples array.  Fixed-size space
 * is not counted; it's small enough to not be interesting.
 *
 * Note that we count actual space used (as shown by GetMemoryChunkSpace)
 * rather than the originally-requested size.  This is important since
 * palloc can add substantial overhead.  It's not a complete answer since
 * we won't count any wasted space in palloc allocation blocks, but it's
 * a lot better than what we were doing before 7.3.
