   This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.1.1.

  <sect2>
   <title>Migration to Version 9.1.2</title>

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.1.X.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, a longstanding error was discovered in the definition of the
    <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view.  If you
    rely on correct results from that view, you should replace its
    definition as explained in the first changelog item below.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also, if your installation was upgraded from a previous major release
    by running <application>pg_upgrade</>, and it contains table columns of
    the <type>citext</> data type, you should run <literal>CREATE EXTENSION
    citext FROM unpackaged</>.  If you've already done that before
    upgrading to 9.1.2, you will instead need to do manual catalog updates
    as explained in the second changelog item.

     <para>
      Fix bugs in <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the view definition is installed by <application>initdb</>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this
      in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the
      <literal>information_schema</> schema then re-create it by sourcing
      <filename><replaceable>SHAREDIR</>/information_schema.sql</filename>.
      (Run <literal>pg_config --sharedir</> if you're uncertain where
      <replaceable>SHAREDIR</> is.)  This must be repeated in each database
      to be fixed.

     <para>
      Make <filename>contrib/citext</>'s upgrade script fix collations of
      <type>citext</> columns and indexes (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Existing <type>citext</> columns and indexes aren't correctly marked as
      being of a collatable data type during <application>pg_upgrade</> from
      a pre-9.1 server.  That leads to operations on them failing with errors
      such as <quote>could not determine which collation to use for string
      comparison</>.  This change allows them to be fixed by the same
      script that upgrades the <type>citext</> module into a proper 9.1
      extension during <literal>CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged</>.
     </para>

     <para>
      If you have a previously-upgraded database that is suffering from this
      problem, and you already ran the <command>CREATE EXTENSION</> command,
      you can manually run (as superuser) the <command>UPDATE</> commands
      found at the end of
      <filename><replaceable>SHAREDIR</>/extension/citext--unpackaged--1.0.sql</filename>.

      Fix incorrect replay of WAL records for GIN index updates

      This could result in transiently failing to find index entries after
      a crash, or on a hot-standby server.  The problem would be repaired
      by the next <command>VACUUM</> of the index, however.

     </para>

     <para>
      If a table has been modified by <command>ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</>,
      attempts to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce
      corrupt results in certain corner cases.
      The problem can only manifest in this precise form in 8.4 and later,
      but we patched earlier versions as well in case there are other code
      paths that could trigger the same bug.

      Fix race condition during toast table access from stale syscache entries
      (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      The typical symptom was transient errors like <quote>missing chunk
      number 0 for toast value NNNNN in pg_toast_2619</>, where the cited
      toast table would always belong to a system catalog.

      Track dependencies of functions on items used in parameter default
      expressions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, a referenced object could be dropped without having dropped
      or modified the function, leading to misbehavior when the function was
      used.  Note that merely installing this update will not fix the missing
      dependency entries; to do that, you'd need to <command>CREATE OR
      REPLACE</> each such function afterwards.  If you have functions whose
      defaults depend on non-built-in objects, doing so is recommended.

      Fix index matching for operators with both collatable and noncollatable

     </para>

     <para>
      In 9.1.0, an indexable operator that has a non-collatable left-hand
      input type and a collatable right-hand input type would not be
      recognized as matching the left-hand column's index.  An example is
      the <type>hstore</> <literal>?</> <type>text</> operator.

      A deferred uniqueness constraint might not hold intra-transaction,

     </para>

     <para>
      This change affects no core code, but might prevent crashes in add-on
      code that expects <function>DatumGetInetP()</> to produce an unpacked
      datum as per usual convention.

      Improve locale support in <type>money</> type's input and output

     <para>
      Aside from not supporting all standard
      <link linkend="guc-lc-monetary"><varname>lc_monetary</></link>
      formatting options, the input and output functions were inconsistent,
      meaning there were locales in which dumped <type>money</> values could

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <varname>transform_null_equals</> is only supposed to affect
      <literal>foo = NULL</> expressions written directly by the user, not
      equality checks generated internally by this form of <literal>CASE</>.

     <para>
      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</> trigger and the
      <literal>CHECK</> trigger as one event.  The <literal>ON UPDATE</>
      trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

      have their own extension membership entries in <structname>pg_depend</>,

      Prevent autovacuum transactions from running in serializable mode
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Autovacuum formerly used the cluster-wide default transaction isolation
      level, but there is no need for it to use anything higher than READ
      COMMITTED, and using SERIALIZABLE could result in unnecessary delays
      for other processes.

     <para>
      Restore the pre-9.1 behavior that PL/Perl functions returning
      <type>void</> ignore the result value of their last Perl statement;
      9.1.0 would throw an error if that statement returned a reference.
      Also, make sure it works to return a string value for a composite type,
      so long as the string meets the type's input format.
      In addition, throw errors for attempts to return Perl arrays or hashes
      when the function's declared result type is not an array or composite
      type, respectively.  (Pre-9.1 versions rather uselessly returned
      strings like <literal>ARRAY(0x221a9a0)</> or

    traditional relational-database feature set with new, ground-breaking
    functionality that is unique to <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
    The streaming replication feature introduced in release 9.0 is
    significantly enhanced by adding a synchronous-replication option,
    streaming backups, and monitoring improvements.
    Major enhancements include:

    for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.

    Version 9.1 contains a number of changes that may affect compatibility

       Change the default value of <link

       to on (Robert Haas)
      </para>

      <para>
       By default, backslashes are now ordinary characters in string literals,
       not escape characters.  This change removes a long-standing
       incompatibility with the SQL standard.  <link
       linkend="guc-escape-string-warning"><varname>escape_string_warning</></link>
       has produced warnings about this usage for years.  <literal>E''</>
       strings are the proper way to embed backslash escapes in strings and are
       unaffected by this change.
      </para>

      <warning>
       <para>
        This change can break applications that are not expecting it and
        do their own string escaping according to the old rules.  The
        consequences could be as severe as introducing SQL-injection security
        holes.  Be sure to test applications that are exposed to untrusted
        input, to ensure that they correctly handle single quotes and
        backslashes in text strings.

       Disallow function-style and attribute-style data type casts for

       For example, disallow
       <literal><replaceable>composite_value</>.text</literal> and
       <literal>text(<replaceable>composite_value</>)</literal>.
       Unintentional uses of this syntax have frequently resulted in bug
       reports; although it was not a bug, it seems better to go back to
       rejecting such expressions.
       The <literal>CAST</> and <literal>::</> syntaxes are still available
       for use when a cast of an entire composite value is actually intended.

       Tighten casting checks for domains based on arrays (Tom Lane)

       When a domain is based on an array type, it is allowed to <quote>look
       through</> the domain type to access the array elements, including
       subscripting the domain value to fetch or assign an element.
       Assignment to an element of such a domain value, for instance via
       <literal>UPDATE ... SET domaincol[5] = ...</>, will now result in
       rechecking the domain type's constraints, whereas before the checks
       were skipped.

       Type modifiers of PL/pgSQL variables are now visible to the SQL parser

      <para>
       A type modifier (such as a varchar length limit) attached to a PL/pgSQL
       variable was formerly enforced during assignments, but was ignored for
       all other purposes.  Such variables will now behave more like table
       columns declared with the same modifier.  This is not expected to make
       any visible difference in most cases, but it could result in subtle
       changes for some SQL commands issued by PL/pgSQL functions.

        Such tables provide better update performance than regular tables,
