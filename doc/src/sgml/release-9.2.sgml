      Fix sample server-start scripts to become <literal>$PGUSER</literal>
      before opening <literal>$PGLOG</literal> (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, the postmaster log file was opened while still running as
      root.  The database owner could therefore mount an attack against
      another system user by making <literal>$PGLOG</literal> be a symbolic
      link to some other file, which would then become corrupted by appending
      log messages.
     </para>

     <para>
      By default, these scripts are not installed anywhere.  Users who have
      made use of them will need to manually recopy them, or apply the same
      changes to their modified versions.  If the
      existing <literal>$PGLOG</literal> file is root-owned, it will need to
      be removed or renamed out of the way before restarting the server with
      the corrected script.

      Record proper dependencies when a view or rule

     </para>

     <para>
      Lack of these dependencies could allow a column or data
      type <command>DROP</command> to go through when it ought to fail,
      thereby causing later uses of the view or rule to get errors.
      This patch does not do anything to protect existing views/rules,

      Correctly detect hashability of range data types (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The planner mistakenly assumed that any range type could be hashed
      for use in hash joins or hash aggregation, but actually it must check
      whether the range's subtype has hash support.  This does not affect any
      of the built-in range types, since they're all hashable anyway.

     <para>
      In v10, failure to find the home directory while trying to
      read <filename>~/.pgpass</filename> was treated as a hard error,
      but it should just cause that file to not be found.  Both v10 and
      previous release branches made the same mistake when
      reading <filename>~/.pg_service.conf</filename>, though this was less
      obvious since that file is not sought unless a service name is

      This fixes various issues; the only one likely to be user-visible
      is that the default DST rules for a POSIX-style zone name, if
      no <filename>posixrules</filename> file exists in the timezone data

      Certain <command>ALTER</command> commands that change the definition of a

      infrastructure needed to update or check such values.  Previously,
      these checks could miss relevant values that are wrapped inside range
      types or sub-domains, possibly allowing the database to become

      A side-effect that may be visible to extension developers is
      that <literal>_USE_32BIT_TIME_T</literal> is no longer defined globally

      Further restrict visibility

      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <literal>USAGE</literal> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <structname>information_schema.user_mapping_options</structname> does not
      show the options in such cases, <structname>pg_user_mappings</structname>
      should not either.

      Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libpq</application> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <application>psql</application> or other <application>libpq</application>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<application>libpq</application>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <literal>md5</literal>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

      Prevent exposure of statistical information via leaky operators
      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <structname>pg_statistic</structname>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      Use correct daylight-savings rules for POSIX-style time zone names
      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </para>

     <para>
      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <filename>posixrules</filename> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <literal>US/Eastern</literal> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <filename>posixrules</filename> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <xref linkend="datatype-timezones">).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
      to take effect.

      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </para>

     <para>
      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations

      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.

     <para>
      A <literal>CASE</literal> expression appearing within the test value
      subexpression of another <literal>CASE</literal> could become confused about

     <para>
      Numerous places in <application>vacuumdb</application> and other client programs
      could become confused by database and role names containing double
      quotes or backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe.

      parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.

     <para>
      Introduce a new <option>-reuse-previous</option> option
      in <application>psql</application>'s <command>\connect</command> command to allow
      explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a

      the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This
      allows secure handling of database names containing special
      characters in <application>pg_dumpall</application> scripts.
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dumpall</application> now refuses to deal with database and role
      names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical

     <para>
      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names

     <para>
      The SQL standard specifies that <literal>IS NULL</literal> should return

      The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations
      treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases),

      Clear the OpenSSL error queue before OpenSSL calls, rather than
      assuming it's clear already; and make sure we leave it clear
      afterwards (Peter Geoghegan, Dave Vitek, Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents problems when there are multiple connections
      using OpenSSL within a single process and not all the code involved
      follows the same rules for when to clear the error queue.
      Failures have been reported specifically when a client application
      uses SSL connections in <application>libpq</application> concurrently with
      SSL connections using the PHP, Python, or Ruby wrappers for OpenSSL.
      It's possible for similar problems to arise within the server as well,
      if an extension module establishes an outgoing SSL connection.

     <para>
      Given a three-or-more-way equivalence class of variables, such
      as <literal>X.X = Y.Y = Z.Z</literal>, it was possible for the planner to omit
      some of the tests needed to enforce that all the variables are actually
      equal, leading to join rows being output that didn't satisfy
      the <literal>WHERE</literal> clauses.  For various reasons, erroneous plans
      were seldom selected in practice, so that this bug has gone undetected

      In such a case, the operator family was restored into the new database,

     <para>
      Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and
      parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing, according
      to the manual.  However, the code failed to handle these cases properly
      inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give unexpected

      The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it didn't
      handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect, in that it
      could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be no bad
      consequences of that in a non-assert build).  Multi-state loops would

      The POSIX standard for <literal>tar</literal> file format does not allow

      In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for
      members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms.  Potentially these

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</function>'ing data directory during
      crash restart (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</function>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would
      prevent restart on some platforms; but it is common to make SSL
      certificate files unwritable by the server.  Revise this behavior so
      that permissions failures are ignored altogether, and other types of
      failures are logged but do not prevent continuing.

      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the

     </para>

     <para>
      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)

     <para>
      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</function> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.

      It remains possible that some calls of the <function>*printf()</function>

     <para>
      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <filename>pgcrypto</filename>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.

      Fix incorrect declaration of <filename>contrib/citext</filename>'s

     <para>
      These functions should return <type>setof text[]</type>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <type>text[]</type>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <literal>g</literal> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </para>

     <para>
      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <literal>citext</literal> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <emphasis>not</emphasis> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <literal>ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</literal> in each database in
      which <literal>citext</literal> is installed.  (You can also <quote>update</quote>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that

      Remove code for matching IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> entries to

     </para>

     <para>
      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</application>'s

     </para>

     <para>
      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</literal>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</application>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <function>PQconsumeInput()</function> upon read-ready.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      Restore previous behavior of conversion of domains to JSON

     </para>

     <para>
      A <type>numeric</type> value's display scale (<literal>dscale</literal>) should
      never be less than the number of nonzero fractional digits; but
      apparently there's at least one broken client application that

      This leads to strange behavior since the extra digits are taken into
      account by arithmetic operations even though they aren't printed.
      The least risky fix seems to be to truncate away such <quote>hidden</quote>
      digits on receipt, so that the value is indeed what it prints as.

      Even when autovacuum is nominally off, we will still launch autovacuum
      worker processes to vacuum tables that are at risk of XID wraparound.
      However, such a worker process then proceeded to vacuum all tables in
      the target database, if they met the usual thresholds for
      autovacuuming.  This is at best pretty unexpected; at worst it delays
      response to the wraparound threat.  Fix it so that if autovacuum is
      turned off, workers <emphasis>only</emphasis> do anti-wraparound vacuums and
      not any other work.

     <para>
      The IANA timezone database has adopted abbreviations of the form
      <literal>A<replaceable>x</replaceable>ST</literal>/<literal>A<replaceable>x</replaceable>DT</literal>
      for all Australian time zones, reflecting what they believe to be
      current majority practice Down Under.  These names do not conflict
      with usage elsewhere (other than ACST for Acre Summer Time, which has
      been in disuse since 1994).  Accordingly, adopt these names into
      our <quote>Default</quote> timezone abbreviation set.
      The <quote>Australia</quote> abbreviation set now contains only CST, EAST,
      EST, SAST, SAT, and WST, all of which are thought to be mostly
      historical usage.  Note that SAST has also been changed to be South
      Africa Standard Time in the <quote>Default</quote> abbreviation set.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, add zone abbreviations SRET (Asia/Srednekolymsk) and XJT
      (Asia/Urumqi), and use WSST/WSDT for western Samoa.  Also, there were
      DST law changes in Chile, Mexico, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands
      (America/Grand_Turk), and Fiji.  There is a new zone
      Pacific/Bougainville for portions of Papua New Guinea.  Also, numerous
      corrections for historical (pre-1970) time zone data.

      Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during
      <literal>make check</literal> (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <filename>/tmp</filename>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.
     </para>

     <para>
      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <literal>make check</literal> testing in builds that
      override <literal>DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR</literal>.  Popular non-default values
      like <filename>/var/run/postgresql</filename> are often not writable by the
      build user, requiring workarounds that will no longer be necessary.

      Avoid buffer bloat in <application>libpq</application> when the server

     <para>
      <application>libpq</application> could be coerced into enlarging its input buffer
      until it runs out of memory (which would be reported misleadingly
      as <quote>lost synchronization with server</quote>).  Under ordinary
      circumstances it's quite far-fetched that data could be continuously
      transmitted more quickly than the <function>recv()</function> loop can

      Restore GIN metapages unconditionally to avoid torn-page risk

     <para>
      Although this oversight could theoretically result in a corrupted

      Shore up <literal>GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION</literal> restrictions
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</literal> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET
      ROLE</literal> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can
      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal> functions.

      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</command>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

      Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL
      (Robert Haas, Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts.  At least in the case of <command>CREATE INDEX</command>,
      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed
      against a different table than the index creation, allowing for a
      privilege escalation attack.

      Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      The <literal>MAXDATELEN</literal> constant was too small for the longest
      possible value of type <type>interval</type>, allowing a buffer overrun
      in <function>interval_out()</function>.  Although the datetime input
      functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the limit
      was short enough to cause them to reject some valid inputs, such as
      input containing a very long timezone name.  The <application>ecpg</application>
      library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.

      Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
      (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an
      allocation size without checking for overflow.  If overflow did
      occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past.

      Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers
      (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)
     </para>

     <para>
      Use <function>strlcpy()</function> and related functions to provide a clear
      guarantee that fixed-size buffers are not overrun.  Unlike the
      preceding items, it is unclear whether these cases really represent
      live issues, since in most cases there appear to be previous
      constraints on the size of the input string.  Nonetheless it seems
      prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of this type.

      Avoid crashing if <function>crypt()</function> returns NULL (Honza Horak,

     </para>

     <para>
      There are relatively few scenarios in which <function>crypt()</function>
      could return NULL, but <filename>contrib/chkpass</filename> would crash
      if it did.  One practical case in which this could be an issue is
      if <application>libc</application> is configured to refuse to execute unapproved
      hashing algorithms (e.g., <quote>FIPS mode</quote>).

      Document risks of <literal>make check</literal> in the regression testing
      instructions (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      Since the temporary server started by <literal>make check</literal>
      uses <quote>trust</quote> authentication, another user on the same machine
      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <literal>make check</literal> when there are untrusted users on the
      same machine.

      Fix possible mis-replay of WAL records when some segments of a

     </para>

     <para>
      The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially many
      pages past where it should have been.  Aside from corrupting data,
      this error has been observed to result in significant <quote>bloat</quote>
      of standby servers compared to their masters, due to updates being
      applied far beyond where the end-of-file should have been.  This
      failure mode does not appear to be a significant risk during crash
      recovery, only when initially synchronizing a standby created from a
      base backup taken from a quickly-changing master.

      In some cases WAL replay would mistakenly conclude that the database

      Fix <command>VACUUM</command>'s tests to see whether it can
      update <structfield>relfrozenxid</structfield> (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In some cases <command>VACUUM</command> (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's <structfield>relfrozenxid</structfield> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  In 9.2.0
      and later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible
      to get <quote>could not access status of transaction</quote> errors as a
      consequence of this bug.  Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8
      or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain the bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</varname></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <literal>SELECT txid_current() &lt; 2^31</literal>).

      Fix initialization of <filename>pg_clog</filename> and <filename>pg_subtrans</filename>
      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.

      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.

      Fix performance problems with autovacuum truncation in busy workloads
      (Jan Wieck)
     </para>

     <para>
      Truncation of empty pages at the end of a table requires exclusive
      lock, but autovacuum was coded to fail (and release the table lock)
      when there are conflicting lock requests.  Under load, it is easily
      possible that truncation would never occur, resulting in table bloat.
      Fix by performing a partial truncation, releasing the lock, then
      attempting to re-acquire the lock and continue.  This fix also greatly
      reduces the average time before autovacuum releases the lock after a
      conflicting request arrives.

     <para>
      Remove some data-copying overhead that was added in 9.2 as a
      consequence of revisions in the plan caching mechanism.  This

      SQL statements.
     </para>

     <para>
      A side benefit is that multi-statement query strings are now
      processed fully serially, that is we complete execution of earlier
      statements before running parse analysis and planning on the
      following ones.  This eliminates a long-standing issue, in that DDL
      that should affect the behavior of a later statement will now behave as

      Fix multiple bugs associated with <command>CREATE/DROP INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</command> (Andres Freund, Tom Lane, Simon Riggs, Pavan Deolasee)
     </para>

     <para>
      An error introduced while adding <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command>
      allowed incorrect indexing decisions to be made during the initial
      phase of <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command>; so that indexes built
      by that command could be corrupt.  It is recommended that indexes
      built in 9.2.X with <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> be rebuilt
      after applying this update.
     </para>

     <para>
      In addition, fix <command>CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <structname>pg_index</structname> row.  This prevents race conditions that could
      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      again resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <command>CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</command> command.  The most important of these is
      <command>VACUUM</command>, because an auto-vacuum could easily be launched
      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also fix <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> to not disable
      insertions into the target index until all queries using it are done.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also fix misbehavior if <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command> is
      canceled: the previous coding could leave an un-droppable index behind.

      Correct predicate locking for <command>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</command>

      Fix buffer locking during WAL replay (Tom Lane)

     <para>
      The WAL replay code was insufficiently careful about locking buffers

      Fix planning of non-strict equivalence clauses above outer joins
      (Tom Lane)

      <literal>WHERE COALESCE(foo, 0) = 0</literal>
      when <literal>foo</literal> is coming from the nullable side of an outer join.

      A strict join clause can be sufficient to establish an
      <replaceable>x</replaceable> <literal>IS NOT NULL</literal> predicate, for example.

      Revert patch for taking fewer snapshots (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The 9.2 change to reduce the number of snapshots taken during query
      execution led to some anomalous behaviors not seen in previous
      releases, because execution would proceed with a snapshot acquired
      before locking the tables used by the query.  Thus, for example,
      a query would not be guaranteed to see updates committed by a
      preceding transaction even if that transaction had exclusive lock.
      We'll probably revisit this in future releases, but meanwhile put it
      back the way it was before 9.2.

      In very unusual circumstances, this oversight could result in passing
      incorrect data to a trigger <literal>WHEN</literal> condition, or to the
      precheck logic for a foreign-key enforcement trigger.  That could
      result in a crash, or in an incorrect decision about whether to

      Fix persistence marking of shared buffers during WAL replay
      (Jeff Davis)
     </para>

     <para>
      This mistake can result in buffers not being written out during
      checkpoints, resulting in data corruption if the server later crashes
      without ever having written those buffers.  Corruption can occur on
      any server following crash recovery, but it is significantly more
      likely to occur on standby slave servers since those perform much
      more WAL replay.  There is a low probability of corruption of btree
      and GIN indexes.  There is a much higher probability of corruption
      of table <quote>visibility maps</quote>, which might lead to wrong answers
      from index-only scans.  Table data proper cannot be corrupted by this
      bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      While no index corruption due to this bug is known to have occurred
      in the field, as a precautionary measure it is recommended that
      production installations <command>REINDEX</command> all btree and GIN
      indexes at a convenient time after upgrading to 9.2.1.
     </para>

     <para>
      Also, it is recommended to perform a <command>VACUUM</command> of all tables
      while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</varname></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any incorrect visibility map data.  <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-cost-delay"><varname>vacuum_cost_delay</varname></link>
      can be adjusted to reduce the performance impact of vacuuming, while
      causing it to take longer to finish.

        (Magnus Hagander)

       <para>
        This field was duplicative of the symbolic links that actually define
        tablespace locations, and thus risked errors of omission when moving
        a tablespace.  This change allows tablespace directories to be moved
        while the server is down, by manually adjusting the symbolic links.
        To replace this field, we have added <link
        linkend="functions-info-catalog-table"><function>pg_tablespace_location()</function></link>
        to allow querying of the symbolic links.

        Change all <acronym>SQL</acronym>-level statistics timing values

       </para>

       <para>
        This change eliminates the designed-in assumption that the values
        are accurate to microseconds and no more (since the <type>float8</type>
        values can be fractional).
        The columns affected are
        <structname>pg_stat_user_functions</structname>.<structfield>total_time</structfield>,

        microseconds.

        Allow queries to retrieve data only from indexes, avoiding heap
        access (Robert Haas, Ibrar Ahmed, Heikki Linnakangas, Tom Lane)
       </para>

       <para>
        This feature is often called <firstterm>index-only scans</firstterm>.
        Heap access can be skipped for heap pages containing only tuples that
        are visible to all sessions, as reported by the visibility map; so
        the benefit applies mainly to mostly-static data.  The visibility map
        was made crash-safe as a necessary part of implementing this feature.

       <para>
        SP-GiST is comparable to GiST in flexibility, but supports

        Allow the planner to generate custom plans for specific parameter
        values even when using prepared statements
        (Tom Lane)
       </para>

       <para>
        In the past, a prepared statement always had a single
        <quote>generic</quote> plan that was used for all parameter values, which
        was frequently much inferior to the plans used for non-prepared
        statements containing explicit constant values.  Now, the planner
        attempts to generate custom plans for specific parameter values.
        A generic plan will only be used after custom plans have repeatedly
        proven to provide no benefit.  This change should eliminate the
        performance penalties formerly seen from use of prepared statements
        (including non-dynamic statements in PL/pgSQL).

        The new <quote>parameterized path</quote> mechanism allows inner

        The dependency links included in archive-format dumps were formerly
        of very limited use, because they frequently referenced objects that
        appeared nowhere in the dump.  Now they represent actual dependencies
        (possibly indirect) among the dumped objects.
