   Describes the available localization features from the point of

  <para>
   <productname>Postgres</productname> supports localization with
   three approaches:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Using the locale features of the operating system to provide
      locale-specific collation order, number formatting, and other
      aspects.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Using explicit multiple-byte character sets defined in the
      <productname>Postgres</productname> server to support languages
      that require more characters than will fit into a single byte,
      and to provide character set recoding between client and server.
      The number of supported character sets is fixed at the time the
      server is compiled, and internal operations such as string
      comparisons require expansion of each character into a 32-bit
      word.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Single byte character recoding provides a more light-weight
      solution for users of multiple, yet single-byte character sets.

 <sect1 id="locale">
  <title>Locale Support</title>
  
  <para>
   <firstterm>Locale</> support refers to an application respecting
   cultural preferences regarding alphabets, sorting, number
   formatting, etc.  <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses the standard ISO
   C and POSIX-like locale facilities provided by the server operating
   system.  For additional information refer to the documentation of your
   system.
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Overview</>

  <para>
    Locale support is not built into <productname>PostgreSQL</> by
    default; to enable it, supply the <option>--enable-locale</> option
    to the <filename>configure</> script:
<informalexample>
<screen>
<prompt>$ </><userinput>./configure --enable-locale</>
</screen>
</informalexample>
    Locale support only affects the server; all clients are compatible
    with servers with or without locale support.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information about which particular cultural rules to use is
    determined by standard environment variables.  If you are getting
    localized behavior from other programs you probably have them set
    up already.  The simplest way to set the localization information
    is the <envar>LANG</> variable, for example:
<programlisting>
export LANG=sv_SE
</programlisting>
    This sets the locale to Swedish (<literal>sv</>) as spoken in
    Sweden (<literal>SE</>).  Other possibilities might be
    <literal>en_US</> (U.S. English) and <literal>fr_CA</> (Canada,
    French).  If more than one character set can be useful for a locale
    then the specifications look like this:
    <literal>cs_CZ.ISO8859-2</>. What locales are available under what
    names on your system depends on what was provided by the operating
    system vendor and what was installed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Occasionally it is useful to mix rules from several locales, e.g.,
    use U.S. collation rules but Spanish messages.  To do that a set of
    environment variables exist that override the default of
    <envar>LANG</> for a particular category:

    <informaltable>
     <tgroup cols="2">
      <tbody>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_COLLATE</>
        <entry>String sort order</>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_CTYPE</>
        <entry>Character classification (What is a letter? What is the upper-case equivalent of this letter?)</>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_MESSAGES</>
        <entry>Language of messages</>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_MONETARY</>
        <entry>Formatting of currency amounts</>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_NUMERIC</>
        <entry>Formatting of numbers</>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>LC_TIME</>
        <entry>Formatting of dates and times</>
       </row>
      </tbody>
     </tgroup>
    </informaltable>

    <envar>LC_MESSAGES</> only affects the messages that come from the
    operating system, not <productname>PostgreSQL</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you want the system to behave as if it had no locale support,
    use the special locale <literal>C</> or <literal>POSIX</>, or
    simply unset all locale related variables.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that the locale behavior is determined by the environment
    variables seen by the server, not by the environment of any client.
    Therefore, be careful to set these variables before starting the
    postmaster. 
   </para>

   <para>
    The <envar>LC_COLLATE</> and <envar>LC_CTYPE</> variables affect the
    sort order of indexes.  Therefore, these values must be kept fixed
    for any particular database cluster, or indexes on text columns will
    become corrupt.  <productname>Postgres</productname> enforces this
    by recording the values of <envar>LC_COLLATE</> and <envar>LC_CTYPE</>
    that are seen by <command>initdb</>.  The server automatically adopts
    those two values when it is started; only the other <envar>LC_</>
    categories can be set from the environment at server startup.
    In short, only one collation order can be used in a database cluster,
    and it is chosen at <command>initdb</> time.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Benefits</>

   <para>
    Locale support influences in particular the following features:

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Sort order in <command>ORDER BY</> queries.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <function>to_char</> family of functions
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <literal>LIKE</> and <literal>~</> operators for pattern
       matching
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    The only severe drawback of using the locale support in
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> is its speed.  So use locale only if you
    actually need it.  It should be noted in particular that selecting
    a non-C locale disables index optimizations for <literal>LIKE</> and
    <literal>~</> operators, which can make a huge difference in the
    speed of searches that use those operators.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Problems</>

   <para>
    If locale support doesn't work in spite of the explanation above,
    check that the locale support in your operating system is okay.
    To check whether a given locale is installed and functional you
    can use <application>Perl</>, for example.  Perl has also support
    for locales and if a locale is broken <command>perl -v</> will
    complain something like this:
<screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>export LC_CTYPE='not_exist'</>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>perl -v</>
<computeroutput>
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LC_ALL = (unset),
LC_CTYPE = "not_exist",
LANG = (unset)
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
</computeroutput>
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    Check that your locale files are in the right location.  Possible
    locations include: <filename>/usr/lib/locale</filename> (Linux,
    Solaris), <filename>/usr/share/locale</filename> (Linux),
    <filename>/usr/lib/nls/loc</filename> (DUX 4.0).  Check the locale
    man page of your system if you are not sure.
   </para>

   <para>
    The directory <filename>src/test/locale</> contains a test suite
    for <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s locale support.

   <para>
    Multibyte (<acronym>MB</acronym>) support is intended to allow
    <productname>Postgres</productname> to handle
    multiple-byte character sets such as EUC (Extended Unix Code), Unicode and
    Mule internal code. With <acronym>MB</acronym> enabled you can use multi-byte
    character sets in regular expressions (regexp), LIKE, and some
    other functions. The default
    encoding system is selected while initializing your
    <productname>Postgres</productname> installation using
    <application>initdb</application>. Note that this can be
    overridden when you create a database using
    <application>createdb</application> or by using the SQL command
    CREATE DATABASE. So you can have multiple databases each with
    a different encoding system.
   </para>

   <para>
    <acronym>MB</acronym> also fixes some problems concerning 8-bit single byte
    character sets including ISO8859. (I would not say all problems
    have been fixed. I just confirmed that the regression test ran fine
    and a few French characters could be used with the patch. Please let
    me know if you find any problem while using 8-bit characters.)

     Here is an example of configuring
     <productname>Postgres</productname> to use a Japanese encoding by
     default:

     <programlisting>
% ./configure --enable-multibyte=EUC_JP
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     If the encoding system is omitted (./configure --enable-multibyte),

    <title>Setting the Encoding</title>

    <para>
     <application>initdb</application> defines the default encoding
     for a <productname>Postgres</productname> installation. For example:

     <programlisting>
% initdb -E EUC_JP
     </programlisting>

     sets the default encoding to EUC_JP (Extended Unix Code for Japanese).
     Note that you can use "--encoding" instead of "-E" if you prefer
     to type longer option strings. 
     If no -E or --encoding option is given, the encoding
     specified at configure time is used.
    </para>

    <para>
     You can create a database with a different encoding:

     <programlisting>
% createdb -E EUC_KR korean
     </programlisting>

     will create a database named "korean" with EUC_KR encoding.
     Another way to accomplish this is to use a SQL command:

     <programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE korean WITH ENCODING = 'EUC_KR';
     </programlisting>

     The encoding for a database is represented as an
     <firstterm>encoding column</firstterm>  in the
     <literal>pg_database</literal> system catalog.
     You can see that by using -l or \l of psql
     command.

    <para>
     <productname>Postgres</productname> supports an automatic

    </para>

    <para>
     To enable the automatic encoding translation, you have to tell
     <productname>Postgres</productname> the encoding you would like
     to use in frontend. There are
     several ways to accomplish this.

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Using the <command>\encoding</command> command in
	<application>psql</application>.
	<command>\encoding</command> allows you to change frontend
	encoding on the fly. For
	example, to change the encoding to SJIS, type:

	<programlisting>
\encoding SJIS
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Using libpq functions.
	<command>\encoding</command> actually calls
	PQsetClientEncoding() for its purpose.

	<programlisting>
int PQsetClientEncoding(PGconn *<replaceable>conn</replaceable>, const char *<replaceable>encoding</replaceable>)
	</programlisting>

	where <replaceable>conn</replaceable> is a connection to the backend,
	and <replaceable>encoding</replaceable> is an encoding you
	want to use. If it successfully sets the encoding, it returns 0,
	otherwise -1. The current encoding for this connection can be shown by
	using:

	<programlisting>
int PQclientEncoding(const PGconn *<replaceable>conn</replaceable>)
	</programlisting>

	Note that it returns the "encoding id," not the encoding symbol string
	such as "EUC_JP." To convert an encoding id to an encoding symbol, you
	can use:

	<programlisting>
char *pg_encoding_to_char(int <replaceable>encoding_id</replaceable>)
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Using <command>SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO</command>.

	Setting the frontend side encoding can be done by this SQL command:

	<programlisting>
SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'encoding';
	</programlisting>

	Also you can use SQL92 syntax "SET NAMES" for this purpose:

	<programlisting>
SET NAMES 'encoding';
	</programlisting>

	To query the current frontend encoding:

	<programlisting>
SHOW CLIENT_ENCODING;
	</programlisting>

	To return to the default encoding:

	<programlisting>
RESET CLIENT_ENCODING;
	</programlisting>
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Using <envar>PGCLIENTENCODING</envar>.

	If environment variable <envar>PGCLIENTENCODING</envar> is defined
	in the client's environment, that client encoding is automatically
	selected when a backend connection is made.  (This can subsequently
	be overridden using any of the other methods mentioned above.)

    <title>About Unicode</title>

    <para>
     An automatic encoding translation between Unicode and other
     encodings has been supported since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     Because this requires huge conversion tables, it's not enabled by default.
     To enable this feature, run configure with the
     --enable-unicode-conversion option. Note that this requires
     the --enable-multibyte option also.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>What happens if the translation is not possible?</title>

    <para>
     Suppose you choose EUC_JP for the backend, LATIN1 for the frontend,
     then some Japanese characters could not be translated into LATIN1. In
     this case, a letter that cannot be represented in the LATIN1 character set
     would be transformed as:

(HEXA DECIMAL)

     The WIN1250 character set on Windows client platforms can be used
     with <productname>Postgres</productname> with locale support
     enabled.
    </para>

    <para>
     The following should be kept in mind:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Success depends on proper system locales. This has been tested
	with RH6.0 and Slackware 3.6, with cs_CZ.iso8859-2 locale.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	Never try to set the server multibyte database encoding to WIN1250.
	Always use LATIN2 instead since there is not a WIN1250 locale
	in Unix.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	WIN1250 encoding is useable only for M$W ODBC clients. The
	characters are recoded on the fly, to be displayed and stored
	back properly.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     When running, it is important to remember the following:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This configuration reorders your sort order depending on your
	<envar>LC_<replaceable>x</replaceable></envar> settings. Don't be
	confused with the regression test results since they don't use
	locale.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	A locale such as "<literal>ch</literal>" is correctly sorted
	only if your system
	supports that locale; older systems may not do so but new ones
	(e.g. RH6.0) do.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	You have to insert money as '<literal>162,50</literal>' (note
	comma within the single-quotes).
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
	At the time of writing (early 1999), this configuration has
	not received extensive testing. Please let us know of any
	changes you had to make!
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <procedure>
     <title>WIN1250 on Windows/ODBC</title>
     <step>
      <para>
       Compile <productname>Postgres</productname> with locale enabled
       and the multibyte encoding set to <literal>LATIN2</literal>.
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       Set up your installation. Do not forget to create locale
       variables in your profile (environment). For example (this may
       not be correct for <emphasis>your</emphasis> environment):

       <programlisting>
LC_ALL=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
LC_COLLATE=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
LC_CTYPE=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
LC_MONETARY=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
LC_NUMERIC=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
LC_TIME=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2
       </programlisting>
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       You have to start the postmaster with locales set!
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       Try it with Czech language, and have it sort on a query.
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       Install ODBC driver for PgSQL on your M$ Windows machine.
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       Setup properly your data source. Include this line in your ODBC
       configuration dialog in the field <literal>Connect Settings</literal>:

       <programlisting>
SET CLIENT_ENCODING = 'WIN1250';
       </programlisting>
      </para>
     </step>

     <step>
      <para>
       Now try it again, but in Windows with ODBC.

  <title>Single-byte character set recoding</>
<!-- formerly in README.charsets, by Josef Balatka, <balatka@email.cz> -->

  <para>
   You can set up this feature with the <option>--enable-recode</> option
   to <filename>configure</>. This option was formerly described as
   <quote>Cyrillic recode support</> which doesn't express all its
   power. It can be used for <emphasis>any</> single-byte character
   set recoding.
  </para>

  <para>
   This method uses a file <filename>charset.conf</> file located in
   the database directory (<envar>PGDATA</>).  It's a typical
   configuration text file where spaces and newlines separate items
   and records and # specifies comments.  Three keywords with the
   following syntax are recognized here:
<synopsis>
BaseCharset      <replaceable>server_charset</>
RecodeTable      <replaceable>from_charset</> <replaceable>to_charset</> <replaceable>file_name</>
HostCharset      <replaceable>host_spec</>    <replaceable>host_charset</>
</synopsis>
  </para>

  <para>
   <token>BaseCharset</> defines the encoding of the database server.
   All character set names are only used for mapping inside of
   <filename>charset.conf</> so you can freely use typing-friendly
   names.
  </para>

  <para>
   <token>RecodeTable</> records specify translation tables between
   server and client.  The file name is relative to the
   <envar>PGDATA</> directory.  The table file format is very
   simple. There are no keywords and characters are represented by a
   pair of decimal or hexadecimal (0x prefixed) values on single
   lines:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>char_value</>   <replaceable>translated_char_value</>
</synopsis>
  </para>

  <para>
   <token>HostCharset</> records define the client character set by IP
   address. You can use a single IP address, an IP mask range starting
   from the given address or an IP interval (e.g., 127.0.0.1,
   192.168.1.100/24, 192.168.1.20-192.168.1.40).
  </para>

  <para>
   The <filename>charset.conf</> file is always processed up to the
   end, so you can easily specify exceptions from the previous
   rules. In the <filename>src/data/</> directory you will find an
   example <filename>charset.conf</> and a few recoding tables.
  </para>

  <para>
   As this solution is based on the client's IP address and character
   set mapping there are obviously some restrictions as well. You
   cannot use different encodings on the same host at the same
   time. It is also inconvenient when you boot your client hosts into
   multiple operating systems.  Nevertheless, when these restrictions are
   not limiting and you do not need multi-byte characters than it is a
   simple and effective solution.
