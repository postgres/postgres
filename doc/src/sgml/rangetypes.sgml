 <para>
  Range types are data types representing a range of values over some
  sub-type with a total order. For instance, ranges
  of <type>timestamp</type> might be used to represent the ranges of
  time that a meeting room is reserved. In this case the data type
  is <type>tsrange</type> (short for "timestamp range"),
  and <type>timestamp</type> is the sub-type with a total order.
 </para>

 <para>
  Range types are useful because they represent many points in a
  single value. The use of time and date ranges for scheduling
  purposes is the clearest example; but price ranges, measurement
  ranges from an instrument, etc., are also useful.

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-inclusivity">
  <title>Inclusive and Exclusive Bounds</title>
  <para>
  Every range has two bounds, the lower bound and the upper bound. All
  points in between those values are included in the range. An
  inclusive bound means that the boundary point itself is included in
  the range as well, while an exclusive bound means that the boundary
  point is not included in the range.
  </para>
  <para>
  An inclusive lower bound is represented by <literal>[</literal>
  while an exclusive lower bound is represented
  by <literal>(</literal> (see <xref linkend="rangetypes-construct">
  and <xref linkend="rangetypes-io"> below). Likewise, an inclusive
  upper bound is represented by <literal>]</literal>, while an
  exclusive upper bound is represented by <literal>)</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
  Functions <literal>lower_inc</literal>
  and <literal>upper_inc</literal> test the inclusivity of the lower
  and upper bounds of a range, respectively.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-infinite">
  <title>Infinite (unbounded) Ranges</title>
  <para>
  The lower bound of a range can be omitted, meaning that all points
  less (or equal to, if inclusive) than the upper bound are included
  in the range. Likewise, if the upper bound of the range is omitted,
  then all points greater than (or equal to, if omitted) the lower
  bound are included in the range. If both lower and upper bounds are
  omitted, all points are considered to be in the range.
  </para>
  <para>
  Functions <literal>lower_inf</literal>
  and <literal>upper_inf</literal> test the range for infinite lower
  and upper bounds of a range, respectively.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-io">
  <title>Input/Output</title>
  <para>
  The input follows one of the following patterns:
<synopsis>
(<replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable>,<replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable>)
(<replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable>,<replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable>]
[<replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable>,<replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable>)
[<replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable>,<replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable>]
empty
</synopsis>
  Notice that the final pattern is <literal>empty</literal>, which
  represents an empty range (a range that contains no points).
  </para>
  <para>
  The <replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable> may be either a string
  that is valid input for the sub-type, or omitted (to indicate no
  lower bound); and <replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable> may be
  either a string that is valid input for the sub-type, or omitted (to
  indicate no upper bound).
  </para>
  <para>
  Either the <replaceable>lower-bound</replaceable> or
  the <replaceable>upper-bound</replaceable> may be quoted
  using <literal>""</literal> (double quotation marks), which will allow
  special characters such as "<literal>,</literal>". Within quotation
  marks, "<literal>\</literal>" (backslash) serves as an escape
  character.
  </para>
  <para>
  The choice between the other input formats affects the inclusivity
  of the bounds. See <xref linkend="rangetypes-inclusivity">.
  </para>
  <para>
  Examples:
<programlisting>
-- includes point 3, does not include point 7, and does include all points in between
select '[3,7)'

-- does not include either 3 or 7, but includes all points in between
select '(3,7)'

-- includes only the single point 4
select '[4,4]'
</programlisting>
  </para>

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-construct">
  <title>Constructing Ranges</title>
  <para>
   Each range type has a constructor by the same name. The constructor
   accepts from zero to three arguments. The zero-argument form
   constructs an empty range; the one-argument form constructs a
   singleton range; the two-argument form constructs a range
   in <literal>[ )</literal> form; and the three-argument form
   constructs a range in a form specified by the third argument. For
   example:
<programlisting>
-- Three-argument form: lower bound, upper bound, and third argument indicating
-- inclusivity/exclusivity of bounds (if omitted, defaults to <literal>'[)'</literal>).
SELECT numrange(1.0, 14.0, '(]');

-- The int4range input will exclude the lower bound and include the upper bound; but the
-- resulting output will appear in the canonical form; see <xref linkend="rangetypes-discrete">.
SELECT int8range(1, 14, '(]');

-- Single argument form constructs a singleton range; that is a range consisting of just
-- one point.
SELECT numrange(11.1);

-- Zero-argument form constructs and empty range.
SELECT numrange();

-- Using NULL for a bound causes the range to be unbounded on that side; that is, negative
-- infinity for the lower bound or positive infinity for the upper bound.
SELECT numrange(NULL,2.2);
</programlisting>
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-discrete">
  <title>Discrete Range Types</title>
  <para>
  Discrete ranges are those that have a
  defined <literal>canonical</literal> function. Loosely speaking, a
  discrete range has a sub-type with a well-defined "step";
  e.g. <type>INTEGER</type> or <type>DATE</type>.
  </para>
  <para>
  The <literal>canonical</literal> function should take an input range
  value, and return an equal range value that may have a different
  formatting. For instance, the integer range <literal>[1,
  7]</literal> could be represented by the equal integer
  range <literal>[1, 8)</literal>. The two values are equal because
  there are no points within the integer domain
  between <literal>7</literal> and <literal>8</literal>, so not
  including the end point <literal>8</literal> is the same as
  including the end point <literal>7</literal>. The canonical output
  for two values that are equal, like <literal>[1, 7]</literal>
  and <literal>[1, 8)</literal>, must be equal. It doesn't matter
  which representation you choose to be the canonical one, as long as
  two equal values with different formattings are always mapped to the
  same value with the same formatting. If the canonical function is
  not specified, then ranges with different formatting
  (e.g. <literal>[1, 7]</literal> and <literal>[1, 8)</literal>) will
  always be treated as unequal.
  </para>
  <para>
  For types such as <type>NUMRANGE</type>, this is not possible,
  because there are always points in between two
  distinct <type>NUMERIC</type> values.
  </para>
  <para>
  The built-in range
  types <type>INT4RANGE</type>, <type>INT8RANGE</type>,
  and <type>DATERNAGE</type> all use a canonical form that includes
  the lower bound and excludes the upper bound; that is, <literal>[
  )</literal>. User-defined ranges can use other conventions, however.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="rangetypes-defining">
  <title>Defining New Range Types</title>
  <para>
  Users can define their own range types. The most common reason to do
  this is to use ranges where the subtype is not among the built-in
  range types, e.g. a range of type <type>FLOAT</type> (or, if the
  subtype itself is a user-defined type).
  </para>
  <para>
  For example: to define a new range type of sub-type <type>DOUBLE PRECISION</type>:
<programlisting>
CREATE TYPE FLOATRANGE AS RANGE (
  SUBTYPE = DOUBLE PRECISION
);

SELECT '[1.234, 5.678]'::floatrange;
</programlisting>
  Because <type>DOUBLE PRECISION</type> has no meaningful "step", we
  do not define a <literal>canonical</literal>
  function. See <xref linkend="SQL-CREATETYPE"> for more
  information.
  </para>
  <para>
  Defining your own range type also allows you to specify a different
  operator class or collation to use (which affects the points that
  fall between the range boundaries), or a different canonicalization
  function.

  <title>Indexing</title>
  <para>
   GiST indexes can be applied to a table containing a range type. For instance:
<programlisting>
CREATE INDEX reservation_idx ON reservation USING gist (during);
</programlisting>
  This index may speed up queries
  involving <literal>&amp;&amp;</literal>
  (overlaps), <literal>@&gt;</literal> (contains), and all the boolean
  operators found in this
  table: <xref linkend="range-operators-table">.

  </indexterm>
  <title>Constraints on Ranges</title>
  <para>
   While <literal>UNIQUE</literal> is a natural constraint for scalar
   values, it is usually unsuitable for range types. Instead, an
   exclusion constraint is often more appropriate
   (see <link linkend="SQL-CREATETABLE-EXCLUDE">CREATE TABLE
   ... CONSTRAINT ... EXCLUDE</link>). Exclusion constraints allow the
   specification of constraints such as "non-overlapping" on a range
   type. For example:
<programlisting>
ALTER TABLE reservation
  ADD EXCLUDE USING gist (during WITH &&);
</programlisting>
   That constraint will prevent any overlapping values from existing
   in the table at the same time:
<programlisting>
INSERT INTO  reservation VALUES
  ( '[2010-01-01 11:30, 2010-01-01 13:00)' );
-- Result: INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO  reservation VALUES
  ( '[2010-01-01 14:45, 2010-01-01 15:45)' );
-- Result:
--   ERROR:  conflicting key value violates exclusion constraint "reservation_during_excl"
--   DETAIL:  Key (during)=([ 2010-01-01 14:45:00, 2010-01-01 15:45:00 )) conflicts with
--            existing key (during)=([ 2010-01-01 14:30:00, 2010-01-01 15:30:00 )).
</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
   Combine range types and exclusion constraints
   with <link linkend="btree-gist">btree_gist</link> for maximum
   flexibility defining
   constraints. After <literal>btree_gist</literal> is installed, the
   following constraint will prevent overlapping ranges only if the
   meeting room numbers are equal:
<programlisting>

CREATE TABLE room_reservation
(
  room TEXT,
  during TSRANGE,
  EXCLUDE USING gist (room WITH =, during WITH &&)
);

INSERT INTO room_reservation VALUES
  ( '123A', '[2010-01-01 14:00, 2010-01-01 15:00)' );
-- Result: INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO room_reservation VALUES
  ( '123A', '[2010-01-01 14:30, 2010-01-01 15:30)' );
-- Result:
--   ERROR:  conflicting key value violates exclusion constraint "room_reservation_room_during_excl"
