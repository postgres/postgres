     <para>
      Fix EvalPlanQual rechecks involving CTE scans (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The recheck would always see the CTE as returning no rows, typically
      leading to failure to update rows that were recently updated.

     <para>
      Fix improper repetition of previous results from hashed aggregation in
      a subquery (Andrew Gierth)
     </para>

     <para>
      The test to see if we can reuse a previously-computed hash table of
      the aggregate state values neglected the possibility of an outer query
      reference appearing in an aggregate argument expression.  A change in
      the value of such a reference should lead to recalculating the hash
      table, but did not.

     <para>
      Fix timeout length when <command>VACUUM</> is waiting for exclusive
      table lock so that it can truncate the table (Simon Riggs)
     </para>

     <para>
      The timeout was meant to be 50 milliseconds, but it was actually only
      50 microseconds, causing <command>VACUUM</> to give up on truncation
      much more easily than intended.  Set it to the intended value.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Remove artificial restrictions on the values accepted
      by <function>numeric_in()</> and <function>numeric_recv()</>
      (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      We allow numeric values up to the limit of the storage format (more
      than <literal>1e100000</>), so it seems fairly pointless
      that <function>numeric_in()</> rejected scientific-notation exponents
      above 1000.  Likewise, it was silly for <function>numeric_recv()</> to
      reject more than 1000 digits in an input value.

      Disallow starting a standalone backend with <literal>standby_mode</>

     <para>
      This can't do anything useful, since there will be no WAL receiver
      process to fetch more WAL data; and it could result in misbehavior
      in code that wasn't designed with this situation in mind.

      Prevent failure of obsolete dynamic time zone abbreviations (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      If a dynamic time zone abbreviation does not match any entry in the
      referenced time zone, treat it as equivalent to the time zone name.
      This avoids unexpected failures when IANA removes abbreviations from
      their time zone database, as they did in <application>tzdata</>
      release 2016f and seem likely to do again in the future.  The
      consequences were not limited to not recognizing the individual
      abbreviation; any mismatch caused
      the <structname>pg_timezone_abbrevs</> view to fail altogether.

      Update time zone data files to <application>tzdata</> release 2016h
      for DST law changes in Palestine and Turkey, plus historical
      corrections for Turkey and some regions of Russia.
      Switch to numeric abbreviations for some time zones in Antarctica,
      the former Soviet Union, and Sri Lanka.
     </para>

     <para>
      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <productname>PostgreSQL</>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <structname>pg_timezone_names</>
      view nor used for output.
     </para>

     <para>
      In this update, <literal>AMT</> is no longer shown as being in use to
      mean Armenia Time.  Therefore, we have changed the <literal>Default</>
      abbreviation set to interpret it as Amazon Time, thus UTC-4 not UTC+4.

     <para>
      Fix possible mis-evaluation of
      nested <literal>CASE</>-<literal>WHEN</> expressions (Heikki
      Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      A <literal>CASE</> expression appearing within the test value
      subexpression of another <literal>CASE</> could become confused about
      whether its own test value was null or not.  Also, inlining of a SQL
      function implementing the equality operator used by
      a <literal>CASE</> expression could result in passing the wrong test
      value to functions called within a <literal>CASE</> expression in the
      SQL function's body.  If the test values were of different data
      types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused
      to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.  (CVE-2016-5423)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and
      role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)
     </para>

     <para>
      Numerous places in <application>vacuumdb</> and other client programs
      could become confused by database and role names containing double
      quotes or backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe.
      Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name
      parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.
     </para>

     <para>
      Fix handling of paired double quotes
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</>
      and <command>\password</> commands to match the documentation.
     </para>

     <para>
      Introduce a new <option>-reuse-previous</> option
      in <application>psql</>'s <command>\connect</> command to allow
      explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
      previous connection.  (Without this, the choice is based on whether
      the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This
      allows secure handling of database names containing special
      characters in <application>pg_dumpall</> scripts.
     </para>

     <para>
      <application>pg_dumpall</> now refuses to deal with database and role
      names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical
      to quote those characters safely on Windows.  In future we may reject
      such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.
     </para>

     <para>
      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
      containing special characters could have been used to execute
      commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser
      executes <application>pg_dumpall</> or other routine maintenance
      operations.  (CVE-2016-5424)

     <para>
      Fix corner-case misbehaviors for <literal>IS NULL</>/<literal>IS NOT
      NULL</> applied to nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      The SQL standard specifies that <literal>IS NULL</> should return
      TRUE for a row of all null values (thus <literal>ROW(NULL,NULL) IS
      NULL</> yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
      (thus <literal>ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL</> yields FALSE).
      The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations
      treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases),
      and <filename>contrib/postgres_fdw</> could produce remote queries
      that misbehaved similarly.

      Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in <function>to_number()</>
      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      In several cases the <function>to_number()</> function would read one
      more character than it should from the input string.  There is a
      small chance of a crash, if the input happens to be adjacent to the
      end of memory.

      Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths

     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by setting its XMAX)
      but did not WAL-log that action, thus risking data integrity problems
      if the page were spilled to disk and then a database crash occurred
      before the tuple update could be completed.

      Avoid consuming a transaction ID during <command>VACUUM</>
      (Alexander Korotkov)
     </para>

     <para>
      Some cases in <command>VACUUM</> unnecessarily caused an XID to be
      assigned to the current transaction.  Normally this is negligible,
      but if one is up against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more

     <para>

      Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for the same shared

     <para>
      Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum doesn't take
      long anyway; but in the case of a severely bloated catalog, it could
      result in all but one worker uselessly waiting instead of doing

      Clear the OpenSSL error queue before OpenSSL calls, rather than

      afterwards (Peter Geoghegan, Dave Vitek, Peter Eisentraut)
     </para>

     <para>
      This change prevents problems when there are multiple connections
      using OpenSSL within a single process and not all the code involved
      follows the same rules for when to clear the error queue.
      Failures have been reported specifically when a client application
      uses SSL connections in <application>libpq</> concurrently with
      SSL connections using the PHP, Python, or Ruby wrappers for OpenSSL.
      It's possible for similar problems to arise within the server as well,

      Perform an immediate shutdown if the <filename>postmaster.pid</> file

     <para>
      The postmaster now checks every minute or so
      that <filename>postmaster.pid</> is still there and still contains its
      own PID.  If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though it had

      is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs will get cleaned up without
      manual intervention; but it also serves to limit the bad effects if a

      could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be no bad
      consequences of that in a non-assert build).  Multi-state loops would

     <para>
      Except on Windows, this change also means that a <literal>pg_ctl start

     </para>

     <para>
      The POSIX standard for <literal>tar</> file format does not allow
      archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern implementations
      of <application>tar</> support an extension that fixes that.  Adopt
      this extension so that <application>pg_dump</> with <option>-Ft</> no
      longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of data, and so
      that <application>pg_basebackup</> can handle files larger than 8GB.
      In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for
      members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms.  Potentially these
      problems could cause unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup
      files.

      An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases
      caused <structname>pg_trigger_tgrelid_tgname_index</> to be omitted

      init file to be broken and silently ignored it, resulting in a
      significant degradation in session startup time.  In addition to fixing
      the bug, install some guards so that any similar future mistake will be

      in our usage of it.  Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and

      Avoid failures while <function>fsync</>'ing data directory during
      crash restart (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      In the previous minor releases we added a patch to <function>fsync</>
      everything in the data directory after a crash.  Unfortunately its
      response to any error condition was to fail, thereby preventing the
      server from starting up, even when the problem was quite harmless.
      An example is that an unwritable file in the data directory would
      prevent restart on some platforms; but it is common to make SSL
      certificate files unwritable by the server.  Revise this behavior so
      that permissions failures are ignored altogether, and other types of
      failures are logged but do not prevent continuing.

      Allow <application>libpq</> to use TLS protocol versions beyond v1
      (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a long time, <application>libpq</> was coded so that the only SSL
      protocol it would allow was TLS v1.  Now that newer TLS versions are
      becoming popular, allow it to negotiate the highest commonly-supported
      TLS version with the server.  (<productname>PostgreSQL</> servers were
      already capable of such negotiation, so no change is needed on the
      server side.)  This is a back-patch of a change already released in
      9.4.0.

      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </para>

     <para>
      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

      Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Our replacement implementation of <function>snprintf()</> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </para>

     <para>
      It remains possible that some calls of the <function>*printf()</>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      In <filename>contrib/pgcrypto</>, uniformly report decryption failures

     </para>

     <para>
      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether <filename>pgcrypto</>'s specific behaviors
      are likewise exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message.

      Fix incorrect declaration of <filename>contrib/citext</>'s
      <function>regexp_matches()</> functions (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      These functions should return <type>setof text[]</>, like the core
      functions they are wrappers for; but they were incorrectly declared as
      returning just <type>text[]</>.  This mistake had two results: first,
      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <literal>g</> flag
      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </para>

     <para>
      While the latter behavior is clearly a bug, there might be applications
      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <productname>PostgreSQL</> 9.5.
      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of
      the <literal>citext</> extension, while we have provided corrected
      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <emphasis>not</> installed by
      default).  To adopt the fix in pre-9.5 branches, execute
      <literal>ALTER EXTENSION citext UPDATE TO '1.1'</> in each database in
      which <literal>citext</> is installed.  (You can also <quote>update</>
      back to 1.0 if you need to undo that.)  Be aware that either update
      direction will require dropping and recreating any views or rules that
      use <filename>citext</>'s <function>regexp_matches()</> functions.

      Remove code for matching IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries to

     <para>
      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <filename>pg_hba.conf</> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

      Reduce risk of network deadlock when using <application>libpq</>'s

     <para>
      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <literal>COPY FROM
      STDIN</>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <application>libpq</>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <function>PQconsumeInput()</> upon read-ready.

      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of

      Some server error messages show the values of columns that violate

      mean exposing values that the user should not be able to see.  Adjust

     <para>
      A <type>numeric</> value's display scale (<literal>dscale</>) should

      apparently there's at least one broken client application that

      This leads to strange behavior since the extra digits are taken into
      account by arithmetic operations even though they aren't printed.
      The least risky fix seems to be to truncate away such <quote>hidden</>
      digits on receipt, so that the value is indeed what it prints as.

      The previous behavior resulted in basically ignoring these per-table

      Avoid wholesale autovacuuming when autovacuum is nominally off

     <para>
      Even when autovacuum is nominally off, we will still launch autovacuum
      worker processes to vacuum tables that are at risk of XID wraparound.
      However, such a worker process then proceeded to vacuum all tables in
      the target database, if they met the usual thresholds for
      autovacuuming.  This is at best pretty unexpected; at worst it delays
      response to the wraparound threat.  Fix it so that if autovacuum is
      turned off, workers <emphasis>only</> do anti-wraparound vacuums and
      not any other work.

      with usage elsewhere (other than ACST for Acre Summer Time, which has
      been in disuse since 1994).  Accordingly, adopt these names into
      our <quote>Default</> timezone abbreviation set.
      The <quote>Australia</> abbreviation set now contains only CST, EAST,
      EST, SAST, SAT, and WST, all of which are thought to be mostly
      historical usage.  Note that SAST has also been changed to be South
      Africa Standard Time in the <quote>Default</> abbreviation set.

      Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during
      <literal>make check</> (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <filename>/tmp</>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.
     </para>

     <para>
      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <literal>make check</> testing in builds that

      <application>libpq</> could be coerced into enlarging its input buffer
      until it runs out of memory (which would be reported misleadingly

     <para>
      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET

      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others

      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator

     </para>

     <para>
      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed

     </para>

     <para>
      There are relatively few scenarios in which <function>crypt()</>
      could return NULL, but <filename>contrib/chkpass</> would crash
      if it did.  One practical case in which this could be an issue is
      if <application>libc</> is configured to refuse to execute unapproved
      hashing algorithms (e.g., <quote>FIPS mode</>).

      Document risks of <literal>make check</> in the regression testing

     </para>

     <para>
      Since the temporary server started by <literal>make check</>
      uses <quote>trust</> authentication, another user on the same machine
      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <literal>make check</> when there are untrusted users on the
      same machine.

      The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially many

      Fix <command>VACUUM</>'s tests to see whether it can
      update <structfield>relfrozenxid</> (Andres Freund)
     </para>

     <para>
      In some cases <command>VACUUM</> (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's <structfield>relfrozenxid</> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  Users
      upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8 or earlier are not affected, but
      all later versions contain the bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all tables
      in all databases while having <link
      linkend="guc-vacuum-freeze-table-age"><varname>vacuum_freeze_table_age</></link>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <literal>SELECT txid_current() < 2^31</>).

      Fix initialization of <filename>pg_clog</> and <filename>pg_subtrans</>
      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.
     </para>

     <para>
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.

     <para>
      Dumping invalid indexes can cause problems at restore time, for example
      if the reason the index creation failed was because it tried to enforce
      a uniqueness condition not satisfied by the table's data.  Also, if the
      index creation is in fact still in progress, it seems reasonable to
      consider it to be an uncommitted DDL change, which
      <application>pg_dump</> wouldn't be expected to dump anyway.

      Fix performance problems with autovacuum truncation in busy workloads
      (Jan Wieck)
     </para>

     <para>
      Truncation of empty pages at the end of a table requires exclusive
      lock, but autovacuum was coded to fail (and release the table lock)
      when there are conflicting lock requests.  Under load, it is easily
      possible that truncation would never occur, resulting in table bloat.
      Fix by performing a partial truncation, releasing the lock, then
      attempting to re-acquire the lock and continue.  This fix also greatly
      reduces the average time before autovacuum releases the lock after a

     <para>
      Fix <command>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <structname>pg_index</> row.  This prevents race conditions that could
      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus

     <para>
      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <command>CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</> command.  The most important of these is

      Fix persistence marking of shared buffers during WAL replay
      (Jeff Davis)
     </para>

     <para>
      This mistake can result in buffers not being written out during
      checkpoints, resulting in data corruption if the server later crashes
      without ever having written those buffers.  Corruption can occur on
      any server following crash recovery, but it is significantly more
      likely to occur on standby slave servers since those perform much
      more WAL replay.  There is a low probability of corruption of btree
      and GIN indexes.  There is a much higher probability of corruption of
      table <quote>visibility maps</>.  Fortunately, visibility maps are
      non-critical data in 9.1, so the worst consequence of such corruption
      in 9.1 installations is transient inefficiency of vacuuming.  Table
      data proper cannot be corrupted by this bug.
     </para>

     <para>
      While no index corruption due to this bug is known to have occurred
      in the field, as a precautionary measure it is recommended that
      production installations <command>REINDEX</> all btree and GIN
      indexes at a convenient time after upgrading to 9.1.6.

      Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references
      (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      <function>xml_parse()</> would attempt to fetch external files or
      URLs as needed to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value,
      thus allowing unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data
      with the privileges of the database server.  While the external data
      wouldn't get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be
      exposed in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and
      in any case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be
      useful to an attacker.  (CVE-2012-3489)

      Prevent access to external files/URLs via <filename>contrib/xml2</>'s

     </para>

     <para>
      <application>libxslt</> offers the ability to read and write both
      files and URLs through stylesheet commands, thus allowing
      unprivileged database users to both read and write data with the
      privileges of the database server.  Disable that through proper use
      of <application>libxslt</>'s security options.  (CVE-2012-3488)

     <para>
      Also, remove <function>xslt_process()</>'s ability to fetch documents
      and stylesheets from external files/URLs.  While this was a
      documented <quote>feature</>, it was long regarded as a bad idea.
      The fix for CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than
      expend effort on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily
      remove it.

      Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages (Noah Misch)
     </para>

     <para>
      When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
      introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
      recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
      This would result in incorrect index search results.  The probability
      of such an error occurring in the field seems very low because of the
      timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be fixed.

      Fix crash-safety bug with newly-created-or-reset sequences (Tom Lane)

      If <command>ALTER SEQUENCE</> was executed on a freshly created or
      reset sequence, and then precisely one <function>nextval()</> call
      was made on it, and then the server crashed, WAL replay would restore
      the sequence to a state in which it appeared that no
      <function>nextval()</> had been done, thus allowing the first
      sequence value to be returned again by the next
      <function>nextval()</> call.  In particular this could manifest for

     <para>
      This situation can arise in <command>CREATE TABLE</> with
      <literal>LIKE</> or <literal>INHERITS</>.  The copied whole-row
      variable was incorrectly labeled with the row type of the original
      table not the new one.  Rejecting the case seems reasonable for
      <literal>LIKE</>, since the row types might well diverge later.  For
      <literal>INHERITS</> we should ideally allow it, with an implicit
      coercion to the parent table's row type; but that will require more

      A view that lists only a primary key column in <literal>GROUP BY</>,

      This avoids some corner-case problems, notably that Python doesn't

      If a password string contained the byte value <literal>0x80</>, the

      Release 9.1.2 provided a fix for collations of <type>citext</> columns

      installations, but that fix was incomplete: it neglected to handle arrays
      and domains over <type>citext</>.  This release extends the module's
      upgrade script to handle these cases.  As before, if you have already
      run the upgrade script, you'll need to run the collation update
      commands by hand instead.  See the 9.1.2 release notes for more

     <para>
      This bug concerns sub-SELECTs that reference variables coming from the
      nullable side of an outer join of the surrounding query.
      In 9.1, queries affected by this bug would fail with <quote>ERROR:
      Upper-level PlaceHolderVar found where not expected</>.  But in 9.0 and
      8.4, you'd silently get possibly-wrong answers, since the value
      transmitted into the subquery wouldn't go to null when it should.

      to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the common
      name has that string as a prefix.  Impersonating a server would also

      Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with vacuuming

     <para>
      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a

      that it should remove.  After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as <quote>could not

      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations.
      This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently
      that it was not diagnosed until now.  If you have reason to suspect
      that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index

     <para>
      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files only
      after the transaction commits.  In event of failure then (for instance,
      because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed to just emit a
      warning message and go on, since it's too late to abort the
      transaction.  This logic got broken as of release 8.4, causing such
      situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable database.

      Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's directories, but there
      are various reasons why this might fail (for example, incorrect

      code would panic, rendering the database unrestartable without manual
      intervention.  It seems better to log the problem and continue, since
      the only consequence of failure to remove the directories is some
      wasted disk space.

      Fix bugs in <literal>information_schema.referential_constraints</> view

     <para>
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key

      Since the view definition is installed by <application>initdb</>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this

      (Run <literal>pg_config --sharedir</> if you're uncertain where

      Make <filename>contrib/citext</>'s upgrade script fix collations of

     <para>
      Existing <type>citext</> columns and indexes aren't correctly marked as
      being of a collatable data type during <application>pg_upgrade</> from
      a pre-9.1 server, or when a pre-9.1 dump containing the <type>citext</>
      type is loaded into a 9.1 server.
      That leads to operations on these columns failing with errors
      such as <quote>could not determine which collation to use for string
      comparison</>.  This change allows them to be fixed by the same
      script that upgrades the <type>citext</> module into a proper 9.1
      extension during <literal>CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged</>.

      If you have a previously-upgraded database that is suffering from this

      found at the end of

      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </para>

     <para>
      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</> trigger and the
      <literal>CHECK</> trigger as one event.  The <literal>ON UPDATE</>
      trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

      Also, make sure it works to return a string value for a composite type,
      so long as the string meets the type's input format.
      In addition, throw errors for attempts to return Perl arrays or hashes
      when the function's declared result type is not an array or composite
      type, respectively.  (Pre-9.1 versions rather uselessly returned
      strings like <literal>ARRAY(0x221a9a0)</> or

    The streaming replication feature introduced in release 9.0 is

       to on (Robert Haas)
      </para>

      <para>
       By default, backslashes are now ordinary characters in string literals,
       not escape characters.  This change removes a long-standing
       incompatibility with the SQL standard.  <link
       linkend="guc-escape-string-warning"><varname>escape_string_warning</></link>
       has produced warnings about this usage for years.  <literal>E''</>
       strings are the proper way to embed backslash escapes in strings and are
       unaffected by this change.
      </para>

      <warning>
       <para>
        This change can break applications that are not expecting it and
        do their own string escaping according to the old rules.  The
        consequences could be as severe as introducing SQL-injection security
        holes.  Be sure to test applications that are exposed to untrusted
        input, to ensure that they correctly handle single quotes and
        backslashes in text strings.

       For example, disallow
       <literal><replaceable>composite_value</>.text</literal> and
       <literal>text(<replaceable>composite_value</>)</literal>.
       Unintentional uses of this syntax have frequently resulted in bug
       reports; although it was not a bug, it seems better to go back to
       rejecting such expressions.
       The <literal>CAST</> and <literal>::</> syntaxes are still available

       subscripting the domain value to fetch or assign an element.
       Assignment to an element of such a domain value, for instance via
       <literal>UPDATE ... SET domaincol[5] = ...</>, will now result in
       rechecking the domain type's constraints, whereas before the checks

       A type modifier (such as a varchar length limit) attached to a PL/pgSQL

        case of a server crash.  Their contents do not propagate to
        replication slaves, either.
