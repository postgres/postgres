INDEXES

* Use indexes in ORDER BY for restrictive data sets, min(), max()
* Pull requested data directly from indexes, bypassing heap data
* Use index to restrict rows returned by multi-key index when used with
  non-consecutive keys or OR clauses, so fewer heap accesses

  a matching index [limit]
* Improve LIMIT processing by using index to limit rows processed [limit]

* -Make index creation use psort code, because it is now faster(Vadim)
* -Allow creation of sort temp tables > 1 Gig
* Create more system table indexes for faster cache lookups

  float4, numeric/decimal too [optimizer]
* -Allow optimizer to prefer plans that match ORDER BY(Tom)

CACHE

* Cache most recent query plan(s) [prepare]

  perhaps using invalidation cache


MISC

* Improve Subplan list handling
* Allow Subplans to use efficient joins(hash, merge) with upper variable
  [subquery]
* use fmgr_info()/fmgr_faddr() instead of fmgr() calls in high-traffic
  places, like GROUP BY, UNIQUE, index processing, etc.
* improve dynamic memory allocation by introducing tuple-context memory
  allocation [memory]
* fix memory leak in cache code when non-existant table is referenced
* In WHERE tab1.x=3 AND tab1.x=tab2.y, add tab2.y=3
* pass atttypmod through parser in more cases [atttypmod]
