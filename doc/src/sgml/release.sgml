        we cannot use UTF8 because SGML Docbook does not support it

        do not use numeric _UTF_ numeric character escapes (&#nnn;),
        we can only use Latin1

<appendix id="release">
 <title>Release Notes</title>

  <para>
   The release notes contain the significant changes in each
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> release, with major features and migration
   issues listed at the top.  The release notes do not contain changes
   that affect only a few users or changes that are internal and therefore not
   user-visible.  For example, the optimizer is improved in almost every
   release, but the improvements are usually observed by users as simply
   faster queries.
  </para>

  <para>
   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
   viewing the <link linkend="git">Git</link> logs for each release.
   The <ulink
   url="https://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/"><literal>pgsql-committers</literal>
   email list</ulink> records all source code changes as well.  There is also
   a <ulink url="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=summary">web
   interface</ulink> that shows changes to specific files.
  </para>

  <para>
   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item.  Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.
  </para>

<!--
  When beginning a new major-release series, create a new release-NN.sgml
  file, removing the previous one, and change the &-reference here.
  Don't forget to update filelist.sgml.  Also, add a link to the on-line
  documentation for the newly forked-off branch in the list below.

  The reason for keeping each branch's release notes in a differently-named
  file is to reduce confusion when preparing minor-release updates.
  All the active branches have to be edited concurrently when doing that.
