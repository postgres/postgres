tutorial
========

This directory contains SQL tutorial scripts.  To look at them, first do a
	% make
to compile all the scripts and C files for the user-defined functions
and types.  (make needs to be GNU make --- it may be named something
different on your system, often 'gmake')

Then, run psql with the -s (single-step) flag:
	% psql -s

From within psql, you can try each individual script file by using
psql's \i <filename> command.
